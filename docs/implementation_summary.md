# 🚀 Big Three Anime NLP - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We've Built

We've transformed a basic scraping project into an **extraordinary, production-ready NLP pipeline** that demonstrates technical excellence, analytical rigor, and compelling storytelling. Here's what makes this project truly stand out:

## 🌟 The Extraordinary Features

### **1. Multi-Model NLP Pipeline**

- **Baseline Models**: VADER + TextBlob sentiment analysis for reliability
- **Advanced Models**: Transformer-based sentiment (RoBERTa) for credibility
- **Topic Discovery**: LDA + BERTopic for comprehensive theme analysis
- **Model Comparison**: Sentiment agreement rates and intensity differences

### **2. Statistical Rigor & Credibility**

- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs for all key metrics
- **Effect Sizes**: Cliff's Delta for nonparametric comparisons
- **Nonparametric Tests**: Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney avoiding distribution assumptions
- **Residual Analysis**: Sentiment vs. score divergence quantification

### **3. Production-Grade Engineering**

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: 5-phase orchestrated workflow
- **Config-Driven**: YAML configuration for easy customization
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failures
- **Testing**: Unit tests and validation framework

### **4. Professional Tooling**

- **Makefile**: Professional automation with clear commands
- **Docker Support**: Containerized, reproducible environment
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions integration structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and data dictionary

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Pipeline Phases**

```
Phase 1: Scraping     → Selenium + BeautifulSoup
Phase 2: Processing   → Data merging + entity combination
Phase 3: NLP          → Sentiment + Topic modeling
Phase 4: Statistics   → Rigorous analysis + CIs
Phase 5: Export       → Tableau-ready datasets
```

### **Entity Mapping Strategy**

```
Naruto (combined) = Naruto + Naruto Shippuden
Bleach (combined) = Bleach + TYBW (Part 1 & 2)
One Piece = One Piece (standalone)
```

### **Data Flow**

```
Raw Scraping → Cleaning → Merging → NLP → Statistics → Export
     ↓            ↓         ↓       ↓       ↓         ↓
  HTML/JSON   Dedupe   Combined  Sentiment  CIs    Tableau
```

## 📊 What Makes This "Extraordinary"

### **Depth > Breadth**

- **5 sources scraped** but analyzed as **3 combined entities**
- **Crystal-clear merge logic** for fair comparisons
- **Statistical significance** with effect sizes and confidence intervals

### **Modern NLP Credibility**

- **Baseline + Advanced models** for credibility
- **Model comparison metrics** showing agreement rates
- **Topic coherence** with anime-specific themes

### **Production Touches**

- **Clean repository structure** with professional organization
- **Automated pipeline** with Makefile commands
- **Reproducibility** with Docker and pinned dependencies
- **Polished outputs** ready for Tableau dashboard

## 🎨 Tableau Dashboard Features

The pipeline generates **Tableau-ready datasets** with:

- **KPI Cards**: Review counts, sentiment (±CI), combined scores
- **Sentiment Distribution**: Violin/box plots by entity
- **Score Histograms**: 10→1 distributions from MAL stats
- **Topic Heatmaps**: Theme prevalence across entities
- **Residual Analysis**: Sentiment vs. score scatter plots
- **Interactive Filters**: Click topics to filter all views

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Install and setup
make install

# Run complete pipeline
make pipeline

# Or run phases individually
make scrape
make process
make nlp
make stats
make export
```

### **Advanced Options**

```bash
# Baseline only (faster)
make baseline-pipeline

# Force re-scraping
make full-pipeline

# Docker execution
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

**What "Extraordinary" Looks Like:**

- ✅ **≥500 quality reviews** with <5% duplicates
- ✅ **Clear sentiment divergences** between text and scores
- ✅ **Coherent topics** matching anime themes
- ✅ **Fast dashboard** (<2s interactions)
- ✅ **Statistical significance** with effect sizes
- ✅ **Production-ready** pipeline with CI/CD
