# 🚀 Big Three Anime NLP - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What We've Built

We've made a **production-ready NLP pipeline** that demonstrates technical excellence, analytical rigor, and compelling storytelling.

## 🌟 The Features

### **1. Multi-Model NLP Pipeline**

- **Baseline Models**: VADER + TextBlob sentiment analysis for reliability
- **Advanced Models**: Transformer-based sentiment (RoBERTa) for credibility
- **Topic Discovery**: LDA + BERTopic for comprehensive theme analysis
- **Model Comparison**: Sentiment agreement rates and intensity differences

### **2. Statistical Rigor & Credibility**

- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs for all key metrics
- **Effect Sizes**: Cliff's Delta for nonparametric comparisons
- **Nonparametric Tests**: Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney avoiding distribution assumptions
- **Residual Analysis**: Sentiment vs. score divergence quantification

### **3. Production-Grade Engineering**

- **End-to-End Pipeline**: 5-phase orchestrated workflow
- **Config-Driven**: YAML configuration for easy customization
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful failures

### **4. Professional Tooling**

- **Makefile**: Professional automation with clear commands
- **Docker Support**: Containerized, reproducible environment
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions integration structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and data dictionary

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Pipeline Phases**

```
Phase 1: Scraping     → Selenium + BeautifulSoup
Phase 2: Processing   → Data merging + entity combination
Phase 3: NLP          → Sentiment + Topic modeling
Phase 4: Statistics   → Rigorous analysis + CIs
Phase 5: Export       → Tableau-ready datasets
```

### **Entity Mapping Strategy**

```
Naruto (combined) = Naruto + Naruto Shippuden
Bleach (combined) = Bleach + TYBW (Part 1 & 2)
One Piece = One Piece (standalone)
```

### **Data Flow**

```
Raw Scraping → Cleaning → Merging → NLP → Statistics → Export
     ↓            ↓         ↓       ↓       ↓         ↓
  HTML/JSON   Dedupe   Combined  Sentiment  CIs    Tableau
```


## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Quick Start**

```bash
# Install and setup
make install

# Run complete pipeline
make pipeline

# Or run phases individually
make scrape
make process
make nlp
make stats
make export
```

### **Advanced Options**

```bash
# Baseline only (faster)
make baseline-pipeline

# Force re-scraping
make full-pipeline

# Docker execution
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

**What success Looks Like:**

- ✅ **≥1500 quality reviews** with <5% duplicates
- ✅ **Clear sentiment divergences** between text and scores
- ✅ **Coherent topics** matching anime themes
- ✅ **Statistical significance** with effect sizes
- ✅ **Production-ready** pipeline with CI/CD

It's not just about scraping data; it's about:

- **Understanding fan emotions** beyond simple ratings
- **Discovering hidden themes** in thousands of reviews
- **Quantifying the gap** between what fans say and what they rate
- **Building a production system** that others can use and extend
