"To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

"I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers... When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old. Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet. What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens. All in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.",7,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_29452877f3,1
"Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade. What I love bout naruto is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters. Kishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be ""recognized"" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament. Watching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards ""omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already"" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names. One of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree. The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love. 10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today. I still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists. I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I my self im not a huge fan of typical shonene tropes that are used consistently, but i love how the original series gave us a much more powerful emotional impact to the show. In away it felt more humanized as apposed to the more generic super power elements of shipuuden.",10,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2e4e6db105,1
"I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess ""unadulterated"" is a strong word but I digress.. In any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. *Also, let it be known that the infamous ""Filler Arc"" is not part of this review. Naruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the ""mentor"" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz. The main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an ""idiot"" like most people tend to. Sakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the ""useless female"" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. Sasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to ""kill a certain man"" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc. As far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series. But, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. It also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing. One thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though ""friendship overcoming tragedy"" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show. Now this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves mentioning as it is annoying. The plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun. But, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better. I think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. The Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. In Summary: Story: 7 It takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes. Art: 8 First off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however. Sound: 8 Orochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic. Character: 8 Depending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama. Enjoyment: 9 Hell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. Overall: 8 To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. *If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past.

"ok so I've seen like 200+ series and i have to say that this is one pathetic series. i watched up to shippuden 50. im telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway. the plot is seriously lacking and its a pathetic excuse for a slice of life/action-drama type of show. im writing this for people who legitimately haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all. the characters are even worse. you have your over-zealous,untalented guy who thinks he can do anything if he tries hard enough. . .and he just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. look people this has been done MILLIONS! of times before so please if you haven't seen the series don't watch it. it will waste days of your life away for nothing. . .literally the series will take up 88 hours of your life! thats over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive. hell, it doesn't even have to be productive. you could probably have a better time watching paint dry! listen to me people, for gods sake i only watched as far as i did out of obligation to finish a series i started but it wasn't worth it! so PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!",1,Not Recommended,"Dec 19, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c521ad62f3,1
"I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time. So is it really? Well, that depends on who you ask. Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover. Story (10/10) - Ok, a lot of people gripe about the story of Naruto, saying it's cliche, moves too slowly, isn't interesting, or whatever. I have to admit, some of these complaints are well-founded. So why did I give it a 10/10? Because the story is so complex and well-done. A lot of this won't become obvious until Naruto: Shippudden, but this is a review of the original series, so, I digress. Naruto is set in a fictional universe where Shinobi (Ninja) are basically the entire cast. Most Shinobi aren't mercenaries, but instead, fight to protect their village, and complete missions to earn money for it. The main character is one such Shinobi, name ""Naruto"" (hence, the name of the series). Naruto is a rebellious, disrespectful, punk, yet he still wants to become a great ninja. He even aspires to become ""Hokage"" (the lead ninja of his village). While this may sound pretty cliche, you'll quickly realize that Naruto has a long way to go before he has any hope of becoming Hokage. This series goes through a lot of twists and turns. The story is too complicated to try to explain in this review, but the further along you go, you'll find that Naruto aspirations aren't easy to live up to. In the very first arc, Naruto and his companions are confronted by a powerful Shinobi who wants to kill the man they have been assigned to protect. The battle that ensued is what got me hooked on this show. The fights in general are nothing short of brilliant. If you like action, this anime is for you! The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to stop until you see how the fight is concluded. I also enjoy watching the characters learn new moves and apply them in combat situations. You'll see Naruto change from an annoying little punk, to a ninja who people actually start to respect for his perseverance and strength. Now, for the things people gripe about in this show. Oftentimes, a fight scene will be interrupted by a flashback or monologue, and this can get dull at times. I didn't mind so much the first time around, but it does hurt the rewatch value a bit. The story can move slowly at times, but most of the slowness is because of how complex the story truly is. The further you go, the deeper you'll see things get. Another thing people gripe about is the length. While it's true that 220 episodes is quite an undertaking, it's really not necessary to watch more than the first 135 episodes. Yes, you heard me correctly friends. The last 85 episodes of the show are nothing but a desolate wasteland, inhabited by nothing but the pile of vomit known as ""filler"". I only watched the first 40 episodes of filler before I'd had enough, and skipped on to Shippudden. Some of the filler arcs are truly terrible. You'll sit back and wonder how the creators of the show had the audacity to slap the name ""Naruto"" to the garbage you've been viewing (if you're brave enough to bother watching it). Hence, my review only covers the non-filler portions of the show. Do yourself a favor and skip the filler. It really isn't worth your time. Art (7/10) - Here the show isn't as strong. While the art is never distinctly poor, it's also not great either. I suppose at times it can't be helped when making a series as long as this one. The animation is often stepped up for fights, or more intense parts of the show, which does help considerably. The art is at least passable, and I was never really bothered by it. Definitely not a show you watch for the eye-popping scenery, though. Sound (7/10) - I must say that I really did enjoy the music at first. While it tended to use synthesizers a bit more than I cared for, it still distinctly fit the mood of the show. Some of the battle music was catchy, and managed to combine electric guitar with more traditional sounding string or wind instruments. However, the creators of the show didn't seem to think it was necessary to update their musical score once in awhile. This wouldn't have been a problem if the show wasn't 220 episodes long. Music that I had once enjoyed, began to grow a bit overused by the end of the series. It never grew to the point of bothering me, but had the show gone on much longer before the filler started, I might have thought differently. The music is good, just used for a few too many episodes. The voice acting was easily good enough for me as well. Not outstanding, but never distinctly bad either. Just don't watch the dubbed version. Naruto's voice alone will be enough to drive you insane. Character (9/10) - Getting to know the cast can be a bit daunting at first. I've never taken the time to count, but there must be at least 30+ characters who get a decent amount of screen time in this show. While this sounds very cumbersome, it actually helps the show quite a bit. each character has their own unique back story and their own battle techniques. While one might think that ninja from a particular village all use the same techniques, this couldn't be further from the truth. The styles of combat are so diverse, that it makes for some VERY interesting fight sequences. Sometimes one character is at a distinct disadvantage, and is forced to out think his opponent in order to win. If it weren't for the brilliantly done fights and interesting characters, this show would lose a lot of it's value. There is one drawback to all of these characters, though. Sometimes, a somewhat minor character will have a flashback in the middle of a fight. It does help to have some context for why they fight, but it gets old at times, especially if it's a minor character that no one really cares about. Despite this problem, the show does a good job of somehow making you hate a character in the beginning, and totally changing your opinion of them at one point or another. I can think of several examples of this. Another problem is that some of the main characters (aka Naruto) are kind of annoying. Naruto is honestly a complete moron in the beginning, and you probably won't like him much at first. He gets better as things go along, but you'll still cringe at him a few times early on. Another annoying character is the lead female: Sakura. Sakura spends the entire series being obsessed with Sasuke (the third member of Naruto and Sakura's three-man team) and never really does anything worthwhile. She spends her time sitting on the sidelines of fights and cheering for Naruto and Sasuke (she gets better in Shippudden, but once again, this isn't a Shippudden review). While this didn't bother me at first, it got kind of annoying when all Sakura could do for the entire series was yell ""Sasuke, Sasuke!"" But anyway, moving right along. Their sensei, Kakashi, is very calm and cool, and helps to balance out this team of knuckleheads. Naruto's an idiot, Sakura's useless, and Sasuke's a child prodigy, yet somehow, Kakashi turns them into a functional ninja team. An impressive feat, if you ask me. To sum it up, whatever shortcomings these characters have, you'll still find yourself rooting for them as they are put through fight after fight, trying to protect their village, the people they love, and what they believe in. For every character that annoys you, there will be at least one that you genuinely love. Even though I did a lot of complaining about the three central characters, I still found myself rather attached to them by the end of the series. The characters will do a good job of making you laugh throughout the series, and it helps to lighten the mood when you sometimes least expect it. As you can see based on the 9/10 I gave the characters, I definitely grew to like them. Despite all the complaints people have, the characters are still very well done. Enjoyment (10/10) - It's hard to be objective on this part of the review. I enjoyed it tremendously, but there are plenty of people who don't. I'd say give it a chance and see what you think. You'll probably know whether or not you'll like the show after the first arc is finished, which is about 17 episodes. Overall (10/10)- Were we on a slightly more precise scale, I might give it a 9.5. I've already said that I enjoyed it a lot, but let me try to sum things up for you: Pros: Lots of action! There are a lot of very well-done fights, which is one of the strongest points of the show. The characters are a good bit better than average, with a few annoying exceptions. The story is long, and complex, but very good. Cons: It's a long anime. 135 episodes (non-filler) for just the original series is a sizable undertaking. Some of the main characters are a bit on the annoying side, and it takes a few episodes before they grow up a little. The long filler arc at the end also turns people off, especially those who feel compelled to watch an entire anime without skipping the filler. Hopefully this helps! Thanks for reading!

"Proof that I will watch just about anything, or rather that I once had nothing better to do than watch this crap while waiting for Squidbillies to come on (Unknown Hinson fangirl). In either case, there are few anime out there that evoke a visceral reaction like Naruto. Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. See, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school. Naruto is about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me. What is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited. Honestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead. This is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like ""the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!"" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change). I just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.

"Having watched many different series of anime, I can understand why the &quot;elitest&quot; out there give this series a bad review; however, I can also say they're flat out wrong and biased. Naruto is a fantastic anime that doesn't get due credit where it's deserved. First off, it's true that the fillers of this anime that take up about the last 1/3 of this Part 1 are flat out terrible. With the exception of the first two arcs (including the amazing Bikouchi retrieval arc) they're probably the worst anime I've ever seen and the fillers in Naruto Shippuden are just as bad. But I think as anime watchers, we should recognize fillers when we see them and simply ignore them. The anime itself is well-done with some of the most memorable tunes you will ever hear. I currently have one of the everyday tunes as my cellphone jingle - it's that catchy. The plot is original and fun, which is why Naruto has taken off to such enormous heights. The characters are all amazing and it's common knowledge that Kakashi and Itachi are two of the most bad-ass characters of all time in any anime. Everyone can find a character to relate to. From the lovable Rock Lee and Hinata to the inpalpable Gaara and Sasuke, we all find something to cheer for or hold onto in this anime, making it addicting. Those who give this anime a bad review refuse to acknowledge the points that make this one of the greatest and most popular anime of all time. It's their loss. Yu-Gi-Oh was the same way. You accept it or you don't, but if you don't like it, most people will disagree with you, which makes you wrong by consensus. Try the first 15 episodes and give it an honest try. By the time the Kakashi/Zabuza fight rolls around, you might just get hooked. Don't say I didn't warn you.",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e07a6a7adb,1
"This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series. Now that's saying a lot. Ok now on to some of the things that made it so bad. First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago. Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place. Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas. Which wouldn't have been so bad had the creators focused on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action. Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary. Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters. I'll focus on Naruto. He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series. Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show. The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke. Ok moving on to the so called action. First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes. Finally there's the length of the so called series. There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs. I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money. Now don't get me wrong I know studios are trying to make money, but theirs a difference between making money and ripping people off. So please don't support this show anymore.",1,Not Recommended,"Oct 30, 2007",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bc974426e0,1
"Naruto is a hit or miss show. You love it, or you hate it. I mean, how many times have you heard from Narutards calling it &quot;the best anime ever&quot;? How many times have you heard from Naruto haters calling it &quot;the worst anime ever&quot;? Both have ruined the Naruto fan base, so now no one pays attention to Naruto anymore. I hope this review will get at least one person to try Naruto, even if it turns out they don't like it. The story is basically about the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, and his journey on becoming the greatest ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village. No one believes that Naruto can do this, seeing how this is because Naruto is a hooligan due to the loss of his parents at a young age, and how no one is friends with him because Naruto has a kyuubi, or demon fox, sealed inside of him that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto isn't officially a ninja yet, so he takes the ninja test. He fails the test by his teacher, Iruka. Later, the other teacher in charge of the Ninja Academy, Mizuki, tells Naruto he can pass the test if he can get the ninja scroll, which is actually a scroll with every ninja jutsu known to man. Mizuki is actually taking the advantage of Naruto to take the scroll and destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. Iruka hears about this, and challenges Mizuki in combat, but is unable to win. Naruto then challenges Mizuki to combat after Iruka loses, even though Mizuki has the advantage, Naruto defeats Mizuki because he studied a technique in the scroll. Naruto is now able to not only clone himself with the jutsu, but able to clone about 100 of himself. Iruka then passes Naruto as a ninja, and is put in squads with Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Kakashi Hatake, the team leader who is the second closest ninja in the whole series. After Naruto is put in squads, the series moves on to arcs, the Zabuza arc, the Chunin Exam arc (which basically every character in the Naruto series is introduced), the Orochimaru arc, the Jiraiya arc, and the Tsunade arc. All those arcs last up to episode 100. Even though Naruto has a basic story, each episode has it's own story to it, making each episode unique in it's own way. I therefore like Naruto's story because of this, which makes episode to episode enjoyable. The art from Naruto isn't superb, but this probably because the anime was made in 2002. But this is an excuse, because the anime Fruits Basket was made a year before Naruto, and had superb art. The art looks basic, like One Piece and Bleach's art style. Naruto is a ninja anime, but if you couldn't tell already, none of the characters in Naruto look like ninjas. I mean, orange jumpsuits? Have you ever seen a ninja in an orange jumpsuit? Basically none of the characters wear black and cover their face with a mask, except for Kakashi, but that's his personal preference, not because the creator wanted one character to look like a ninja. Even though the art improved throughout the series, the animation still had plainness to it, so therefore I can't give the animation a great score. The soundtrack that waws in Naruto was pretty good, and it fits in parts where it needed to be. A lot of people don't really enjoy the soundtrack, but I think the composers did a great job on the upbeat themes for combat and sad music for dramatic moments. And the voice acting was good for each character in both dubbed and subbed versions. Naruto has an arrogant whiny voice, Sakura has a self-sufficient bitchy voice, Sasuke has an assholish angry voice, and Kakashi has a leader-type of voice. I would go more on to voice acting of other characters, but there are too many characters to list. Now on to the characters. There are a lot of good characters in Naruto, but some characters ruin great parts of the show. Naruto is a great main protagonist, who won't stop until he gets what he wants. Kakashi is a great leader, and always puts others before himself. Both Hinata and Neji Hyuuga are great characters for being strongly developed with the story line and courageous, and Tenten for being the closest of a ninja in the anime. Now some of the characters I don't really like. Sakura is bitchy and whiny, all she does is &quot;ADORE&quot; Sasuke, and is a useless ninja. Ino Yamanaka, because she is the most useless character in almost any anime, and Shikamaru Nara, for being boring. Therefore the characters I didn't like didn't necessarily ruin the series, but it sure didn't improve it. I'm just going to say it, Naruto is one of my favorite animes, and almost my favorite anime series. Even though I didn't give everything a perfect score, there is one thing I can give a 10- enjoyment. I enjoyed almost every single bit of Naruto, all the way to episode 220. Naruto might not be perfect, but to me it was perfect enjoyment.",10,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0b864cef3f,1
"Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first 135 episodes. Story: It was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until Sasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part 2] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden) Art: A bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic. Sound: If you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else. Characters: They are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters. Overall: I loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode 135 and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it. 8/10",8,Recommended,"Jan 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_44198d9465,1
"Story: Naruto is a fairly decent anime that made quite a bit of mistakes, such as turning over half of the show into fillers, and taking the show into &quot;god&quot; level Dragon Ball Z style of fighting. Naruto starts out as a extremly good Ninja anime during its first season where everything you see is unexpected and the story is rather fresh and interesting, the first season including Zabuza had a perfect pace and the fight scenes felt truly of what ninjas should be. After the first season however we are left with a quickly declining anime, soon the fights becomes my &quot;special move is better then yours&quot; and it doesnt really feel like its a ninja show anymore with everyone pretty much using random attacks, which essentially turns this show into another beat em up. After a couple of seasons they start to follow in the footsteps of Dragon Ball Z. Art: The characters are well drawn, and the moves are flashy and nicely animated fight sequences. Sound: While many of the music and songs of the anime are amazing, this show became plagued with... DATTEBAYO! ('Believe it' in english) Character: A large array of characters with each a rather decent background, however because they wanted each character to have such a rich and fulfilling history, we became flooded with flashbacks. Also only a few characters truly stand out in terms of growth and development such as Gaara, Neji, Shikamaru and a few others. Enjoyment: I decided to rate the seasons individually and then average them, with Season 1 and 5 recieving highest marks.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 8, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da44cf7bf6,1
"Wow... I look back and realize how painfully mediocre Naruto is compared to all the Anime I have watched recently... Its a shonen series, but it isnt really special... Just another addition to the &quot;boredom-inducing-fillertastic&quot; pile of anime in the end. It seems that many people have overrated this series because it was one of their first series, and they havent really watched many series anyways... -just a thought (All you hardcore fans keep reading, I explain myself) Overall: Naruto had the setup to be something epic, though the length and the way they tell the story completely destroyed what chance they had at becoming epic. They dragged out the story to include useless extra stuff, and though the characters had some depth, they kept trying to add more depth and not really adding much at all, just wasting time. The whole of Naruto is filled with episodes where you dont really get anywhere both in character development and story development, even the non-filler episodes did not do that well in developing the series in general. I admit, I liked watching Naruto at first, when I didnt really have much experience with much anime, now I look back and man does it look like crap compared to things like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion or Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann, or even Black Lagoon, I can understand why people that are fresh into anime are easily turned into &quot;Narutards&quot; now, just like the &quot;Pokemaniacs&quot; back in the day. This series is on a path that leads to a &quot;Inuyasha&quot; kind of standing. Story: Kid wants to be mayor of ninja town, ok thats nice, but has he REALLY gotten much further to ACTUALLY becoming &quot;Hokage&quot; in the last 200+ eps of this roundabout story? fillers killed what little naruto had in story. The way they stretched the story to encompass EVERY LITTLE THING is its main flaw, little side stories are nice and everything, but if you overdo it, you are just adding a giant mass of fat to the bone, no meat. If they just made Naruto something like a 2 season shot or something less then 50 episodes, then there might have been an epic anime that is worthy of being in the group of truly great anime. Art: meh... its not anywhere near as impressive as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with its 30million yen budget per episode, but it at least doesnt have any major flaws, though the art seems pretty bland sometimes, other times, the art is overly complex for what they are trying to show, but usually there isnt much of a problem in art. Sound: i never really liked the kind of atmosphere that the background music made me feel, it wasnt epic, the background music didnt really fit the situations very well, for example the overpowering flute in most of the bmg and the apparent manly &quot;HUA!&quot; that is overused do not really set much of a mood, I understand that there is a theme towards more traditional Japanese type of music, but it doesnt work well in many cases, there are way too many times where it just wont set the mood right and they beat the crap out of the dead horse, its hard to explain very well, Im raising my score to a 5 because AKFG and Sambomaster sang openings for it and they worked well with the anime. Character: There is a very large cast in Naruto, though its usually a bad thing, they made it work somewhat. Even though the characters are somewhat deep, they all consist of cliched stereotypical shonen characters and do not have much to set them apart from the giant mass of other shonen story characters, also nothing EVER changes in the personality of the main character, Naruto, though he is cheerful, optimistic and energetic, he never realizes the reality he lives in and due to a lot of dumb luck and his gift of insane power he passes all his trials and tribulations, he is so naive that it is painful to watch, he almost never has a mature or realistic look on things, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEUD WITH SASUKE, even then he still does not have a mature attitude in many situations. His development is like Arika in &quot;Mai-Otome&quot;, painfully naive, though he doesnt even advance as far as Arika in maturing, at least she somewhat matured throughout the story. There are good characters in the mix, for example, Shikamaru and Garaa are pretty well developed characters that have promise. However with all that said, Naruto kills EVERYTHING in character, its amazing how dumb he is sometimes, dumb to the point where he should get himself checked for mild autism, unfortunately he usually blocks out the possibility of good mature side characters with his obnoxiousness. I guess there was more then one reason people tended to stay away from Naruto, besides the fact he has a fire fox's spirit sealed within him. Enjoyment: it was enjoyable when I started watching it and it stayed that way for about 100 episodes, then it just tanked... now I have no intention of taking this up again. The amount of entertainment is not enough to keep me interested, nothing like Detective Conan, which nearly only uses its entertainment value to keep me interested.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f525698762,1
"Uh what a bad anime. STORY Classic zero to hero story. But it's a very lazy story and full of bullshit. The power balance of the characters is ridiculous. Very weak characters can suddenly get power-ups and be victorious. The relationship between Sasuke and Naruto makes me to my stomach. It seems so fake that people who hate each other so much have weird love. ART The visuals are very bad as they have to shoot so many episodes. There is almost no fighting animation. Have silly word duels. SOUND Naruto's voice is incredibly annoying. Other than that no problem. CHARACTER Oh man... I hate Naruto,Sasuke and Sakura really bad. All of them are incredibly frustrating.

"Naruto, who doesn't know about it? It's a wildly popular series that is controversial-- oh, almost every worldwide-known series is like that. First of all, i just don't get how people keep on complaining about this series. Like, those who gave this series a one-two-three ratings, i wonder what is wrong with them? They better came up with acceptable reasons. And oh-- maybe most of them thought that they're some sort of experts just because they've seen so many other animes besides this (even though they seriously can't make any better show-- note, MAKE-- than this show). I dislike those kinds of ppl that keeps on complaining due to some unclear reasons. And i know that this review might get me hated somehow, but whatever. Here are my thoughts. The story is your stereotypical shounen-ish, capturing a parallel Ninja world, where almost everybody is a ninja and they have some cool superpowers (that's what i call), and there's this weak and stupid main character that eventually grows along the story. To me, the story is a masterpiece. Like, this is one of the first ninja shows at that time, and it pretty much introduced to us how are ninjas like. The main plot itself is unbelievably good (to me, dunno how everyone else feels), a boy that holds some kind of massive power inside of him that remains hidden, but at some moments it will come out. And i also love the idea of making 1-tailed, 2-tailed until 9-tailed monsters, that really got me. Aaand also the awesome techniques and awesome creatures. Until this point, i like almost everything from the story. It quickly catches our attention and it easily makes everyone to sit back and enjoy the show. I watched this show for the first time when i was 10, and like all kids, i instantly got hooked. Indeed, it has some undeniable flaws, like its cliche and guessable story, and maybe some spots of gary stu, to say. But, isn't that all shounen series all about? How the main character who was nothing in the beginning, began to grow and finally becomes something? It was okay enough for me. The fights themselves were also fun and made me eager to watch, and it's even okay to watch it again and again. It's never boring and to me, the story never grows old. Well, Naruto is one of my childhood memories so i might sounded a little bit biased. But that is to me. The characters are-- god, there were like tons of them. Besides the main characters there were absolutely lots of supporting characters that appeared just in some stories and later never showed up again. I absolutely love the way they designed the characters with their unique traits, and note that the design has lots of varieties and i was never bored to see some new characters appearing because they're not the same, they're different. I sometimes thought how could ppl design so many people (because in my case, it's so hard to draw even 10 different faces). Well, Kishimoto looked really professional on designing the characters. Lots of different types of hairstyles (from the normal one until the absurd one), clothes (this one is definitely amusing), and so on. The animation itself is pretty colorful to me, and fight scenes (which is the soul of this series) were drawn neatly. And the sound effects--- for god's sake, i love the BGMs!! There are dozens-- or maybe more-- of sound effects, background musics, and opening-ending song in this anime. 220 episodes is not a short one, and they definitely made it not boring with the music. I could note some songs that i really like coming from Naruto. Toshiro Masuda really, really gave me the thrills with his awesome BGMs whenever we're watching some scenes and then dramatic BGMs that absolutely fits the story begins to play. Music is one of the best aspects in this series, tho. I even downloaded some of them to escort me on doing things. Yeah right. Naruto... is a really enjoyable series. Indeed, as i stated before, it's not perfect. No series are perfect. The best series ever known also came up with some minor flaws. And so is Naruto. Maybe you guys are irritated with the characters, or maybe the typical storyline, or maybe the absurd length of this series, you guys have your own opinions. I'm not a professional or whatsoever, i'm just an ordinary kid who enjoys watching animes. And these are my opinions.",10,Recommended,"Apr 5, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a24770c095,1
"Naruto is my favorite anime series and manga series. I started reading the manga when I was a pre-teen but dropped it after a while, because certain story elements bothered me (such as Naruto's unrelenting love for his rival). However, when I was 17 I picked it up again because I was bored and had nothing to read, I was hooked all over again, part 2 starts slow but it picks up, and when I say that I mean it gets extremely epic and interesting. But this review is about Part 1, and the anime adaption of it. Well, part 1 Naruto tells the story of a young Tom Sawyer-ish trouble maker kid who wants to be a ninja. It doesn't take long for him to graduate ninja school and begin his journey to become a legendary shinobi, however it's not just Naruto to watch this show for, the supporting cast and antagonists, especially in Part 1, are what make this story shine. Some of the most beautifully sad stories I've ever read/seen (in this case seen) are depicted within this anime, and it's just an amazing story that no one should miss. It enthralled me as a child, and astounded me as an adult, the level of thought, symbolism, and hidden details within this story could only be crafted by geniuses, which would be Kishimoto and his editors. All the characters are interesting, have unique personalities, sometime horrific pasts and secrets, and a good lot of them are extremely likable, such as everyone's favorite teacher Kakashi or the goofy underdog with passion Rock Lee. Even some of the most menacing antagonists you'd never think you'd care about, suddenly show that even they are worth your empathy. There's a good reason this is the biggest hit anime series to sweep america, and that's due to the overwhelmingly strong story, characters, and masterfully orchestrated soundtrack. Now, sure it's amazing, but there are negatives, most which are exclusive to the anime adaption and not the manga. While the anime adaption does a great job portraying the most important scenes, with fantastic animation and great music placement and sound, the entire thing isn't this way. This is because different directors and animation teams worked on different parts of the show, so one director could be brilliant, and one could have a lower budget and not be so brilliant, thus the art and execution are inconsistent in areas. That's not the only negative however, this show has these annoying things called fillers, which are additional story arcs added on that weren't part of Kishimoto's original manga. These are pretty cheesy and badly written and should be skipped, except for a particular comedic episode about attempted to remove Kakashi's mask. If you want to enjoy the show to it's full potential these should be skipped, especially the huge lot of them towards the end. Another thing is censorship. In the manga, there are some scenes that are just far to graphic for whatever timeslot the anime aired in Japan, such as a particular scene where a rogue shinobi is has naked corpses hung on the walls and is removing their limbs and dissecting them. Scenes like this are replaced with stuff that's less graphic but still sorta gets the point across. It's a shame such a great anime with a strong soundtrack and legendary source material has such blaring issues, but that's what bumps it down to a 9, it isn't a perfect adaption, has inconsistent art (but great at times) and various other annoying changes or additions that hamper my enjoyment of the Naruto manga in motion. I recommend skipping the fillers for the best viewing experience, but regardless, this is a story you won't forget, with characters you won't forget, moments you won't forget, and feelings you won't forget. There's no score more appropriate for this show other than a 9/10.",9,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_cbdc3e5b31,1
"The mighty roar of a Kyubei vibrated throughout the area as a crowd of ninja from Konoha try their hardest to bring it to its knees. All the fighting is for naught until one person steps up and sacrifices himself to seal the Kyubei away. That man was known as the Fourth Hokage. Years later, a young orphan named Naruto causes much vandalism and trouble, just to get the attention he craves each day. His life goal is to become the next Hokage. Kishimoto Masashi has brought us a very long series of action, drama, and comedy about a young ninja in training known as Naruto. This particular series focuses on the trials and tribulations of the young shounen who has only one life goal in mind: To become the greatest Hokage in Konoha village. Along with Naruto, he has a few friends who he has earned respect from. One such colleague is more of a mentor than a friend, and that certain person is Umino Iruka-sensei. Someone who was similar to Naruto when he was growing up, so he is the first person to understand what Naruto goes through. The next few are Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura, along with their sensei Hatake Kakashi. Now, onto the review of this long, magnificent-until-the-filler-starts series. The animation of the show gets better by season, especially the opening sequence. The only qualm I have about the animation is the fighting sequences. More action, less stalemates, please. A stalemate is good now and then for a dramatic effect, but for nearly every fight starts to become tedious and boring. But I can work with it. It’s crisp and clear, and the designs of the scenery are refreshing because the structures of the villages are unique to their elemental area. Although the best designed character in my humble opinion has to be Temari and Shikamaru. Sure it is a bit of bias, but that’s only because those two are my favorite characters. Seriously, though. I like the thought of including a character such as Rock Lee to pay semi-homage to Bruce Lee. Although I don’t personally like the first opening song, it is a good theme for that season’s setting. The beat and rhythm of the song go well with the atmosphere, which is why it is a good pick by the Naruto crew. However I’ve listened to it too much and I don’t like it as much as when I had first heard it when I first started watching the show. I totally love the second opening song by my favorite J-Rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation. Again, it goes perfect with the atmosphere of the season and with the opening video animation. The third song is a good choice, however the singer is too high pitched to set the right mood of the song. It doesn’t mean I don’t like the song, though. I like it just fine. The singer is just too high pitched, is all. The rest of the songs are mostly J-Rock and their beats are very nice to follow. Fighting Dreamers, the fourth season opener is easy to sing along to, and that’s pretty nice. I won’t go into every single opener, so I’ll just move along to the actual soundtrack. The fighting music is good and gets you into the mood of the fight. Especially the fights Naruto participates in. That music theme is the most catchy that I have heard. But the most depressing fighting music is the theme that plays when the Hyuuga siblings duke it out in the Chuunin exams. It’s a touching match and the song really gets to you when you’re rooting for Hinata, or Neji, if you’re not fond of Hinata. Ah, the story. It is a magnificent story to follow a young ninja warrior’s adventures to becoming Hokage and fulfilling various missions with his group. The most compelling story is the Missing Nin arc featuring Haku and Zabuza. Ah, shounen-ai; Just kidding. These two had a really strong bond with one another except Zabuza didn’t realize it until it was too late. This arc is also the arc where we first see a glimpse of Kyubei Naruto in his first form. Although there isn’t much to say about the main story because the filler takes up most of the series. 135-215, Eesh. That’s a lot of filler. I do have to say that the first few seasons are worth purchasing, though not to purchase the fillers. Ah, the ever various and unique cast of Naruto. There is a character for everyone since the cast of Naruto is so vast; a character that eats a lot, to a lazy character who is a genius tactician. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite characters are Shikamaru and Temari, although Temari is from the Sand Village. One could get a lot of value from this series; especially rewatch value as it is a very long series of 220 episodes. Well, less if you skip the filler, which is highly recommended you do if you rewatch the series, unless you find a filler arc you enjoy, then more power to you. I enjoyed this series, although to be honest I haven’t completed the 220 as of now, I still have 15 to watch to complete this 220 episode anime.

"I laughed, i cried and i was excited. In other words there were everything in this anime what necessary to a long anime like Naruto :) As i was watching it i didn't feel that it was waste i watched such a long anime. I liked Naruto's character so much. Naruto is a freaky, dumb and unlucky person who was always outcasted by the people in the village. However later he became a careful, strong guy who passes everyone's expection and surprise them. He's been helped by his friends and he's able to move forward by their assistance. He thinks Sasuke as a friend during the whole time what they spend together in the Team 7 it's (maybe) because Sasuke is also lonely after he lost his parents. I've learnt a lot from this anime. The voice actors were great. Even though i was surprised that Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's voice still i think she is the best for Naruto. The opening and ending songs fitted to the anime very well. Especially the FLOW songs. I liked almost all of the soundtracks in it. I like its grafic. I suppose it's unique.

"Naruto was the first anime I ever watched. And I'm glad it was. Because if I had watched for example Death Note, I think I wouldn't still be watching anime. Why is that? Naruto isn't a 'hardcore' anime. It is just plain fun and everyone can understand the storyline. While some other animes may be confusing when you first watch them, Naruto is just clear. Very soon I realised what the power of Naruto was. It isn't the story, which is quite cool too, but it are the characters! Everyone has their own story and their own way of thinking. Their own powers and their own weaknesses. This isn't something new in an anime, but Naruto does it in such a great way! It is really touching when someone is about to die, and you feel really glad if one of the main characters won a battle. What too is a great thing, is the whole world. The town feels realistic, although it is in a fantasy world. What I mean is that everything just feels natural and right. All the ninja ranks and how people treat eachother, it feels like a real but different world. The enviroment is beautiful too and is perfect for the battles which will take place there. I have been very, very positive untill now. The negative aspect of Naruto is that there are a lot of fillers. Sometimes they are just plain fun, but I really got annoyed when I found out that the episodes 120 untill about 200 are all just fillers! I quit watching and started Naruto Shippuden without missing anything of the plot. I would recommend this to anyone one who loves action-based animes. It is fun and probably one of the most ass-kicking animes!",9,Recommended,"Jan 10, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da283ddaf7,1
"Hm... Naruto as a series is a difficult one to review. It's almost 'cool' and 'accepted' to say this mainstream anime is overhyped and cliche. If one were to gush about Naruto one would immediately jump to the conclusion that they are a child, naive, or just new to anime. Naruto is a story about a orphan kid who becomes a ninja. If you look at Naruto's story objectively it's actually pretty good. It has all the stuff you would likely want in a story; rivalries, fighting, ninjas, friendship, philosophical moralizing etc... What ultimately makes this shounen different from say a DBZ or a Bleach is that all these things are all woven better into the story making a better cohesive story. There aren't any real devastating plot twists that come from nowhere in Naruto. The most important things that happen are foreshadowed a good deal throughout. Each arc ultimately ties into the next unlike a DBZ and the degradation in story isnt as quick as a Bleach. The story is woven and complete (IMO) throughout the 100+ episodes. The characters in the show is another huge plus. Sure the titular character, Naruto, is irritating but the real strength here is the wealth of background characters in Naruto. Each of them through the series (manga related episodes) are given, for lack of better words, their time to shine. The themes related to each character also makes for interesting dialogue between them. Which brings me to dialogue which is another standout. The tone shifts quite abit through the 150ish episodes but the humor, dramatic scenes, or moralizing/psuedo-philosophical stuff all come off reasonably natural. Next the music is reasonably good. It has a nice feel to the music and it fits the scene pretty well. The theme 'Sadness and Sorrow' is a nice piece but tends to be overplayed in the dramatic places. By now you probably realized that I really liked Naruto, I watched it years ago but I still enjoy watching an episode here and there. I was a little discouraged when people my age were beginning to shut out Naruto for more 'edgier' animes. I dont think someone should put down Naruto because it's a kid show. Sure it's a little silly here and there but ultimately watching it makes a dam good time. I've watched a good share of animes but I have to say Naruto is still the most fun (doesn't mean its the best). Rejecting the things that were important in your youth seems almost natural but in this case it's unwarranted. Watch, enjoy. Rewatch, enjoy more. **This is a review of the ep1- the last manga arc of Naruto disregarding the fillers and Shippuden (which I have not seen- more proof that I'm not just a fanboy... maybe) **",9,Recommended,"Jan 25, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f712b12c3f,2
"First to say: I decided to write a review for one of my favorite animes even though there are more than enough reviews. My anime addiction is indebted to this series because this was the one that invited me to the otaku world... Story (7/10) Naruto's story revolved around a obnoxious kid named Naruto, if you don't like him, then it's not very likely that you'll love the series. The plot is a bit shallow and a bit of a cliche; a stupid main character who wants to attempt the impossible and has a hidden power behind his sadness having stereotypical nakamas to protect. Simply to say it is the journey of Naruto to become the best; however, he has to face conflicts within himself, with others and with the world as well. Don't expect psychology, deep philosophy, and thought provoking issues here because Naruto was made for the general audience and tackles drama within the character's personal lives as teenage ninjas, there are almost no societal issue here and war and politics are not a prominent figure. The story is about lives. The life of a ninja here is portrayed in a comedic and adventurous way in the eyes of mostly innocent youths who in time, will be able to learn about its darkness. But what made Naruto so lovable? It is the universe it created. The villages, the clans and the people's lifestyle are so fun to learn about, they are so fun to be in. Plot twists are plentiful and the characters' interactions are very exciting. But the heart of Naruto fandom is the ACTION; loved characters fighting with their well loved skills. Each of them has unique attributes coming from their bloodline or they developed personally. Most of the time, they think while they fight resulting into exciting clashes of logic and tactics. Their powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where their strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is ""who will win if..."" However, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless fillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden was a total disgrace. Overall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came. Art (7/10) The character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very detailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such as the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers. The houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired. Yet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn (especially at the fillers). Sound (8/10) What I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a ""ninja"" feel. Though not exceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your adrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated. But the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation. Character(7/10) This part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches: A boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower A rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone. A girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies Mostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic attributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the story is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. Naruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming. I also loved its concept of having a ""home""and to belong to and having a ""dream"" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here. HOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful unnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland. But Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the pureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of time. Angst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they are. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view. Naruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and audiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a ninja to become an inspiration to everybody. Enjoyment (9/10) I loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in watching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can extract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood... Naruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best in one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute? ""It's just popular but not really good."" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its flaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen. So heed my final words: exposure to this material may cause long term addiction OVERALL: 7/10",7,Recommended,"May 5, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ca9aa0e7d8,2
"Naruto is a hit and miss with some people. You can hate or appreciate; that's how it works. Most people say that Naruto is a pretty bad anime, and in reality, it's not. While there are obvious shortcomings and issues, there are also some really good parts in this anime that probably anyone would enjoy. Of course, what is Naruto, really? Well, it's a story about a boy named Uzumaki Naruto, whose dream is to become the Hokage, or, top ninja. This is an incredible feat, of course, and only some one extraordinary could achieve such a feat. However, he is different. Naruto's path is (and will) be very difficult, since an incident many years ago left him with a demon, the Kyuubi, sealed inside his body. The Kyuubi is a beast with exceptional power that nearly destroyed the Village of Konohagure, Naruto's village. His village disgraces him for his powers not because of the boy himself, but out of fear that the power will return one day. Naruto wants to prove the villagers wrong and become Hokage, and protect them. He will, of course, need special training in order to become so, and also the necessary training that all ninja trainees get in order to succeed. Will he? You will just have to watch. Now, what do I think about Naruto? Well, being a USA resident, I was first subjected to the dubbed version all those years ago. I had read The Shonen Jump pilot manga years ago, and with technology not being as advanced as now, watching subbed episodes without importing and learning Japanese was impossible, so I was subjected to watching the dubbed episodes. Of course, being a longtime anime fan, I was not impressed, compared to other anime's that I had watched prior (that were dubbed). My luck changed eventually, and subbing groups were formed and I had gotten what I wanted. The original, un-edited content and blood that the cut-dry dubbed version did not have. Alas, my opinion changed. I was left satisfied and it exceeded my expectations. Now, now. Naruto is not the greatest anime that I've ever seen. However, it does not suck. The character development goes at the speed you would expect it to, and Naruto does leave behind characters that you will remember (and ones that you will want to forget -- Sasuke, anyone?) The animation, amongst other things, is good, and battles in-depth (although it might take some time for the characters to move.. just to waste time, really). Now, the last part comes up to you. Naruto, like I said before, is a hit-or-miss. You either fall in love with the concept, or you hate it to the core. Personally, I don't. I like the ninja action and the plot development. You may not. That's the point - Naruto is what you make of it. It may be the best thing you ever see, or the worst. Now all you need to do is find out for yourself.",8,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7a6ef55c6d,2
"Naruto (not Naruto Shippuden) is awesome. It had a nice setting, character development, plot, and fighting scenes. The thing I enjoyed most about Naruto was its character development. The diverse array of characters in Naruto all (with the exception of Ten-ten and a few other people) had their spotlight and unique identities. I especially liked Naruto because he was the hard-working underdog. You also get these bad-ass fighting scenes. These fighting scenes, I felt, actually made sense. There weren't many nakama-power ups, and the good people didn't always win. Everyone was limited by chakra. You also get some cool strategies! I really enjoyed this series. And even though I don't continue Naruto with the manga or watch Shippuden, I still like to rewatch old Naruto episodes.",8,Recommended,"May 19, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_35348d1b4d,2
"Although Naruto is sometimes overexaggerated with the way it has somehow been &quot;stolen from other manga artists&quot; and it isn't creative. Naruto, although very simple character, has a great personality and proves that he is able to do anything so long as he sets his mind to it. With his friends and Konohagakure no Sato behind him, he sets his mind on becoming Hokage, the greatest ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village. That does not omit the fact that Naruto has other infamous characters that are loved. Uchiha Sasuke - the character that every girl seems to love (besides myself. Naruto fangirl here), and the somewhat antagonist of the story was meant to die at the beginning of the series. So far, he seems to always have a way of slipping through everyone's hands, and has a demeanor that just says to everyone he looks at, &quot;Back off.&quot; Haruno Sakura - the girl that has a major crush on Sasuke, who Naruto has a crush on, and with the undeniable passion to do what she wishes. Although considered the weakest of the Konoha 9, Sakura has a knack for chakra control, and Inner Sakura seems to give her a bit of a teenage look about her. What girl doesn't have her own inner self that screams out what she wishes to say? Hatake Kakashi - the man that leads the group. A jounin beyond his years, Kakashi helps Sasuke most of the time, but in the end realizes his mistake of not helping out Naruto at all. This leads to him wanting to keep everyone safe, so it helps a lot of people. I personally adore Naruto. It gives me an insight of what I could be if I were an anime character. That character would be Sakura, no doubt. In the end, though, Naruto does have its kinks to work out, but it will surely become a masterpiece that I wish for my children to look back on.

"Naruto (also referred to as ""Ninja Brokeback Mountain"") is an anime about sand ninjas and eugenics. It is a gateway anime of the worst kind riddled with one-dimensional characters who lack development, poor pacing, numerous plot holes, shitty villains who ""aren't really so bad in the end"", an anime saturated in filler arcs, a final arc with a complicated mess of a plot that stretched on for a year, massive use abuse of plot armor to cover up shitty writing, and a story of ""friendship"" which somehow makes Boku No Pico look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison. Despite this, it is one of /a/'s guilty pleasures due to being a massive lolcow which has provided them with lulz for 15 years. The story is about a blonde-haired, afro hairstyled, blue-eyed, half-emo, foreigner half-demon ninja teen struggling to be accepted into society by being a whiny fagget who annoys everyone around him, including the viewers. His goal is to become Hokage Ninja Obama and change the world. To accomplish this he becomes a ninja who dresses in bright colors, doesn't into stealth, announces his presence to his enemies, literally only uses 2 jutsus for the entirety of the series, forgives mass murderers, and rather than killing enemies would rather give gay speeches about bonds and friendship and other shit. In fact, He is such a failure of a ninja that the plot replaced him with Sasuke ""Edge-Lord"" Uchiha as the main character halfway through the story due to Kishimoto's boner for his favorite character. One of the many themes in Naruto that are ultimately ignored is that hard work surpasses talent which is shown in how Naruto and Sasuke become the most overpowered characters by having perfect bloodlines and literally being handed power ups while characters like Rock Lee are ultimately forgotten by the plot. Great writing there, Kishimoto! Another lesson Naruto teaches is that if you stalk someone long enough, they will change their mind about you and will run back into your arms. You're better off watching a rock than this show.",1,Not Recommended,"Apr 17, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4a1389e7b5,2
"Okay an honest review here truthfully this is one of my favorite anime, but there are things that i liked about the show and things that i hated about the anime. I enjoy the story, it starts of very simple but it gets deeper as you go on through the series, however it never explained why naruto dressed in orange. the art is amazing i love their style especially in the fighting scenes, i can see that they worked very hard on those scenes and i feel they did the anime some justice with they're art. The OST and the sound effects were awesome, it matched the Anime well, it made the fights more intense and also made a lot more scenes come to life. The Character all came in at the right time in the first season the main characters it focused on was Naruto, Saskue, Sakura, and Kakashi. Naruto was the most explained character, to be honest he was a terrible ninja in this series and should have died. Saskue is a very skilled ninja on the other hand and everyone likes him. Sakura, i can simply say i grew to hate her, as the story goes on she just makes everything worse. Kakashi is a mystery the whole time, you learn very little about him in this series. This anime is very enjoyable, but they are very repetitive with the flashbacks i don't mind flashbacks but if they keep repeating the same flashback that they showed a few episodes back it gets annoying, but the action keeps you in the show to be completely honest, the explanation of the abilities is also interesting some people hate it, but i like it, it's your opinion about that. also if you don't like filler after ep 135 go to 220 and skip the 1st half lol. overall i give it an 8/10 i personally think this show isn't overated its just people want others to see it.",8,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_376956031c,2

I'd recommend Mars of Destruction before this. Naruto seemed to have potential at a first go, oh maybe it's going somewhere! Then it doesn't. So much for the plot. The art, is decent. Not really good enough to wow me. The sound was decent as well, but nothing worth talking about. The characters are awful, with no depth to them at all.

"When people look at Naruto, they tend to look at it through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. And while that's fine, unfortunately, for someone who did not grow up with it, for someone whose major piece of media consumed was not Naruto, it mostly turns out to be just fine. The show starts off well - all the characters are shown to work towards a common goal, the goal of being a great shinobi. There are some pervy jokes thrown around here and there, but the story is mostly made to appeal to those who can relate to the childish aspect of the characters, the humour and the story. Many of the characters are likeable - Jiraiya and Kakashi are good mentors, Rock, Neji and Gaara are interesting characters, and Sasuke provides appeal in the form of a rival. The first arc is pretty good, though Naruto's declaration of becoming Hokage becomes really annoying and out of place real quick. The story of Zabuza and Haku, as well as their fight with Team 7, is pretty nice to watch. The Chunin Exam Arc, arguably, is the peak of the original Naruto anime : the arc is long, but each stage of the selection is fun to watch, as it provides compelling stories for each character involved, and the villain is interesting. Here is where the show starts cracking - fillers start to take over and backstories get repetitively shown. Naruto sitting on the swing with the sad music in the background became a meme for a reason after all. The Tsunade Arc is where this is seen a lot - many scenes are repeated constantly across the semi-long arc (and beware, these arcs get LONG). Many scenes are pretty imaginative, but, sadly, not all are interesting and add up to an uninspired child's imaginative stories. The same goes for the Sasuke Arc, which, while it had its moments with Itachi and the Uchiha Clan, was still pretty repetitive in its storytelling. Past that, everything till the end was filler, adding nothing to the story other than stretching it out for increased runtime and being almost unbearable. Characters like Sakura and Hinata were underused and poorly written, always relying on Naruto and Kakashi, among others, for help, but going back to acting rude to them or being absolutely detached. The art and animation was good, and while some of the fights were visually appealing, many early scenes were still shots. The music was treated much better, both in quality and usage. At the end of the day, Naruto is just a show made for children (put the pitchforks down fellas). Yes, some level of maturity is required to digest some of the plot points, but most of the show is made to appeal to predominantly younger audiences.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d904f4c708,2
"I used to think that naruto was an ok show. But then I realized there is no point in watching an anime that will NEVER END! Even after 220 episodes they still refuse to end it. Instead they make a sequel!And naruto is also the most annoying main character ever. after the 500th &quot;believe it!&quot; the catch phrase tends to get annoying. one of the most annoying parts of the show are the flash backs.it gets really annoying when they show flash backs about the time that character stole a piece of bread or something right in the middle of an epic battle. another thing that isn't really annoying but is kinda weird is that this show has head sets, giant televisions, stoves, cameras, etc but no cars or guns. just a little odd. so unless you have a thing for anime that doesn't have an ending, and has annoying characters this probably isn't an anime for you.",1,Not Recommended,"Jan 8, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2f16f1cb27,2
"I believe that Naruto is in fact, if not the most, one of the most overrated and overestimated animes I have seen. First of all, most characters seem very generic, and the some chracters (ESPECIALLY female) lack usefulness. Before you tell me I'm wrong, think about this: If YOU were to be watching a fight where your comrades and close friends may be fighting for their lives and chance to save yours, would YOU be there at the sides shouting their names and probably just distracting them, or would you stand up and fight along? Of course, at some point these certain characters did change. But it would have been much better to make them at least a little more gutsy now, and have them progress later. Actually I would've rated their character even lower if it weren't for their development. Then, we have the endless supply of fillers. (And so I pray, Unlimited Naruto filler works.) These fillers are episodes which have no real relation to the plot and are created for the sole reason of making the episode longer. Honestly, I think having some fillers are good, because if all episodes were following a plot, the series would go very fast. The fact that they introduce us to new characters doesn't change anything except if that character has a relation to the plot. So, at first glance based on people saying how great this is, you may be thinking 'Ah, this is a pretty good series!' But you then start watching it, then you get bored of the fillers and sick of the useless characters that don't seem to die. Personally, I actually would have continued with the next season if it wasn't for the fear of having to go through a whole bunch of fillers again.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 16, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_37ffb0ba1a,2
"Alright, so let me start off by saying, boy, was I a non-believer of Naruto! I remember watching it on YTV when I was like 12 or 13, and the only thing I remember was hating it. I even remember making fun of Narutards, but now, about 4-5 years later, am a Narutard myself. xD So I just want to say that if something's holding you back, ignore it and try it out! A good handful of episodes (20-30) should get you hooked on! After both Naruto and Naruto: Shippudden, I can confidently say that this is one of the best anime I've watched so far so I strongly recommend anyone to watch this series regardless of the genre you're interested in! So, let's get down to businessss: Sound: 10/10 Naruto had one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime (right behind Inuyasha that is!). I have felt all the emotions a human can possibly feel through the music itself. The fierce beating of the drums during the fights, soothing sound of the flute as Naruto reminisces about the past, upbeat instrumental as Pervy Sage sneaks a peek at the sexy ladies were a few of the many soundtracks that had me at the edge of my chair, crying, or at other times laughing 'till I fell off my chair! The sound in Naruto I found to be impeccable, and flawless, especially the OST. Art: 8/10 The art was good. Not amazing, I wouldn't say. But still pretty good. But if you're dissatisfied that there aren't that many hot guys ;) or girls, just wait 'till Shippudden! (Not to mention, another huge plus point is the yaoi/yuri fan-drawings you get to enjoy on DeviantArt or ZeroChan! ;) hehehe) But aside from the character drawings (which is still great!), the scenery were outstanding! My favourite colour is green, so I found the lush forests, and the soft paddy fields to be just absolutely breath-taking! The scenery really makes you want to live life in the edo period because it gives off the feeling that life is so relaxing! Story: 7.5/10 The story has a lot of potential (as you will see in Naruto: Shippudden), but unfortunately, there are a little too many filler episodes! But don't be discouraged because once you get addicted, you wouldn't care about the filler because the original plot is just too exciting! Besides, you can always skip the filler (search Google!). When you think it can't get any better, Naruto: Shippudden just surprises you with the improved pace! So, like I said, don't be discouraged if you think the pacing in Naruto is too slow and the plot isn't progressing, because in the next sequel, it really picks up! But apart from the warnings and ""bad things"", Naruto is a lot about friendship, and how they live life and fight against evil all while they stand beside their comrades. One thing for sure in Naruto, you know they've got each others' backs. Pardon the cheesyness but that's the main reason I like it so much! :3 Character: 9/10 The characters are really easy to love! And it's just amazing when they fight together to fight evilll. (haha, there it is again, the cheesyness within me). It's so easy to laugh along with, fall in love with (sasori x deidara ;)), and just admire these characters! Enjoyment: 9/10 I never thought after completing Avatar the Last Airbender that I'd fall in love with a show again, but here it is, Naruto! I really enjoyed it! Throughout the whole time I was experiencing so many emotions - anger, happiness, fear, jealousy (Sasori! ;)), and depression. Naruto's up there on my list ;) (though Shippudden's higher ;D) Overall: 8.5/10 Overall, it was a really enjoyable show and I'd recommend it to anyone especially if you'd like a series where you can get attached to the characters (a longer one rather than the short 12 or 26 episodic animes). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do and send me a message if you decide to try it out and how it goes with you! ;) For now, I shall bid you adieu and get on to One Piece (hehe, my new addiction...) -uhh, call me Blaze.

"As a big anime fan, i watched many different animes, maybe not as much as most people, but still enough to find what i liked and disliked, and Naruto is definately not in those choces of in between, it,s plain flat hatred, at first i was obsessed with the anime, and now i do NOT understand why... seriousely... it,s really disapointing, Naruto is the most viewed and probably the most loved shounen manga/animes ever.... i seriousely don't get why people are so hooked on it, it's clichéd and overused Story: 1 A kid who's parents died (right there, cliché) when she was a baby (cliché) has the dream to become the leader of his village (cliché) and has a crush on a girl (cloché) who hates him and likes another guy (cliché) who is way cooler (cliché), those three end up in the same team (cliché) with a teacher who wants to unite them better (cliché).... That's the basic story, alot of things happen obviousely, but i just can't find anything that really ATTRACTS me to the story well.. and i,m a huge fan of shounen, many of my friends don,t even believe i'm a girl because of that, so i have a pretty good eye to compare, and when i compare between this anime and another shorter/better story, i would definately pick another anime... the story is too long and too boring after a while, many of my friends stopped reading/watching it because it took too long, they simply don't care about the end anymore. Art: 8 Art was pretty good, that was one thing i didn't hate about the anime, it's pretty basic and simple to draw, and it's also easier to imitate drawing characters like those, but i can't give the art a 10, because it was too simple, sure most people will tell me what the hell i'm talking about since art isn't what matters most, i know that, but i'm trying to look for reasons to not give this anime a 0, catch my drift?

"Overview: Naruto has been going strong for 15 years now and is one of the most popular anime in the world. What exactly does this series do so well to gain such a massive fandom? Let's jump through some poorly animated trees and into a world where stealth assassins wear bright orange jump suits! This is Naruto! Story: 6/10 Naruto takes place in a world where ninjas are extremely common and perform many tasks: messengers, body guards, assassins, scientists, and even national leaders. The ninjas in this show don't actually conform to the stereotypes portrayed in cinema. In fact, they are often so far removed from everything associated with ninja that they may as well just be called mutants or super heroes. What the hell does telepathically controlling sand have to do with being a ninja? I played Tenchu on the PS1 and I sure as hell wasn't killing people with fucking sand! Anyways, the plot follows the hyperactive, rambunctious, yet highly ambitious Naruto Uzumaki and his goal to become leader of his ninja village. Naruto has lived as an outcast his entire life because he has a demonic 9 tailed fox sealed inside him by his father. His father did this in order to stop the rampaging 9 tails from destroying the village and it ended up costing him his life. Naruto must use his powers to slowly win the trust and respect of his village and his fellow ninja team mates. The beginning of the series features a lot of training and tedious explanation of ""chakra"" and other concepts of the Naruto world. The story actually starts getting interesting when Naruto must take a special test called the Chuunin exam in order to gain a higher rank and go on more dangerous missions. I won't attempt to explain 15 years of plot in this small review, but trust me that the plot goes on FAR longer than necessary. Kishimoto keeps creating new enemies in order to drag it on longer and longer. Just when the latest big bad is defeated, we get to hear a sob story and learn that big bad #120 was actually being controlled by big bad #121, who it will turn out is merely a puppet in the schemes of #122. The plot is also bogged down by god awful filler that ranks among the worst shonen filler EVER! Ok, well not as bad as Inuyasha's filler, but still bad. Character: 6/10 Naruto has a LOT of characters, some of whom are interesting and fun to watch and some of whom are an absolute pain in the ass. Unfortunately, Naruto is one of least interesting characters in the whole series. He redefines what it means to be a generic shonen hero cliche'. Sasuke spends the vast majority of the series being a whiny little twat that you just want to bitch slap. Sakura's affection for Sasuke seems extremely misplaced and she doesn't do anything useful until Shippuden starts...after episode 220. Hinata is actually one of the interesting characters. Like Shinji from Evangelion, she is the socially awkward, overwhelmed, nervous wreck that the otaku at home will probably most identify with. I'm certainly a LOT more Hinata than I am Naruto and I am willing to wager that so is nearly everyone else. Her struggles aren't so much about taking down impossibly strong villains, but learning how to express her feelings and get over her introversion and social anxiety. The real world nature of these problems make them infinitely more identifiable for the viewer. One of my other favorites is Gaara, who starts out as a lonely yet psychopathic ninja that brutally murders everyone that crosses his path. However, the show actually tries to make him sympathetic and largely succeeds. We get to see him slowly redeem himself and even become his country's leader. Apparently if you are strong in this world, your countless murders of innocent people are simply waved away and you can get selected to lead a nation. Hell yeah! Lucy/Gaara 2016! My other favorite characters include the absolute badass Itachi and pretentious artist Deidara. Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack features many memorable openings and closings along with kickass instrumentals to pump up the fight scenes. Naruto also has just the right music to make tragic scenes moving and happy scenes more fun. It isn't the perfect anime soundtrack, but it is solid throughout. Art: 6/10 The art isn't the greatest ever, but it isn't bad. You also have to consider the budgetary constraints of having a 500+ episode series when you groan at the use of poorly animated 3 second loops of characters jumping through trees. God damn Sasuke retrieval arc! Enjoyment: 3/10 In Heart of Darkness we are left with the famous last utterance of Kurtz, ""the horror, the horror!"" In Naruto this would be ""The filler...the filler!"" Seriously, the awful filler content along with the tedious explanations whenever anyone uses any technique, make this series often painful to watch. I recommend the far superior manga. Overall: 6/10 Naruto has some things that it admittedly does quite well, along with a substantial list of flaws. I would ultimately say that it is a very average series. It is a good introduction to anime for the uninitiated, but there are honestly far better anime out there. There is also far, far worse. I'm not going to be the anime snob that tells young teens that Naruto is the single worst anime ever created. That would be a complete lie. I've sat through Ikki Tousen, Najika Blitz Tactics and Seikon no Qwasar, so I know what I'm fucking talking about.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 27, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_723f4f0ee1,2
"NARUTARDS BEWARE Let me start off by saying that I, like many others, watch this show immediately after very popular anime like Dragon ball z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Trigun, so I thought that this show was great, though some things always stuck out in my mind. That being said, let me move on to this, Naruto TANKED, FAILED, SUCKED, WOMPED, AND ALL AROUND NOT GOOD after the Rock Lee vs Garra fight, (around ep 50 ish)although looking back it was not that great before that. Story: Very mediocre, &quot;I want to be the ______ strongest and best ________ so that everyone will ________!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Seen it all before, he wants people to notice him because he didn't have any friends and has a demon fox inside of him that he conveniently didn't began to use until the beginning of the series. Now I would like to digress to a few things that I notice, First Naruto claims that nobody talked/acknowledged him but then he is shown eating with Choji, sleeping with kiba, and running from the hokage? with Shikamaru when they were all younger, now I no expert but that sounds like friends to me. Second is on the first episode, a YOUNG, UNTRAINED NINJA WANNABE and a mediocre older ninja managed to steal a highly &quot;important&quot; scroll that teaches someone something that alot of people already know (shadow clone). anyway, the story suck because usually when someone says they are going to do something (especially when it's so close to there reach) they do it, Naruto it no closer to become Hokage than he was 200+ episodes ago. LOL I don't even need to talk about the fillers since its been killed and rekilled. Art: Everyone says its so great but has anyone else noticed that in at least 2 fights (team 7 vs girl Orochimaru and Sasuke vs Naruto) the animation changed drastically in the middle of the fight...........'nuf said. Sound: No real complaints other than, that music gets annoying after a while, I mean the HUH one, and some of the VA's are annoying. Character: Oh yes, now first SOME OF THE CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE PASTS!!!!!!!!!! yea I suppose people like Shino and Ten Ten had absolutely nothing of importance happen to them, and while on the subject of Ten Ten, the author of Naruto HIMSELF said the Ten Ten iss just a FILLER character, acting only to fill in the place of the female character in Guys team..........what type of crap is the a filler main character, also there are no character (outside of filler) interactions, I'd like to see Lee and Hinata have a conversation, I'd like to see Kiba and Neji chat it up. Naruto is just plan annoying his attitude changes to much, one minute he's destroying the villages monument and the next he's risking his life for one dude, and what's up with this I will get Sasuke back no matter what it so annoying, has he given up on being Hokage? The saving graces of the characters are Kakashi, Shikamaru, and a few others that they almost never show. One more thing the characters almost never change, Kiba has been the same( from what they've shown) since the beginning so has Sasuke, Sakura, Lee, ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS etc, etc Enjoyment: like I said, at first I enjoyed it, then it just starting getting.........Awful. Overall: A good started anime, but for people who have seen things other than Digimon, Pokemon, Dbz, anything on Adult swim, and Sailor moon, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!!",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_38c952fbbf,2
"Style - It's ok. Some parts (e.g Lee vs Gaara fight) are decent, other parts are not so great. 2 out of 3. Character - The main flaw with Naruto characters is that they are clinically retarded. Ninjas are supposed to be stealthy, right? There wasn't a single stealthy ninja in the whole of naruto. Naruto wears a orange jumpsuit, Sakura wears red, Sasuke wears blue, the Akatsuki wear black cloaks with red clouds and everyone wears a shiny light-reflecting ""forehead protector"". Sure is stealthy. You see, normal people tend to avoid fighting for no good reason as it means getting hurt, noticed, and arrested. Naruto characters on the other hand start fights for no reason at all other than to bolster their incredibly fragile egos. Naruto is an impulsive idiot. Sasuke is an arrogant asshole. Sakura is useless. In addition, all of the characters are immature, naive, and lazy. Oh yeah, did I mention the fact that Naruto charges headlong into every fight, breaking formation and getting his ass kicked, every single time? He must have brain damage from getting beaten up so often. 0 out of 4. Story - The story of Naruto is complete nonsense. Throwing knives are crap as ranged weapons. It'd be easier to just sneak up on someone and stab them with it. Why does nobody use a bow and arrow in Naruto? They already have computer screens. The original Eastern concept of chakra was taken by Naruto and made into magic points that allow you to break the laws of physics. Naruto originally wanted to be a hokage. Now he's more interested in retrieving Sasuke. Okay let's go through the plot. First there was the Zabuza mission, where I thought they should have died. Zabuza alone could have taken all of them out but he wasted too much time chatting around. Then there's Haku, who was about to kill both Naruto and Sasuke when suddenly Naruto's 9-tailed fox guardian came out of nowhere and saved the day. This then happens every single time Naruto is in trouble - the 9 tailed fox saves the day. It gets repetitive and sends all the wrong messages to the kids (no hard work needed, just call the 9 tailed fox!!). Also, how Naruto defeated Kiba in the preliminary exam was just incredibly stupid, needless to say shitting your pants wouldn't save you from someone determined to beat the shit out of you in real life. Oh yeah and Naruto gives speeches that instantly turns villains into good guys. 0 out of 3. Overall 2 out of 10 for retarded characters and nonsensical plot.",2,Not Recommended,"Apr 21, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_83160511cc,2
"This review is from my personal assessment of episodes 1 to 135, inclusive, of the Naruto series. I will try to do something interesting in this review, and that is to review the anime at the time it was aired and touch on its impact on me at the time it was aired. If there were ever a series that had vastly extreme views, it would have to be this one. And thus, this is why I had to review it, to contribute my thoughts into this sensitive subject. What is Naruto? It is an action series that appeared out of nowhere that, in my opinion, along with Bleach, defined the action/adventure/drama genre. By saying that a series defined a genre, it does not mean that series is the best from that genre. It merely means that the series, at that time, came out and boosted the enjoyment and popularity of that genre, also becoming one of the most popular of that genre. That series will be compared to when people talk of the genre, and newer series of the same genre will aim to surpass it. That is, by my definition, what is means to define a genre. Story: 7/10 From the moment it came out I was hooked. The story was catchy, and the action was already present in the first episode. What really impressed me was the second episode, which introduced a very common sub-genre into the action genre, and that is comedy. The pacing of the series was good, the suspense was there, the comedy was there, and there was this yearning to find out more about all the other ninjutsu and fighting styles that were also there. The plot, in itself, was pretty bad and didn't make a lot of sense to me. Basically, each ninja is supposed to find &quot;their way of being a ninja&quot; and by doing so, many of them broke the rules for being a ninja. By being a ninja, one has to put their mission above all of their emotions, but the series is completely based on themes of loneliness, sadness, friendship, and all this stuff that's about emotions. However, this was what I analyzed after looking back at the series. Back then, the plot was good enough for me to keep my interest in it; therefore, I gave it an overall seven. Art: 8/10 The action scenes are quite cool back then since it was really some of the most impressive action sequences that I have ever seen. The art, not animation, was just mediocre. Nothing really stands out, and while the ninjas &quot;teleporting&quot; from place to place looks cool, it is really just easier to animate. I will argue that the lack of artistic involvement does not affect my enjoyment of the series significant, and from a director's point of view, a long series such as this cannot afford to spent much more time on art. Sound: 10/10 The background music was what blew me away. Sometimes it is soothing and sad, other times it is cheery, and during action scenes, it is catchy and fun. Without Naruto's famous background music scores, the quality of the series would really go down drastically, since hearing is one of the senses that is necessary to draw someone completely into a series. Naruto did just that, so I will give Toshiro Masuda, the composer for the Naruto scores, my highest regards. Character: 7/10 Looking at each character at a time, they all have great development. Of course, everyone's favorite is Haku, and it is for a very good reason. I still think that Haku's &quot;arc&quot; is the best arc of Naruto, simply because of the huge amount of emotions that the arc conveys. Naruto, Sasuke, and Gaara all have their own sad pasts, and it is common for the characters' actions to be driven by events that happened to them in the past. This, in a sense, unifies the plot and shows mastery of character development. After all, the past, present, and future plays a huge role of &quot;their way of ninja.&quot; There is one flaw when you look at the overall picture, however. All of the main characters seem to suffer from the same sad and bitter past, which gets repetitive after a while. Enjoyment: 10/10 After all of this criticism, I just plainly and inexplicably enjoyed the series. Naruto is one series where equations don't work out and analyses fail. I can find so many flaws about it, but yet, it is just so damn enjoyable. There were many memorable scenes, such as Haku's loyalty and Sakura's feelings. Anime can be watched, enjoyed, and tossed away, but the ones that create vivid memories are the ones that you enjoy the most. Overall: 7/10 Remember that I am only reviewing this anime up to episode 135, so fillers are not included. I personally think that the fillers ruined the anime, and they were such a drastic failure that we forgot about the time when Naruto was enjoyable. Yes, I think that Naruto is just a mediocre series now and not as good as it used to be. However, I will never forget the amount of enjoyment this series have given me, and I will give it a fair rating on how much it meant to me. Naruto was part of my early anime experience, and it was one of the reasons why I am such an anime fan today. I owe a lot to this series, and even though it might not be great now, it is a series I will always remember.",7,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f0c1c56f28,2
"Okay. Well, at first, I saw my brother watching this series. At first I was like &quot;what is this series?&quot; Then I heard about this Naruto thing. So I decided to check it. I read the biograpy and was amazed of the plot. I'm not really a fan of action. But this series is not only about fighting. You will not like Naruto if you don't know the real story of it. Some of my classmates are saying that &quot;Naruto sucks!&quot; And I'm just saying that &quot;You just don't know the story. That's why you hate it.&quot; Each of the characters has their own talents, dreams, and sad pasts. Especially Naruto, Gaara, and Sasuke. Sometimes I'm annoyed that there are tons of characters in the story. I gave all 10 because the story is great, especially the art. All of the characters has unique looks. Character, all of them has a story and has their own dreams, it made me inspired. Enjoyment, sometimes my mother would ask me if I'm crazy or something.

"Many first-timers love this anime and some experienced anime fans give this anime a poor score. However, this anime appeals to a wide range of teenagers for its classic shounen and comedy with slight romance. ______________________________________________________________ Story: 9/10 The only reason the story is only 9 is because of the stupid fillers from 140-220. If those weren't there this would definitely receive a 10. They aren't bad but sometimes it seems repetitive and you just want the story to move on. The story starts out with Naruto causing mischief again, but as the story progresses he becomes a little more mature. My favorite part of the story is how Naruto has to prove to society that he is capable of being hogake, the best ninja in the village. ______________________________________________________________ Art: 10/10 The art is great. The ninja moves they are all very detailed and has a good design. The character design is also very balanced. ______________________________________________________________ Sound: 10/10 The background music(bgm) is just amazing. I mean seriously, they fit perfectly with the atmosphere and enhance the scene. The opening songs are great and my favorite one is the last one, ""Yura Yura"" by Hearts Grow. Its been almost a year since I first heard that song and I am still addicted to it. The ending songs are also good because of the slow emotional feeling. ______________________________________________________________ Character: 10/10 It may not seem like a 10 in the beginning, but trust me after a while the characters get to be one of its best aspects. The three main characters all have different personalities and they change as the story goes. The supporting characters are great because they're not just forgotten about and actually play a part in the story. ______________________________________________________________ Enjoyment: 9/10 It is a great anime for fans of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The reason that I enjoyed it was because the way Naruto never gives up was just inspiring to me. ______________________________________________________________ Overall: 9/10 This will always be one of the best anime I have ever watched, and I highly recommend you to try it.

"This is one of the most over rated animes ever, i may say that this review is abit biased seeing as ive watched only 2 episodes in a row, but through friends ive watched well over 30 of tid bits of episodes. But i remain uncertain of why this anime is so good. To me its only a good &quot;cartoon&quot; not anime. For only non full anime fans watch this who don't know what a good anime REALY is. and comparing this to other animes its TERRIBLE. Nothing good can be said about naruto in my eyes. The japanes voices are so kiddy and terrible acting and little good for the bubs. The story jsut DRAGS N' DRAGS. Although the characters i can say some what of good about there &quot;coolitude&quot; and the art is rather good. It's bright and creative and creates a somewhat decent atompshere in each scenerio. But this is not a good anime and i dont recomend watching it. if i was to recomend a good starter anime, I WOULD NVER SAY NARUTO. I would recomend either Gintama or Bleach. They both have a fantastic comeical side and serious fighting side. if u dont watch niether of them still avoid THIS RUBBISH and instead watch Inuyasha OR on a logn shot Yu-gi-oh x",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 27, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9d9675cb43,2
"I have not done a review in awhile and the reason for doing a review on such a popular anime is that I've checked a lot of random peoples profile to get anime inspiration as well as to compare and only about 40% had seen Naruto!!! This is not including those that dropped it or put it on hold etc. but how does one not attempt to watch it?! Obv. it is not for all people but here's my review anyway. Story- It's your classic underdog story that a lot of people can relate with. Let's face it, people in America can be very cruel to others that openly express their love for anything unorthodox. This is a anime full of struggle and perseverance, the message is so clear and motivating it's just as motivating after watching one of the Rocky movies (If for some reason you don't like Rocky make another analogy for something that pumps you up and it's equivalent to Naruto). The comedy is pretty good and they do not repeat the same jokes so that is a blessing. Why wasn't this a 10? Well I will tell you that the huge problem with this and its sequel is the damn FILLER! The filler is pretty awful not gonna lie. Trust me when I say do not quit the show because of it; worst comes to worst google where the filler ends and start from that ep. and skip all the filler; it's more enjoyable that way. Art- The art is good, not great. The fights, characters, justu and all the other effects look cool but in the original Naruto it's much less crisp. The colors are not as powerful as they could be and maybe it gives it a cool vintage feel but this is all about preference. Sound- This deserves a freakin 10! The soundtrack is easily something you can download to your i-pod it's so catchy. Every opening is great. I do not know why but I really do not listen to a lot of enjoyable ending songs, honestly I can think out of all the anime I have seen I only enjoy 4 ending songs. This show doesn't have great endings. That is not why I did not rate it a 10; it is because of the Dub. I have seen this show with both languages and lemme tell ya, the Dub gets very obnoxious. Sub is the way to go. Character- This show has more development than a teenager. Important people can die remember that it is not all sunshine and rainbows. The heroes you will love and the villains are beyond dark and evil and you will love to hate them. Enough said... Overall a nostalgic, easily rewatchable funny action packed anime. If you haven't seen it please do yourself a favor and watch it. Skip the filler and enjoy the fun ride Naruto will take you on.

The whole show is great especially for kids ranged 10+ up and it sets out the whole &quot;never give up on your dreams&quot; attitude there are some humor around it sometimes, but it still forced striaght to the main part of the story. Whatever you liked reading it, watch the anime version from Viz or in it's original dub it's still a good show to watch. Although I quite suggest not to watch the filter arc when toonami shows them.

"First off: The fillers are definately not worth watching ( probably the only exception is ep101 or 105, can't remember which, where Naruto and crew tried to get Kakashi to reveal what's under his mask). They are just random episodes made out of the blue, and contain no storyline whatsoever ( unlike the Bount Arc). Story up to the end of ...: This part of Naruto got me glued to my monitor. The plot rapidly unfolds in this arc, and new characters rapidly intoduced. Lots of wonderful fighting scenes, with little or no character. Very good. After the aforementioned arc to beginning of filler season: here characters are explored to more detail, also the plot is made more complex. Some good action scenes here, of course the best one being the fight between X and X. However, after this point, the plot deteriorates, it became dull and generic.Humours are used in an attempt to maintain audience attention, but became predictable as the story goes. Overall: There are many shorter, more interesting series out there with the same genre.

"Characters/Development Although the beginning of the story may not give much of an impression and suggest the characters are going to be having childish adventures together. The series is actually much different than expected which does get interesting the further the story develops. Of course to be expected there are many fight sequences adding a lot of action to the series, but more on that later. Throughout Naruto there are many different story arcs which usually link together explaining the plot more in depth filling some holes, teaching us pieces of the past or developing certain characters more. The series however does tend to drag on a lot for each episode or fight sequences which may take a while to conclude. Many flashbacks are also included which take two different approaches. One that develop the character or explain an event either briefly or in depth. One that are to remind the audience of previous episodes, sometimes even during the early moments of an episode. The latter tend to get boring and eventually rather annoying. Added into the mix of things are a few emotional moments for characters and some comedy which might give a chuckle but nothing too hilarious except one or two events. The characters in this series are rather unique in several ways. They each have their very own skills, ambitions and views upon certain matters. Most of the characters are focused on the younger generation, while there are still plenty of the older generation to experience, creating a large collection of likable or dislikeable characters. To pick a few, we have Naruto who appears to be quite dumb in understanding things, but has a good heart and knows how to get out of sticky situations during combat. His views can be quite mature for his age and the audience may sympathise with him at times. Then we have Sasuke who is the quiet vengeful type, of whom is seeking to kill his brother and the revival of his clan. Although having a dark atmosphere around him he can worry about his team and even become jealous of Naruto. We than have Sakura who appears to be a sweet girl, having her heart set on Sasuke, yet she can get in some bad tempers and show her other personality. Finally you have Kakashi, the team leader of the three, of adult age, who can be quite a likable character. He loves reading romance themed books of a certain series and is constantly later when meeting up with the team. Throughout the series, the skills and ways of each character is reflected in one way or another so we can learn the way they are like on the battlefield or within a group. The combat is a little different than expected at a slower pace and being tactical rather than having much physical contact. Lots of thrown weapons are used, or types of hand seals, which can either, improve an aspect of themselves or use as a form of attack in battle. Most fights can get quite violent with some bloody scenes here and there. Problems with these fight sequences most noticable are the fact the characters involved talk too much. It can be interesting to learn how they pulled of a certain strategy, or what their attacks actually do to their opponents or surroundings. Another problem are the flashbacks, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense when characters are facing against an enemy. Yet another problem is the constant usage of the same move from time to time which did get rather boring as well. Most fights during the series are conflicts that take place during the storyline while others tend to show the characters skills off a little, such as the Chuunin exam, which they take to become middle rank ninja. The series may take its story arcs at a slow pace but it eventually concludes the first main part of the story in 135 episodes, while the rest are filler episodes, which can be watched optionally as, they don&rsquo;t develop the story any further. I never did watch them. Animation/Scenery Art and animation improve over time and also seem to be done differently at certain points in the series. Firstly the animation starts off quite dull in the beginning episodes but quickly picks up from there. Most simple actions are done in a simple manner, but most noticeable difference are during the fight sequences, which can take two different approaches towards them which I&rsquo;ll explain a little later. There are quite a lot of still shots throughout either type of scene to possibly lengthen the episodes on helping to drag the series on a little longer. There are a few moments where the animation can get awkward from time to time. Effects for the techniques and powers seem to have been done fairly well too. The two types of combat animation is best explained by using the words, slow and fast which now should be fairly obvious. During the slow combat situations, they contain a lot of talking and quick attacks or moves here and there being rather paced and tactical while the level of detail in each scene is still there. It is quite the opposite for the faster paced combat, more directed towards the physicals sides of fighting through punching and kicking. The scenes are much more quicker paced yet the level of detail is lower than normal for both the scenes and characters, yet more interactiveness to the environment around them. Character designs overall can have a similar look to each other resorting to uses of different facial or clothing accessories. However, they are quite unique and fairly recognisable between them, while remaining well drawn. The best noticeable ways of making some characters stand out are these examples; The head guard covering Kakashi&rsquo;s left eye, Lee&rsquo;s large eyes and fuzzy eyebrows, while being nicknamed by Naruto for having so and Shiino&rsquo;s sunglasses, with the top of his coat masking most of his face. Most of the lesser characters such as guards have a rather simple look between them. This also helps these characters stand out quite well from the rest making them interesting, especially once you learn more about them in the series. Art wise, the series uses a lot of soft, bright tones for the characters and objects while being slightly saturated looking for the scenery. During the first few episodes the art seemed quite dull, but again quickly improves like everything else, getting sharper and visually more appealing. The scenery is also made quite well using consistent blends of colour and schemes. The village of Konoha uses a lot of brighter colours such as reds and greens to detail the locations. While for the hidden village of sand uses many yellows and yellowish looking cream colours. The makes the locations also unique in appearance just like the characters. Fights take place in different types of locations instead of barren landscapes, and vary between them during the series such as woodlands, bridges and canopy of trees to name a few depending on the situation. Audio/Music There are quite a lot of sound effects and music that create a nice set and compile together pretty well during either of the scenes where used. The contact of thrown weapons on wood, flesh or material is used correctly as well as the other sounds being timed right, no major complaints in this area. These sounds eventually become much more common and easy to recognise after a several episodes or less. Music is a nice highlight to the series, quite unique in tune mixing a bit of modern or rock with old style or chants. Each track has its one touch, being used well throughout the series during the correct scenes. These also become common and quite enjoyable where I&rsquo;ve found myself tapping my feet to them as they start up. New tracks are introduced as the series progresses and some can make certain scenes much more exciting to watch, emotional of funnier depending on the scene again. Never had a problem with the voice actors, but found the mysterious or evil characters fit their role, being reflected towards the audience well. Conclusion An interesting series that isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there, which can be either liked or hated. Many characters and action sequences which are usually approached well although the series does tend ot drag on, while being combined with good sound and music throughout. Enjoyable watch putting the slow pace aside, yet an over rated series.",7,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2007",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c595c89cc6,3

Well the more experienced anime viewers are going to give reviews of probly 5 and lower while the beginers are going to say it was outstanding and naruto is just one of those animes where you hate it or love it. Naruto is a big anime for kids and alot of anime biginers watch this anime because its so huge in the anime world that they think why not? so i am going to give this review all ive got. ~Story~ Well what can you say The plot is accually pretty fair and original on the basis of ninjas hokage ect. but i think it dragged on far too long with hundreds of episodes and its still not over its alot like one piece and bleach in that it just wont seem to end the start of naruto is great untill you get about half through the original series and it just gets boring and pointless and then with shippuden it goes good and then bad again but we will stick to the original naruto. I found that the series is alot of fillers and no real plot line other than alot of ahem sakura screaming sasuke but thats not really the point lol. ~Characters~ One word: Dull.....The characters grow sure but they dont really seem to well its hard to explain ill say it an easier way. The characters are idiots because all they focase on is find sasuke oh he killed aton of people oh well lets find him anyway its like a huge game of tag in this anime they chase sasuke he chases them over and over again its dull and boring. ~Overall~ To new people to anime watch this but to experienced people in the anime community dont bother you wont be missing much other than alot of screaming. =\ 5/10,5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 14, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1fcbab4ff4,3
"Story- Well if you haven't already seen at least an episode or two of this show online,on tv,or you live in a box then let me give you a little bit of the main story to this great anime. In the beggining the show starts of with a sort of flashback of the ninja leaf village. You see that there is a terrible demon that is attacking the village. The narrator will go on to tell you that the hokage of the village sealed the spirit of the fox demon in a little boy, and this boy is Naruto. After that it will start in the modern time of the story. Naruto will go on to make many friends in the ninja academy and go on many adventure through out this anime as this show is a 220 episode series with many story arcs. From episode 135 to 220 though there are filler episodes(episodes that are not original to the manga) created because the author could not start on working on the next story of this show because the anime episodes were catching up to the releases of the manga. Anyway you will notice as the story goes on the development of the characters and their maturity. Characters- Naruto- He's a imature at the beggining but becomes more serious when his friends or comrades are in danger. Sasuke- His style is to be considered as emo due to him being in an almost always depressed laid back sort of mood. (Will you learn more about later in the series about his family etc.) Sakura- She's kind of annoying to most people that watch this show because of her weakness in the beggining of the show and her complaining and competiveness to win Sasukes heart. Kakashi- A very quiet teacher to the squad but you will learn more about his background in the series. He's very strong and protective though. Animation Quality- The animation quality of this show is not very high mainly for the reason being that this is quite a long show and was aired weekly. Pros- This anime has a very addictive story line and characters as well as good morals at times. The fighting is pretty good and is overall a very entertaining anime. It also has some funny humor at times. Cons- This anime does not have the best animation quality and the story line is a little predictable at times. But you do have to remember that this is an anime more for a younger audience.",9,Recommended,"May 18, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_aecedbe030,3
well naruto is a very interesting anime its about a young idiotic persevering little boy. he causes a lot of trouble and he wants to become the greatest hokage. naruto has the 9 tailed fox spirit in him that almost destroyed the hidden leaf village. naruto likes to succede but he is still too weak. naruto's catch phrase is BELIEVE IT!!! he says that when anyone does not believe in him. naruto is truly an amazing anime. the reason i like naruto is because it was my first anime. naruto gave me the courage to try new animes. so i would give this anime 5 stars.,10,Recommended,"Jun 21, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_5d0cecc3e5,3
"This anime....well it is something else. I enjoyed watching every episode. The music was so upbeat and keeps an audience hooked. Every episode, I was either on the edge of my seat in suspense, or I was on the floor laughing. This anime incoorporates humor and all seriousness in one. This is definaltly an anime that I will remember forever. The characters are very different and the viewers can find a way to relate to at least one of them. (Sasuke and I for example.) The plot is very well thought out. The only thing that I hated about this anime was the fillers. They didn't need to add them. It ruined the plot. And it was going so well... I seriously recommend this for anyone who is into suspense, action, doesn't mind a little blood, drama, romance (a little..) and comedy.

"Premise: Fictional feudal-style Japan, where the Ninjas roam wearing cool SWAT costumes. Besides that, they also have Dragon Ball style ""chi"". Character: There's only 3 characters you need to know: Naruto - The main character (hence the anime title) who is a mediocre ninja if not for the hidden demon inside him. Sakura - A useless girl who serves no purpose in this anime, a liability who always got in the way of other people. Sasuke - An emo boy who thinks he's the center of the world. Relationships: Naruto has a crush on Sakura because he thinks she's cute, even though she's a b*tch to him. Sakura is obsessed on Sasuke because she likes the typical bad boy type. Sasuke thinks Naruto is his rival and get pissed when Naruto is stronger than him. But actually Sasuke is just confused by his love for Naruto. Plot: Fight, fight, fight, training.

"I love Naruto for being funny, inspirational, action packed, and tragic at the same time. Each story arc protrays different characters, with tragic pasts and how their lives change. Overall storyline itself is fantabulous. Character developement is also awesome. To be honest, one of the characters has helped me understand myself littel better now. Some of the themes (Orochimaru's theme, etc) are awesome and the art is good too. Since it is shounen, so you also have lot of action, which is top notch as well. The only disappointing aspects of the series might be its' speed at which it covers the manga and the fillers.

First those who haven't seen should be aware of is that this anime has a LARGE amount of filler and by LARGE amount I mean a LARGE amount. It felt like the author stopped caring half way through.The story starts off awesome, however becomes very very weak the only reason I'm giving it a 5 is for the action and a few touching moments. This anime by no means deserves anything above a 6-7 IF that. If you are looking for great story and action I would highly recommend One Piece.

"the modern day prototypical shonen anime, it exemplifies what shonen is all about with a young hero and his friends, including lots of action and humor. I really enjoyed watching this, I gave it an 8 for story when it actually was sticking to the main story line, I didn't count the filler episodes, which i admit make up pretty much the second half of the entire series, but even the fillers brought some good chuckles for me, and a couple of action gems. The art was pretty good, and I'll say that look forward to a very important fight, where the animation takes two steps up. The sound or music I assume was pretty good, and the OP and ED of the anime were fun to listen to, especially Haruka Kanata (OP2). The characters are awesome, some of my favorites are in this anime, although some may dislike Sakura...

"Naruto! Oh wow! This is the BEST anime I had ever seen! I ranked it #1 on my anime list actually. Naruto is very inspirational, full of good values and adventures that wil take each one of us in very thrilling fantasy. Because of this anime I became more and more like Naruto, friendly, brave and strong! I adore every statement of the characters, even if he/she is bad or good. This anime shows not only fantasy but also reality. It reveals every characters' sorrows and happy moments. I believe that this anime is NOT boring, you will eventually get closer to the true personality of each characters, you could feel hatred or be amaze of that certain character. Story: THE BEST. I rated it as an outstanding one. Every episodes lead to another closer look to the character. I know it got lot of fillers, but it doesn't really matter!! What matter is to understand the importance of the story not what you are seeing wrong on the series. Art: THE BEST.I rated it again as the best because of the well-made fighting scenes although there are a lot of troubles in the fighting sequences. Sound: THE BEST. I really like the sound, the BGM and most especially the OP and ED songs! The BGM suits every scenes and every character, from the happiest to the saddest music. Character: THE BEST. Very well molded characters. Each revealing unique attitudes and emotions. Naruto series really shows that each one of us iare UNIQUE. Enjoyment: I really enjoy this anime! It makes me happy all day!

"**Has Been Re-Edited, Watched as of Episode 62** Story - 5.6/10 (F+) What story? Oh the Ninja boy wants to be the best. Where have i heard this from before? Like countless other shounen shows. But only Naruto has the balls to actually bore us with pointless slapstick comedy and 3-4 episode long fights that hardly resolve anything except more questions. Naruto is like a trainwreck, it's so bad yet you still watch it to laugh at it. Animation - 5.0/10 (F) Aside from the whole &quot;Sexy Ninjitsu&quot; thing, all of it rarely ever changes. It feels so old and worn out, nothing else catches my eyes. Sound: - 7.8/10 (C+) This is where i change my tone for the most part. I can honestly say i like every single opening of Naruto, it fits the mood for the first 1:30 of the show, then the other 21 minutes is just horrible. The soundtrack is alright, but just that. Character: - 4.8/10 (F) We have: Naruto, our favorite ramen-loving, orange jumpsuit ninja. Ok? We mostly have the same old characters until we get Jiraya and Orochimaru and Itachi. Even with them, it still feels so old and dead by now, that's where i stopped watching it. Enjoyment: - 8.0/10 (B) So why the hell did i enjoy it? Well, it seems that EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, Naruto screws up. That there is enjoyment. Whether it's an assault by Sakura, or just plain screw up, i love it (it's supposed to be a bad thing, by the way.). I can watch the filler episodes and just laugh so damn hard at Naruto failing.

"Naruto is recommended because it offers a unique blend of action, adventure, and heartfelt storytelling that has resonated with a diverse audience. Despite its imperfections, the series has left a lasting legacy and will continue to be enjoyed by both new and seasoned anime enthusiasts. Let's start with the obvious elephant in the room - 1. The notorious filler episodes. ""Naruto"" is plagued by filler arcs that sometimes feel like a detour through the ninja equivalent of a scenic route. A lot of it are outright cringe-worthy and has no significance or much value added to the main story. Pacing Predicament: 2. The pacing in ""Naruto"" is a bit like trying to sprint a marathon. While the main story arcs are engaging, there are moments when the series seems to stall, especially in the earlier episodes. 3. Flashbacks are to ""Naruto"" what ramen is to Naruto himself – a staple. Yet, there are times when the flashbacks are reused to the point of inducing eye-rolls. We get it; Naruto had a tough childhood. 4. Sakura, the resident kunoichi of Team 7, gets a fair share of criticism for her lack of growth and action compared to her ninja peers. It's a missed opportunity for a more dynamic and developed character. 5. World Building - Inconsistencies in Technological Progression. The series incorporates both traditional and advanced technology, with a mix of feudal-era settings and modern elements. Like many viewers, I find the progression of technology in the world inconsistent, raising questions about the timeline and development of certain technologies. Now, for the Good parts of Naruto: 1. The side characters in Naruto are often considered one of the anime's notable strengths and contribute to what sets it apart from other series. Naruto introduces a vast array of characters, each with distinct personalities, abilities, and backgrounds. From the members of Team 7 to other ninjas in the Hidden Leaf Village and beyond, the series provides a diverse and memorable cast. Many side characters undergo significant development throughout the series. The narrative takes the time to explore their personal stories, challenges, and growth, giving viewers a deeper understanding of their characters. Unlike some anime where secondary characters might fade into the background during battles, Naruto emphasizes the strategic roles of its side characters. Each ninja has a unique set of skills, and their contributions often play crucial roles in major conflicts. The series showcases a wide variety of fighting styles, jutsu techniques, and combat strategies among its characters. This diversity adds depth to the battles and makes each character's approach to combat distinctive. 2. Naruto introduces a wide array of characters, each with unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. The character development, particularly of the main cast, is a standout aspect, showcasing growth, maturity, and the impact of their experiences. 3. The series is adept at delivering emotionally charged narratives. Whether exploring themes of friendship, loss, or determination, ""Naruto"" has poignant storytelling moments that resonate with viewers on a deep, emotional level. Iconic Soundtrack: 4. Naruto features a memorable and iconic soundtrack that enhances the emotional impact of key scenes. The music, composed by Toshio Masuda and Yasuharu Takanashi, has become synonymous with the series and contributes to its overall atmosphere. 5. Epic Battles and Animation - The anime is renowned for its intense and well-animated battle sequences. The choreography of the ninja fights, the utilization of jutsu, and the strategic elements in combat contribute to the series' excitement and visual appeal. 6. The series employs long-term story arcs that allow for extensive character development and world-building. Viewers witness the characters' growth over time, and the overarching narrative creates a sense of continuity and purpose.",9,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9c7ec4ef32,4

"Okay so the art and sound was of any anime, but that's not the point. The story seemed intesting at one point, but it fell apart. Way too nija cliché . It was devastating. I heard so much about this series and was expecting so much more. The characters were simple. The main character was the ""apprentice wants to become the best there is and travels with his friends to achieve his goal"" kind, which we haven't seen much of *coughPOKEMONcough*. It was dumb. And the humor was terrible too. I think that this anime is really only meant for anime junkies or otakus who don't care much for the story and just care for the cool outfits and sayings in the stories. This story had way too much of bad comedy, obssessed girls(which tried too hard to be funny and it sucked), and a lame plot. It really ticks me off that people even dare compare this series to Bleach. ? Really? Bleach actually has some depth to the plot and some sensibility in it.

Instead of continuing the real story for a year and half they made filler. Bad filler, filler that makes you question wither your time should be waisted with this. And a lot of people though that it was a waist of there time and stopped watching. That is why I gave it a 5. If they didnt give it the most amount of filler ever it would have been a 8.

"I first watched Naruto, by way of fansubs, when it had just come out and it was still only in the Japnese audience. I remember that I was instantly hooked after watching the first maybe five episodes and because of that continued to follow the series. Basically, I can tell you that the story is pretty decent. At the beginning it takes some time for them to get to the true plot line which is Naruto's nine tail fox; however, the arcs before the real plot line present a basis for the main plot line. And, I can honestly say that while I was watching the arcs like the &quot;wave country&quot; and etc etc, that it was quite entertaining and it was a &quot;page turner&quot;. Nonetheless, the entire story is a bit stereotypical, but it is enjoyable nevertheless. The whole story is action-packed w/ plenty of comedy. The characters are a bit stereotypical as well. Naruto is the hero that people don't understand; Sasuke is the loner that nobody can understand. However, this is not a problem as the way they present them seem to be original in itself. Well, overall I could write a lot more about this series, but if me to get to the point then here it is. The fillers killed this series, like no other. I think that there are actually more fillers in Naruto then there is real episodes. Therefore, what should you do to remedy this fact? You should just skip all fillers and head straight to the main plot because the main plot is something that is quite interesting and entertaining, while the fillers are just plain horrible and bad. Believe me, I tried to watch some of them and the fillers of Naruto were extrememly boring and had no originality whatsoever.

"Besides having a cool theme/platform, Naruto doesn't have too much to offer. Even though this anime is ridiculously comical and annoying at times(due to over-exposition) it also has a very likable story. Naruto didn't exactly play it safe with all of its hidden secrets the story is based around, secrets that are completely shielded hundreds of episodes into the series. Its clear that what still keeps Naruto shining as a story is its characters, say what you want but Naruto is definitely considered to be the most recognized anime ever--and the general story isn't exactly a masterpiece. So, about those characters: Am I implying that without them being exactly how they are Naruto would've failed? NO. The idea of such a sad upbringing leading up to these characters is what makes them so much more special. In the first episodes of Naruto you're getting a glimpse of what Narutos entire childhood has been like, and before you know it things are lookin' up! This makes you feel personally attached to Naruto or at the very least makes you appreciate how much you get to see Naruto progress throughout the show(which, is what the show is solely about for the most part). The main problem people have with Naruto is; it's 'mainstream' or 'too hyped', both of which are formed from peer pressure basically. Mainstream is not a bad thing, it just means they're giving people what they know they want. As long as it's still enjoyable who cares? And as for the hype, all I have to say is: Nothing great(whether positive or negative) goes without hype, does hype change anything though? Hype always comes with a reason. Example: R*pe. Lastly I'd just like to say, MOST ANIMES AREN'T MEANT TO BE PERFECT--JUST ENJOYABLE. I've seent many animes and I like all types - can't you stop trying to be a critic and just try to enjoy it? I did and its only made me happier, so why not? - Thanks.",8,Recommended,"May 30, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_034942264f,4
"The first time I watched this series; to be honest, once I got into Shippuden it was so great that I ended up underestimating the original 220 episodes. After a long time since then I'm realizing how much foreshadowing the first show sets up for Shippuden's greatness, things I totally forgot were introduced so early in the story and now I appreciate the original show much much more. The first time I had my sights set on action before anything else in anime and that made me blind to everything else this show has to offer and immediately compared the sequel to it claiming to myself that the sequel was better. They are great together as one unit, believe it! MOTTO? Why do people get so annoyed by Naruto's believe it motto, it's better than Sakura's chaa! At least believe it means something. Point is, a lot of characters have their repeated catch phrases so stop the nonsense about this. SUB or DUB? First time I watched this show was subbed, this time around I'm doing dubbed. It just happened that way. I like both honestly. A great way to find out which you'd prefer without someone else's opinion - just pick one, when you get to a sequence of scenes that you really like rewatch it in the other language then pick the one you prefer. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter - I read really fast when there's subtitles, I don't read them to myself in my mind, as quickly as I skim with my eyes I have absorbed the context and dialog and yet still you miss some visuals that way so it's up to you. FILLER? Honestly in any long running show not every cannon episode is something so great. Some filler episodes are crappy, some cannon episodes are crappy. The only reason that is is because our minds are constantly comparing things, so you just have to shut it off and let the story consume your attention.",10,Recommended,"Oct 29, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b964e93d63,4
"Well I have to say I was dissaponted in this anime a bit. Its very over exaggerated. Well the characters are much too simple and lack depth. Though they are comical which could be a decent aspect. Characters here tend to tug at my tolerance. They dont feel relateable. I dont feel that connection between character and audience. Honestly the main character{Naruto} just seems to piss and moan. Theres too many fillers and fights drag on for episodes. The art is bearable. But the plot isnt too complex either and theres almost no plot twists. For older audieneces, I feel this is more like a waste of time. That audienece have tendency to enjoymore thought provoking shows.

Throw this at their faces and if all goes well (it did, for me) theyll be begging you for more. A boy that is destined to be hated for life, alone and sad forever. Naruto shows that no matter what kind of society that you in and no matter what is thrown against you, you are the key that makes it better for yourself. Written down in a world where ninjas and inner spirit power (Chakra) takes place, it opens up a new way of how we or should i say, i, look at ninjas. Forbidden techniques, country-colonizing, 3 man teams. You wont know what ninjas really do after you watch this. Sadly, to me it kind of lost a great deal of fans. A year long series-killer, fillers.

"For some reason loads of people like this anime, I really do not get that. I watched the show until a certain villain (do not want to spoil it for others, just because I am civil) died, because the villain was the most interesting character. I mean: Naruto. Uninteresting character with the""a super powerful creature is inside you"" cliche (seen it in yu yu hakusho, bleach ans a ton of other shows). What does he want to be? A ninja... That is the begin motivation and then I wonder ""how do I connect to this character?"". Then the failed attempts to make him funny make him annoying, his power is not that interesting and then I did some research and it will only become worse. Sakura. What is there to say about her? did she do anything in the first 2 seasons? well... she jumped before an old man to protect him with a kunai... and failed to do so. And that is all my faulty memory remembers about her. Sasuke. Somehow he is the beef cake bad boy personage, that got girls in real life swooning over him, I really do not get you people... He is bland and monotone, but hey at least he does things! Fights. Nothing that we have not seen being done better in older anime (yu yu hakusho for example, hell even dragonball and flame of recca were better in fight scenes). Big weapons are being used (what use is a shurken if it is foldable and has a diameter of one meter?) mostly and when they use their kunai their utterly useless. Then they use their ninja magic to fight, sasuke mostly breathes fire, naruto copies himself and sakura does nothing. No real tension in this anime from what I have seen and does not really motivates me to look further (and I watched some horrible anime, willingly (though they're not on my list because they are quite obscure and I forgot their names...)). Premise. Ninja ninja ninja ninja, ninja ninja, believe it! Even though they are not ninja's since they do not use any stealth, I can forgive them calling themselves ninja's, the problem is that they keep putting attention to it! WE GET IT YOU ARE A NINJA AND NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT! STOP SAYING THAT! And Naruto has some kind of 9 tailed rabbit thing that says it is a fox sealed inside him for a reason and there are people with very unusual weapons that would not be that good in our world, but hey suspension of disbelieve, eh?

"-The fans are waiting for the plot to continue, we need to delay it. We will need fillers, lots of fillers. -Hundrends of fillers... -But my lord, there is no such force... ""doors open to reveal a sea of fillers"" -This night... You will feast on the patience of fans!!!! ""But Bleach had a lot of fillers! And you gave it a perfect 10!!! You hypocrite!"" Yes, but Bleach had filler ARCS! Consistent, well directed, logically lengthed, ARCS! And gradually improving ones too. The Nozomi Arc (the last one) was in fact as good as the main story if not better. Naruto on the other hand has one-shot episodes. AWFULLY written, one-episode fillers that add nothing to the story and are in fact a real pain to watch. Also, Bleach didn't interrupt the main story more than the number of Filler Arcs. Naruto on the other hand usually throws one main story episode and follows it with a filler one. This is unbelievably annoying, as you feel the story keeps getting interrupted by fillers. CONSTANTLY. Main story episodes concerned, Naruto offers amazing battles (especially the exam episodes at the start of the series were AWESOME) that leave you really impressed. The rules of combat are well explained (moves cannot be repeated indefinitely, every skill has a weakness, people get tired, etc etc) and the music makes the fights all the better (keep in mind that the length of the fights is pretty good). Character designs are also very distinctive, so that, like bleach, you will remember almost everyone (and unlike One Piece I might add). A problem that appears halfway through the anime and starts appearing waaaayyy too often later on, is the obsession of the mangaka with ""history repeating itself"". The first time this became evident it was quite cool, as you didn't expect such a good ideology from the script. The second time you still liked it but a bit less. The third time you just patiently waited for the anime to get over with it. AFTER 100 TIMES IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. Every team in existance is composed of 2 men and one woman. One of the men is quite serious and cool, the other is a fool that constantly draws attention to himself by acting stupid, but is in truth the big-hearted one. EVERY, F$%KING, TEAM. Calling the plot ""repetitive"" would be the understatement of the year. Another thing that quickly becomes annoying, especially in Shippuden, is how the show constantly throws at us that Naruto had a rough, unfair childhood. Again, the first time it was a very welcome addition to the anime, showing how far Naruto has come to be respected by his peers. But when it's done in every single episode you really start hating it. No more flashbacks please! I don't care how much money you save with the animators! Get on with the plot! If the above weren't enough out of the three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura) Naruto is a complete idiot, Sasuke can't decide between being emo, an avenger or Itachi's little brother and Sakura keeps pursuing the same guy for about... The whole anime + Shippuden. Not the most inspiring of leads to be sure. In fact if it wasn't for the awesome battle music I'm pretty sure Naruto would be hated by everyone. (Oh and for the record: I absolutely hate Jiraya as a character, there I said it!)

"Erm. Yes, I'm advocating for the positive side of Naruto... Just don't shoot the messenger :P Currently, there are 26 reviews written for Naruto, out of which roughly more than half advocate that Naruto sucks, is not worth watching, and is simply overrated. Right. So we know that the fillers are horrible, the plot's &quot;typically shounen&quot; and Sakura never does a single thing. But why exactly has Naruto become so popular? What makes it tick? What keeps reeling in the dough for Kishimoto? There are a variety of reasons. Naruto is the very embodiment of the shounen psyche. It deals with some common fundamental themes that appeal to the audience. Valuing your friends, never giving up, and challenging the status quo are just a couple messages conveyed by Naruto's plight. And we, the viewers, can relate to those themes. Supposedly. Then of course, are the insane battle scenes. True, some battles are incapable of suspending disbelief, as you think &quot;that's doesn't make sense.&quot; Then there are the parts where someone has to explain every move he makes. However, overall, the animation, the music, and the &quot;situation&quot; all add up into something that excites and awakens the ninja within us. (Wow, that was corny) There's also a fair bit of humor involved. Most of it is slapstick comedy, such as the teasing born from the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry, while other comic scenes truly manage to touch the humerus (episode 101, anyone?). However, some of the older viewers are nonplussed by many scenes which simply come across as stupid and juvenile. Though i'm sure Kishimoto knew crass humor is a double edged sword at times. Finally, Naruto is often geared towards younger viewers. Yes, those little midgets everyone ignores on internet forums and discussion boards (lovingly referred to as &quot;Narutards&quot;) are probably the greatest reason why Naruto has gained such popularity.

"So. Naruto is a great show. I think a lot of people get too comfortable being so critical of this show when they forget this series debuted in 2002, over twenty years ago. Look at the other shows from this year, none of their names are particularly famous. So now when people watch this show with the expectation that it is the best thing out there, (when they became anime fans later on and watched a plethora of other shows beforehand) they forget that this show is a product of its time. When I watched Naruto, there was the ""big three of Shonen"" One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach (Dragon Ball, Evangelion, Inuyasha and Yu Yu Hakusho were a bit earlier). It's hard to speak about Naruto and ignore the impact the show had on the anime industry as a whole. Naruto brought a lot of international anime fans, and there's a reason; not only are the story and characters compelling but the animation is good. I won't lie, there is a lot of ""filler,"" but if you look at the bigger picture the filler adds important characterization to the story. Naruto is one of my favorite shows, so much so that I wrote about it in my diary when I was younger. The soundtrack also SLAPS. Since this review is only for the original and not for Shippuden, I will give it a higher score. While yes, Shippuden shares qualities with the original, there were some misses in its execution. ANYWAYS, I think critique is good, but people need to realize this is a 20+ year-old show, from a different time, when there were fewer international anime fans, and when anime wasn't as mass-produced as it is now.

Well, first off, yeah this was the first Anime I saw, hence I loved it, but that ended quite horridly some episodes after episode 80, when it started falling, and I mean FALLING from grace, it fell so hard I nearly cried. It started out as a great anime but turned out to be some repetitive piece of crap.(Spoiler) I must say that no anime has had me as close to crying as this one from the things that happened around the Zabuza time(Spoiler). So my advice is to only watch up to about 80. (Only for those who have seen it all) : What pissed me the most of is when they repeat the EXACT thing that happened around the Zabuza time with that other 'sword dude' who has two swords instead of the gigantic Zabuza one.

"Listen listen listen. You need to know that I'm reviewing this based on the canon parts of Naruto. The reason it's probably rated so low on average on MAL is because of the amount of filler that's in it. If I was taking all that into account, I'd probably more likely rate this series an 8 instead of a 10. However, since I'm not going to do that, please let me tell you why Naruto is one of the best anime to be made. The story in its barest form isn't all that original, right? It's typical Shounen, so I can't really vouch for the astounding, original plot. However, I can and will brag on the story that was told through this anime. Before I do that, though, I will point out that the pacing of the plot does sort of ignore unnecessary things. It may feel to you that's it's moving a bit swiftly because there isn't a whole lot of buffer between arcs, and the arcs don't waste any time getting to their main point. That being said, I absolutely love this coming-of-age story. I think it translates loneliness and childhood really nicely into a fantastical universe. Though, as I said, the pacing is a bit fast, the story itself blends really well to the point where you can't really tell the difference between where one arc ends and another begins. I can't brag on the details of the story too much because I don't want to give it away, but it makes you feel empowered, and though the bare plot isn't original at all, the way its told has multitudes of personality. On to the characters. I always say that great characters are necessary for a story to be good, and in fact, they can even carry a terrible story if they need to. Naruto has a brilliant story, but its characters are what make it so beautiful. For one thing, this anime isn't afraid to make every moment an important one for a specific character, and I like that because it means that we get to see these characters grow up and change in a realistic way. Also, the friendships that are created through the story really make it worth watching, if nothing else. The strong bonds that are formed are portrayed really well, and I think they're used well also. What I mean by that is these characters are written in such a way that they each affect each other at every point in the story. It's a cool way to depict friendship. I'm very bad at reviews, but let me leave you with this at least: watch this anime. If you need to skip the fillers to enjoy it, do it, but the main story is so worth it. The voice actors are amazing, it's brilliantly funny, and it'll touch your heart in a way nothing else has. It's a classic for a reason, I really don't think you'll find anything quite like this anywhere else. And, if nothing else, I hear the sequel series is way better, so you may as well watch this and then have a good time with that. I'm sure going to.

"Well, you've got to admit Naruto is one of the most popular anime in the world, also because it's also aired in the US. However, popularity does not represent everything. Naruto, definitely was very ideal and imaginative with these super ninjas. The three main characters, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, all had a close relationship for they have been in a team for most of their time. Naruto and Sasuke, who were supposedly natural rivals, fought their best to compete each other and tease about the others' loss. By the time this arch enemy Orochimaru comes, this anime changes its environment. For the whole entire time, Sasuke leaves with Orochimaru, and therefore Naruto and Sakura tries their best to regain their lost friend. They all realize missing a friend could be fairly drastic towards everyday life. They tend to become stronger and fight with devilish opponents to move on and retrieve Sasuke. However, on the other hand, Sasuke refuses and once tried to kill Naruto because he had another objective in mind. Then, what kind of anime is this? Naruto and Sakura wants Sasuke back; they need him to be happy and believe that would do best for him. On the other hand, Sasuke refuses and fights back because he doesn't feel happiness in between their friendship. He wants to kill his brother who destroyed his clan. In the future, &quot;if&quot; Naruto ever caught Sasuke, what would they even do? Put him in a cage and lock him so that he won't escape? That's totally ironic! They want him back, but they know he's become all crazy, so they don't know what to do, but to seriously injure him so that he won't go back to his evil scheme. Is that even true friendship? The music is definitely great, for it gives different types of ideas. The music provides the thought of living in a peaceful village and swaying through history. One certain types of music from Naruto, it gives the idea of exciting actions full of thrill. The sound produced in Naruto is indubitably original and unique. The part where I enjoyed Naruto the most would be the beginning, where all of the story tends to make sense. Yet, in the later episodes, the author seems to push on forcefully to draw random frustrating plots.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 22, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_332586ab77,4
"I first watched Naruto as a teenager, around when it was released, and thought it was dumb and dull. Now nearly 20 years later, as a 34 year-old, I decided to revisit it...and am more confused by its popularity than ever. Shounen series had been around for a long time when Naruto was adapted into an anime in the early 2000s. Weekly Shonen Jump began publishing in 1968 and big hits like ""Ashita no Joe"" and ""Tiger Mask"" followed soon after. Monster 80's hits like ""Hokuto no Ken"" and ""Dragonball"" would define anime for the decade and spawned a slew of imitators. Now, shounen is a formulaic genre (main character becomes stronger to defeat increasingly menacing foes), but that doesn't mean one can't do interesting things with it, or create very good, even great series. What strikes me the most about Naruto is how shabby and uninspired it is. In terms of plot, characters, and even the art, it resembles a forgettable early 90's shounen that poorly and lazily tries to copy more successful properties. To begin with, the art is basic and undetailed, and looks shockingly bad for an anime made after 2000. Faces lack distinguishing features aside from hair and eyes, and even the bodies are often interachangeable. It gets even worse with any action sequence, a central aspect to any shounen. The movement of the characters is all wrong, resembling that of an ungainly trash bag rather than actual human motion. One way the animators try to make up for this shortcoming is reducing the number of frames used, but that makes it even worse. Oftentimes, we see nothing between a character staring at an opponent and then suddenly hitting them. All the wind-up and movement in-between is ignored. For a series set in a secretive ninja world, it's surprisingly small and drab. There are very few characters that truly matter, and we meet most of them at the beginning. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Hinata, who we encounter in a dingy classroom in the first episode, are the four main characters, and shape the ninja world as much as anyone. The Third Hokage, the most powerful ruler, is also met in Episode 1, and presented as no one special, just an old man administrator. Rather than a rich, expansive world with mysteries and an abundance of unique, competing groups and ninjas, Naruto feels meager and limited. It doesn't help that the villains are largely forgettable, too. Shounen heroes take a variety of forms. Some are more reserved and stoic, while others are passionate firebrands. However, all the successful ones have one trait in common. They're cool. Whether it's the silent badass or the manic underdog who refuses to give up, these are heroes young male viewers respect and want to be like. By contrast, Naruto Uzumaki is lame. He is loud and annoying. He doesn't take his ninja studies seriously, or ever demonstrate a consistent dedication to becoming stronger or better. And yet, through a deus ex machina, at a critical moment in a fight he says something menacing and threatening, which sounds laughable coming from this clown, and quickly wins. There's nothing cool here. His victories feel undeserved and he reminds me of the loser spastics back in school that no one liked, not anyone worthy or aspirational. Lastly, the writing is lazy, riddled with plot holes, and disrespects its own world. Take the very first episode, for instance. The Third Hokage is able to see Naruto through a crystal ball. Why then are the ninjas he deployed to find him unable to do so until Naruto triumphantly returns many hours later? Did the Hokage not communicate with his retainers? Do ninjas have no form of communication, and were none of the ninjas left behind at the village to protect it or receive further orders? The actual answer is much simpler. Interference would have spoiled the scene of Naruto defeating a treacherous adult ninja, and the writers hoped the viewers wouldn't think too hard. But there is a much worse scene in the first episode. At the beginning, using a Clone jutsu for a school exam, Naruto is only able to summon one copy of himself, and a useless one at that. Later, at the climax of his fight against the treacherous ninja, he summons countless dozens of clones, all capable of effective combat. What changed? This sensational improvement occurred in less than a day with just a little more practice on Naruto's part. In other words, we're meant to believe he was a miserable failure after presumably months or years of training, yet is a spectacular success after less than a day. Incoherence aside, if a jutsu can be mastered so thoroughly with less than a day's effort, then jutsus are simple and unimpressive. After all, would you respect anything, like Tic-Tac-Toe, that could be mastered in less than a day? Notice that even a flawed series like Dragonball treated martial arts with far more reverence. Fighters would make great strides only after training for weeks, months, or years. And this was usually not any normal training, but under the guidance of a legendary figure (Master Roshi, the Kais, etc.), frequently in a unique environment, like the Hypberbolic Time Chamber. In this way, the series conveyed the difficulty and magnitude of attaining a higher power level or learning a technique. In Naruto, however, all it takes is less than a day's practice, so we must conclude that this is all child's play. (And given that these powerful ninjas beating up adults are in fact children, it is!) Of course, there are further plot holes here, as Naruto spawning 100+ copies of himself should easily defeat countless future enemies, but he conveniently doesn't always use it. Or waits to do so. Thus, we see that in every regard, Naruto is a very lousy, uninspired example of the shounen genre. The real mystery is how it ever became financially successful. I might not necessarily like other megapopular shounen, but in every other case, I can understand their popularity and acknowledge that it had either good or unique qualities.

"Well, well here's Naruto. Oh joy. OK before I start reviewing this I would like to point out that this is a review and therefore it will contain the personal opinions of the person in cause, me. What was the point of me saying that, one may wonder? Well, simply put, it's due to the fact I'm well aware of Naruto's huge popularity and therefore I'm certain a lot of people that will read this review will, probably, find themselves frustrated of what will they consider of me being completely devoid of any taste in anime for not realizing the geniousness of this anime. Now with that outta the way let's head on the review. What's most important for any anime? Of course the story. I'll be direct and say that the story , in my case, is nothing short of dreadful, and therefore get's the 2 thumbs up from me. It's based around a kid, who so happens to have lost his parents, and therefore is an orphan, and the challenges he'll face in his quest to become the greatest ninja in his village, which is called Hokage by the way. Seems simple but yet intriguing now doesn't it. Well so have I though till I actually gave it a watch. To my surprise the story falls flat on it's face from the very first episodes. This is mostly due to the story itselfs being in contradiction with the world in which it develops or maybe the other way 'round. The plot device here is the ninja world. However in Naruto's world, the ninjas seems to be the inverted version. Where a ninja has to be stealthy and calculated, here most ofem shout, scream, jump head-on in a confrontation and apparently don't even bother wearing proper uniform, something to help disguese them, instead prefering to walk around in bright colors so that everyone may notice them. Art get's a 5. All I can say bout it is that it was good but overuse of recycled scenes made it eem cheap and there less enjoyable to watch as the series progressed. Sound get's the 6. It's great that's for sure but unfortunately it suffers from the same problem as the art of the show. As the series progressed the soundtracks ued got cut down untill eventually they ended up recycling 4-5 more memorable soundtracks for every episode that followed while the others went into complete obscurity. Character. Oh boy. 1. I really feel sorry for their characters. Aside from the main characters the rest are underdeveloped and bland, and some go as far as succumbling to certain stereotypes. Example: A fat guy in one group that thinks alwys 'bout food, eats all the time, and oh wait he can also use a technique which makes him even fatter. Yeah, if that's the idea of a character of a comedic value than to Naruto's misfortune it's long overdue. And ther re lots more. Smart kid who is too smart to even bother, kid who ties to win his crush over by standing up to the guy who seems to popular, guy too popular but who doesn't care about anything etc. And the list could go on. To underdevelop a character is one thing but to completely throw out the window the ntion of balance between is completely another. And again, while this is bad, Naruto seems to excel at this. Main characters get stronger by learning new powers while old ones are stuck with the very powers they started with and as the enemies appearing get stronger and stronger the only thing these side characters end up showing is how useless they've become or are becoming. And the main character is also a reason the whole show falls. His annoying and completely unlikeble. Ok Naruto we get it that you're an orphan and despite that you have the guts to stand up to the injustice that life's done you and pursue your dreams but that isn't a reason to keep remnding us this every episode. And also the sheer amount of positivity in this guy in contrast with how he behaves is something that is completely unrealistic. The choice in doing such a character also limits his development possibilities which in turn diminishes the viewers interste in even following this character. He's not worth it. You already know he has a strong belief in the morale values he upholds and , therefore, regardless of watever challenges he faces he'll always pull it off 'cuz of his strong beliefs. But his constant reminder of this aspect of him really makes unlikeble due to the fact that after a while it gets anoying and can't help but give a weird sensation that the show is just trying to scold you and shove it's morale lessons down your throat. With this said I can only state that I hardly enjoyed Naruto and to put it in a nutshell, it gets a 3 on the Enjoyment meeter but that's only due to moments of amusement from how ridiculous this whole show is and of how hard it tries to be serious. Overall I give it a 2. The art and sound doesn't save the show from me giving it a 2 due to the fact that, as well as they might be, the whole experience is poor.

"Naruto was one of my first anime that I just found randomly on TV. After that I watched like first 35 episodes and then they stopped it... I really liked Sasuke and Naruto, and even then Sakura was useless at least I though so. What got me into it? It probably has to be the idea of ninjas, wars and mostly Naruto's and Sasuke's back story. The idea of a fox that was sealed inside a little boy was mind blowing to me. And that everyone hated him, because of it kinda reminded me where I was at the time. The openings was really good as well, but there was some openings that I didn't really enjoyed as much as others. Watching this anime was a great experience, because after they stopped airing it on TV I remembered about it after 2 yrs ago and then got really into it... Naruto thought me one thing: It's to never give up, no matter how bad it looks.",7,Recommended,"Feb 23, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_822f962da0,5
"Naruto is SOOOOOO popular. All anime fans know of Naruto. Even non anime fans know about Naruto. I'm always surprised when I see that someone has never heard of Naruto before. Anyway..................Story: 10/10 The good thing about Naruto is the UNIVERSE. There are many villages, the villages have ninjas who can use jutsu. Jounin, Chuunin, Genin, Hokage, ANBU.... And the awesome story where Character:10/10 the main character is a lonely orphan with a demon fox sealed inside him, so the entire village hates him. That's an impressive fact. Naruto. And the other main character is a boy who's older brother killed his entire family/clan. Wow. Sasuke. The third main character is a normal girl with nothing special about her and a hell annoying personality. OK. Sakura. Boring 0/10 So Sakura gets a lot of hate. But the good thing about this character is that she gives us a lot to expand upon, if we use our imagination or write fanfiction like Sakura's Glasses where you can give her the Sharingan or whatever powers you want or place her wherever you want in the plot or make her get trained by Obito or something. 10/10 Basically this is the best anime because it lets readers get creative with the characters and make fanart, fanfiction, doujinshi, yaoi, etc. So even if the story is lame, the universe is good and makes up for the rest. And it's still an interesting story. JUST, make sure you skip all the fillers because it has nothing to do with the story, it's a waste of time unless you don't mind comedy episodes (for me it's hard to humor me and I hate all things comedy so I hate fillers,) Then it will be good.

"The creator of Naruto series is written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto sensei all he had to do is to create one of the greatest manga work and eventually lead to anime adaptation by one of the significant studio by Studio Pierrot for visual treat. Naruto is based on the shinobi jonor in which we all get to know about the various themes and elements of hardships, leadership, importance of friendship, realities, loneliness, hatredness, student and teacher relationship, sacrifices etc. STORY Naruto is a fictional story regarding the adventures of the protagonist of the series Uzumaki Naruto along with his companions. Naruto aims to be the Hokage ( Highest office ) of the village Konahagakure. Naruto is crazy and troublesome guy who always trouble people for gaining recognition, as his parents died for a noble cause. Naruto is an orphan and always it's a sad to see as no one consider him as a person and they treat him like demon. Naruto is a weak shinobi. But there it comes with the load of background music there starts the journey of Naruto in which, what, why he able to defeat odds, how he is successful, sets a new definition of friendship in manga and anime. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT Along with Naruto there are many other exceptional characters. Most of the characters have background stories which is great for Shounen long running anime. It's always a good insight for a anime to show the depths of the characters and their goals. Even senseis role is almost the backbone of the story where they mould their students for making them full fledged shinobi. There are some episodes in which scenes are emotions based on the reality grounded and I got tears. So, I want to share one of my experiences regarding a character Rock Lee when he fights Gaara in Chunin exams when he was fighting very hard and had tough times in which there was a flashback of him and sensei regarding discussion of hardwork. And his sensei states to Rock Lee that ""you are genius at hardwork"" . And then Rock Lee gets tears in his eyes and looks at his sensei and offers his gratitude during the fight. I liked the description of most of the characters and their evolutions by bringing new techniques for making fights more intense and insane. I admit that most of the characters shared coordinal relationship with Naruto and it took shape brilliantly by Kishimoto sensei. Most of the companions of Naruto they considered Naruto as a inspiration. ANIMATION It was a great prospect for Naruto anime series that it was adapted by Studio Pierrot. Animation at the times of 2000's was not good for present generation but I have to respect the those times and I have to move on. Fight scenes are very rich and intense fights are shown very well. The characters are shown very fluently but there are some errors regarding the animation it sulks little bit though I enjoyed. The village and forest scenes shown very excellent by covering all kinds of backgrounds well captured by studio Pierrot. It was a good animation and it was very pleasant and satisfied regarding the various techniques in the fight scenes are shown with extreme mix and caution. At last I want to say that Studio Pierrot didn't disappointed me in animation. MUSIC Mostly I like this segment just sounds wow regarding some of the openings of Naruto is well shown and they showed situation driven oriented related openings in every arc. Background music of Naruto is worth mentioning regarding the intense rage, excited, emotion based is great while fight scenes got boost due to the background music. Background music represented each and every scenes and situations, even humor fittingly. So far they did great job for handling the Naruto work. For Orochmaru character the background music was nail bitting. When the characters use their jutsu in fights the music was getting better and better and I liked the intensity of music and it is a great plus for Naruto anime series. SPECIAL MENTION In Naruto series most of them stated that there are so many fillers in which most fillers ruined the complexity of the story and there are some fillers which are worth watching. I to agree. So if u skip the fillers or if you watch the fillers that's completely based on your schedule and interest. I watched fillers and I found some of them are annoying and some sort of lengthy narration ruined the episodes and some are great. If you are starters then go and watch Naruto anime which gives you a great platform as a anime watcher. It is a great and simple story which the characters justifies themselves with all sorts of elements shown in a typical Shounen anime. CONCLUSION At last I want to conclude that Naruto is by far one of the greatest anime. I want to acknowledge their efforts and hardwork of Masashi Kishimoto sensei, Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo etc put in this whole series is great and best in it's own way. I enjoyed myself like never before. When I remember the character Naruto I always become emotion, passion, excited that I wanted to follow his ninja way and his philosophy.",9,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_602e25c7f9,5

"Ah.... Memories. Aside from Pokemon and Digmon, I can proudly say that this was my first anime series. For this review, I would only be covering on the Naruto series not the Shippuden one. The series portrays a young ninja named Naruto that aims to become the next Hokage(Leader) of the Hidden Leaf Village. I'll start off with good parts of this anime, the story or plot line is brilliantly done, with good twists every now and then makes the viewers ever more curious to know what is coming next, this is what truly makes the series addicting. Character wise, really good back story for each of the characters, although most of the supporting characters of the series is shown on Shippuden. Even so, the series tried its best to form a relationship between the reader and the characters which render the viewers more attached to the series and thus creates ""viewers loyalty"" As there is light, there will always be shadows, one of the main cons of this series is that with episodes reaching over hundreds, there are way too many fillers and unnecessary mini-stories. I understand that the purpose of fillers is to make time and space for the writers to come up with idea for the main story line, but sometimes the fillers are way too long. The visuals are not as well done compared with other anime. For instance comparing it with the 2006 anime series Fate Stay Night, the visuals are quite lackluster. With that being said, the pros of this series clearly outshines its cons. In my opinion, the story line of the anime is much more of significance compared with visuals and such. Oh yea, there are way too many openings and ending songs too cover, but leave it at that, some are good and some mediocre. All in all, this is one of the anime that I would consider a gem and would hold a special place in me as this is also the anime that brought me into the anime universe.",9,Recommended,"Jul 8, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9e6eb0717c,5
"I’m not ashamed to admit that I love Naruto. It is my favourite anime of all time and no matter how good the anime is that i watch in the future nothing can ever compare to the feeling of nostalgia i have towards this amazing show, Naruto was one of this first proper anime i ever watched and growing up watching the same characters grow and get stronger made me enjoy every episode even more. Naruro is known as one of the ""Forbidden 4"" it is one of the biggest anime of all time and is still going to this day (as of making this review), the only thing i can say is if you want to watch a anime with an amazing cast of characters a long running show that you can watch for hours on end with amazing fights and great story arcs then i highly recommend checking this show out then watching its successor Naruto Shippuden. This review might seem a little biased and not very helpful but its hard to find anything wrong with a show you love so much, sure the animation might not be great anymore and there is alot of fillers but if you can look past that the story makes up for it, and at the end of the day great characters and an amazing story is more than enough to check this out in my opinion.",10,Recommended,"Apr 26, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9c7cacd635,5
"Oh my. Naruto. I almost shed a tear when rated it so low, because i wanted it to be any better than what it has become. Naruto is for me on of the best anime out there if you only count from episode ONE to NINETY NINE. It has commedy, no romance, action and excelent fights and a great character development for the protagonist and perhaps other ""sub"" characters like gaara for instance. The way naruto finds his way to release the ""hidden fox"" inside of him and the way naruto rivals with sasuke who would later become his best friend and enemy is superb. In the beggining he is much of a wuss, but he gains strength little by little through tough training and lamen eating... (~datte ba yo ! ^^) and not through inconsistents powerupps !!! === BUT === After episode 99, there're fillers and the story starts to get slowed down so much that one episode would contain half of the last episode in the form of flashbacks and the other half being flashbacks of earlier parts of the SAME EPISODE... until it gets to a point where you would get FULL SEASONS OF FILLERS and the anime starts to get UNWATCHABLE. But people tend to forget/ignore this move and that's why he is just another OVERATED series here in anime list. So if you rate naruto for only his 99 first episodes (10+++) but as a whole series with 220 episodes in total (3~) we get about 45% of the anime being very good and the whole rest not. Naruto still managed to have a sequence as bad (or worst) than its fillers, called Naruto ShiFillerDen... Just to finish it, the protagonist has his own name as the title of the series, wich means we can't expect that he will ever die. xD",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 26, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0a76133944,5

"Many people out there love Naruto and I can see why. The characters are compelling, varied and interesting and the storytelling has many parts that are likable. But there are three big problems that drags everything down. Here they are. 1: No-one ever changes This is mostly true for Naruto, but also for other characters and situations. It seems that the more important the character is, the less the character develops. The only development you see is an increase in abilities and power, but with such a cast of characters so much more could have been done. Thusly, Naruto is a show of wasted opportunities and weak character development. 2: Very slow pace There are large parts of the show where the last part of the previous episode makes up the first part of the following! Seriously! This means that during that time you will LITERALLY not miss a single frame of animation if you skip every second episode. Also, some battles are so drawn out that you almost expect the participants to drop dead from old age, or at least hunger. Picking up the pace at most places would have helped the show immensely. 3: Fillers The dreaded fillers, episodes that do not follow the main storyline but show adventures apart from it. They have been handled well in many shows, but in Naruto it seems that almost every filler was written by someone who doesn't like writing stories. There are a few gems to be had, but for the most part they're boring and irrelevant. Fillers can help develop the characters, but this just doesn't happen in Naruto. In conclusion, Naruto can be very good and very enjoyable at times, but finding those gems means watching a whole lot of boring and repetitive stuff. A shortened version with only the good parts included would make it a much better series.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 16, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_811ded73c3,5
"Naruto: More Than Just a Classic. When we talk about anime and the greatest works in its history, it’s impossible not to think of Naruto. This incredible shōnen has been the starting point for many of us in the world of anime, and that’s why it holds a special place in our hearts. Its story is gripping and exciting. Even with filler episodes, it manages to stay entertaining and keeps you wanting more. The characters are diverse—some are well-developed, others not so much—but it’s almost guaranteed that one of them will become your favorite. In my case, it was Gaara. The animation, while not on par with today’s modern productions, is still beautiful and expressive in its own right. The soundtrack is simply wonderful. Every piece fits the scene perfectly—whether it’s a battle, a sad moment, or an emotional one. It’s flawless. In conclusion: if you haven’t watched it yet (which I doubt), you’re missing out on a masterpiece. Watch it—you won’t regret it.

"People seem to dickride this show in recent reviews so lets talk about it. WARNING, this review will almost definitely contain spoilers. Im not covering the whole show, just the 220 episodes of the naruto, which means i'll be excluding shippuden. So naruto starts of the series by basically being an asshole bratty kid and basically says to everyone, ""you cant do the things i do, im the main character, im better than you"" The show always tries to preach to you and emphasize the lesson that even if you aren't born with amazing gifts, hardwork can always make up for it. Let's mainly focus and talk about the Neji vs Naruto fight during the chunin exams. Lets first establish the two characters, Neji and Naruto are mirrors in this instance. First lets talk about naruto, but which naruto? There's a lot of fuckin naruto's in this series. Obito is a naruto, Jiraiya is a naruto, Tsunade's stupid little brother is a naruto, Tsunade's supposed boyfriend is a naruto, Kiba's a naruto, Hashirama is a naruto, Sai's brother is a naruto... It seems like EVERYONE at this point is a naruto, TOO many naruto's. But lets talk about my most favourite naruto of them all, no its not naruto, its Iruka Sensei, the most useless and unimportant character in the series. This guy made a big deal about caring for naruto at the start of the series when everyone hates him because they're so similar, his parents died when this big fox that lives in naruto's anus, or spinal cord, i dont really know where. But this fox ate their house or something and munched on his parents, damn that's quite rough buddy. So Iruka Sensei grew up without parents and he also was stupid. So to get attention he acted like an idiot, when really he actually is. So he's like, hey naruto *while crying*, you also are an idiot and your parents are dead like mine, so i'll teach you how to fail and be useless in the ninja world life like me, and he really did try to do that. Unfortunately for him though, naruto ends up becoming a living god that fights a living god that basically gave birth and created the whole shinobi/human race in naruto. He fought a tree from the moon with an eye with 10 tails or something, idc. But what's Iruka sensei doing by the end of the series? Nothing, just jerking it, no wife, no nothing, no advancements in his career as a teacher or a ninja either. He's just busting nuts against the wall until he dies alone in minimum wage. Why? because unlike naruto who is ACTUALLY VERY TALENTED and has a lot of shit going for him that this guy(iruka) will NEVER have. This guy is naruto if naruto wasn't a talented hypocrite who yells hardwork all the time when really he never worked hard at all. The series makes a big deal at showing how talented and privileged naruto really is. They bestow upon him and spoon feed him on a silver platter many gifts. The first of them is 9 tails from sonic that lives in his ball sack or something. Since its a japanese anime they have something called chakra which they act like its physical stamina but really its not and its just magic points that allows you to do magic tricks that you can kill people with and cause big magic explosions without having to make am actual bomb or something. So, tails the big red fox has ALOT of magic points, LIKE ALOT and when Naruto runs out of magic when he does stupid and pointless shit during the so called tactical fights which he usually does tails the big red fox do will give him more! How much more? just however much the plot needs. Heck at this point its like pokemon when the animal wins the match for the trainer and everyone is like ""WOW, tHAT tRaINEr sUrE iS sTRoNg!"" even though the trainer didn't do anything. This anime does just that with naruto's fox thats up his anus with magic powers called chakra. Naruto does something stupid and then the fox bails him out and everyone all around naruto is like ""Wow naruto sure is strong and is really good at becoming a magical ninja now, i better believe it!"" Let me give you one example. Our hero naruto is tricked into stealing some secret high level scroll from the secret ninja association library book scroll place and learns the signature move to make shadow clones. Naruto learns to do this and immediately makes 100+ clones after reading the scroll for JUST a few minutes! Are you kidding me?! This is stupid because later on we find out that being able to make just a few of these requires a ton of chakra points. So how did naruto make so many? Fox hax! Shadow clones are apparently some secret technique/magic trick invented by the 2nd hokage and since it was on a forbidden top secret scroll it apparently is some high level technique taught to high level ninja aka Jonin although even kids recognize shadow clones when they see them and other villagers also recognize it when they see it and enemies all over the ninja world ALSO recognize shadow clones to be some kind of mundane trick so i guess its not that secret..? The point is naruto can only do it cuz he's cheating with his talent and fox hax. He later on even gets told that he's garbage at doing it because compared to his teammates, his magic point control is too weak and he wastes too much of it everytime he performs the jutsu/magic spell trick thingy. He's just dumping a bunch of magic points into the trick until it works. Ironically enough, at the start of the series they show that naruto himself doesn't even know what chakra IS??!! He's not only stupid and a cheat, but he also doesn't work hard and never studies. The thing that pisses me off about naruto is that he always repeats and says that he always tries really hard but in reality we never actually see him try or work hard to become a good ninja. Anyways i think im done writing this review, you kind of get the point. Dont watch this anime its a waste of time.

"In this review, I ignore ALL filler episodes, and I strongly recommend that anyone watching this do the same. If I didn't, this anime would get a 6 at best, which does not do justice to the episodes that are faithful to the source material. Naruto has the most intelligent fighting in all of anime, a varied and powerful soundtrack that never fails to compliment the scenes, intriguing villains and likable protagonists, an addictive nature, a semi-realistic art style that noticeably evolves and improves over time, and a satisfying plot, despite being a bit slow. The problem is that all of this is basically there to justify the fight scenes. If those scenes were not there, or if they were not as good as they are, Naruto becomes meh. I would estimate that more than half of Naruto is spent in fighting scenes. This huge dependence on something that, in other anime, merely adds spice to an already awesome package prevents me from ranking this up with the best of the best. On the other hand, those fight scenes are the best I've seen. In particular, characters will set up multi-step plans more or less right before your eyes, without you realizing it. They will then blow you away with the checkmate, and you get an explanation of exactly what they were doing before and why. This makes for intense, thrilling action that culminates in 'OH, SNAP!' climaxes. Intelligence, and not last minute powerups or brute force, wins the day in Naruto. Furthermore, abilities in Naruto always have disadvantages, limitations, or risks, which are made clear to the viewer. There are no random asspulls. Even with those restrictions, abilities are basically always used in unexpected and creative ways. The same trick never works twice. Naruto also knows when a simple, emotionally charged beat down is called for, and delivers them. In summary, Naruto is the Death Note of fighting. If that's what you want, definitely watch this anime.",8,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1583ee57f2,5
"Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are my favorite anime, but i'm going to stick to my guns and give this show an honest review. Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime. Now on to the review :p The animation is good, nothing special but it's not bad at all especially for its time. the voice acting still holds up as spot on emotional at some times performances. This applies for both the Japanese and English dub though i do recommend the English. The story is great, some if not most episodes end in cliffhangers making me want to watch more. The show is well balanced with action and dialogue/story moments. Aside from some crappy fillers, the episodes do a good job building up the story and telling it well. Some fillers are good and fun to watch, while others seem like a complete waste of time. up until the 100's there are hardly any fillers at all and the story stays consistent with build up and excellent storytelling. The story does a good job at showing progression throughout the series, the characters mature and change and the story evolves. When one arc ends, a new one starts keeping its roots to the central story but being different at the same time to not just feel like you're seeing the same thing over again. The characterization is one of the show's best features, as the story goes on, you genuinely start to care about these characters and understand them well. Certain characters are kept mysterious when they need to be, and it's interesting to see their intentions revealed over time. With other character's it's nice to watch some change and mature as the show progresses on. The story isn't full of crazy plot twists or intense action though. However this is only part 1 of the series so it's done like that for obvious reasons i guess. The action at some points is spot on and can be surprising as well, but like i said the show can sometimes lack a real intensity. Basically that's everything, i didn't truly have any gripes with the show, but it's obviously nothing outstanding and perfect. Still Naruto is a great show nonetheless and i'd highly recommend it.

"Alternate viewpoint review: (SPOILERS and REALISM follows) Naruto is a young boy being raised in a Dystopian society where young children are trained to become assassins. The nations of the world sponsor shinobi villages where the self-ran villages each train a significant portion of the populace to become shinobi in the interest of securing income for that village. Naruto grows up in the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the first of the villages founded; and based upon the ""Will of Fire"" philosophy that puts village and the next generation ahead of the individual. They are certainly the ""good guys"" compared to the Mist Village where the children once ritualistically killed each other to achieve adulthood. At the start of the series, Naruto is an orphan who is also social outcast in his own village; for he had a 9-tailed fox (a powerful being who has caused many disasters in the past) placed into him as a baby. Despite this being a village where freakish ""jutsus"" (including infesting your body with parasitic insects, and supernatural abilities of illusion and murder) are the norm, Naruto is shunned for choices he did not make. Motivated to gain respect and acceptance amongst the people (with an absentee Godfather who's off womanizing, he has no support at home), Naruto seeks to become a great ninja and leader of the village. A lousy student, Naruto steals villages secrets to pass his studies and finds himself on a team with his rival Sasuke (an emo boy who only talks about murdering his brother), Sakura (infatuated with Sasuke, because murderous emos who ignore and belittle you are the hot item in this messed up village); and led by Kakashi; a man who lost all his teammates in battle and has been a black ops assassin ever since. The group trains and progresses. Naruto progresses by tapping into the dark forces of the fox and by transforming into a naked, prepubescent girl to gain training from his neglectful godfather (who was supposed to train him to begin with). Sakura relies on passive-aggressive tendencies and is generally useless until much later; despite being a genius. (good moral; Brains are useless, you just need to try hard to get everything) Sasuke relies heavily upon his family's legacy, eyes that allow him to learn jutsus and understand them naturally; that and years of murderous hate. The team faces their first struggle when they learn that the evil Orochimaru, a great former ninja of their village, seeks Sasuke's body. At least they acknowledge something wrong with a man in his 60's proclaiming he needs a pubescent teenagers body. Rather than react to the creepy stalker and take action, they instead go on about business as usual; and the result is a terroristic attack where Orochimaru assassinates the Hokage (the village leader and his former teacher). During this, Naruto squares off against Gaara; another boy who had a monster placed into him. Due to a brutal mindfucking by his own father, Gaara is a homicidal maniac (and unreliable assassin, nice job breaking it Kazekage!) but has his worldview shattered when Naruto proclaims he's fighting for his friends and defeats Gaara. Sure, the fact that Naruto's monster has 9 tails and Gaara's only has 1 (a measurement of power) had nothing to do with it... Naruto then sets out with Pervy Sage (the aforementioned Godfather) to find a woman who should be the next Hokage. The woman is Tsunade, a woman who is a compulsive gambler, frequent drinker, and spends a great deal of power to look over 30 years younger than she is. Apparently these are great leadership qualities in this world! Then, as if to underline Naruto's arguments about the quality of friendship; Sasuke betrays them to run off and join Orochimaru to gain power, ignoring all the people he's killed and is offers his body in exchange for power. Sakura, always the team player, gets Naruto to vow to return Sasuke to the village; a move that puts both their lives at risk. Enforcing the immature, ""treat broads like crap, and they love you"" philosophy at play. Much more happens, but basically Naruto has to deal with the fact that all the people in this world are permanently scarred (raising children to murder...nah, can't have anything to do with it right?) and is able to win people over to brighter point of view by just being a swell guy...or he kills them. Summary: It's actually a great series, but I figure almost everyone who's into anime has seen or heard about this series. I felt it was important to illustrate that this series is VERY disturbing once you get passed the silly Shonen antics.",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1f972c58d4,5
"Naruto is definently not as good as people say it is, the story has been done to death, but most other aspects of the series are good. Story: like previously stated nothing new here, ninja boy reaches to achieve his dreams, has many wacky and serious adventures along the way. Art: The animation for Naruto is good, i would put it above what Shippudden is like right now, the character design isn't really all that different, i mean 5-6 sub-main characters have permanent spiked hair. Sound: The intro themes are some of my favorite, i love Asian Kung Fu generation, and i never really listen to the endings but that doesn't matter, the music they use tends to fit the scenarios, ie.no hard stuff during funny moments, but most anime has decent sound tracks. Character: Like most shonen anime they catch with the characters, and they are all well made. You can find all the different characteristics in this anime, emo, goth(gaara), pervert, blah blah blah i gerantee you will find at least 1 memorable character in Naruto. Because of the easily predictable story line, my enjoyment of the series is lost, half way through all the episodes you can pretty much predict who its gonna end, but its still worth your watch. Overall im giving it an 8 good series if a tad predicatble, but hell its a shit load better than shippudden",8,Recommended,"Apr 8, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2527a3686c,5
"All right, first review on the site, and probably not the last one. I remember that a friend of mine suggested to watch the series, then I started. It wasn't bad, but sometimes I feel it's boring. The Chuunin Exam was pretty good, and that's where I decided to keep on watching the series. Right now I'm watching the Shippuuden, but currently it's on hold until it reaches a point that I found interesting in the manga. *cough* Jiraiyavspain *cough* Some fight scenes are memorable, but they are pretty rare in that many episodes. Talking about many episodes, Naruto might have the slowest story from all the animes I know. Sometimes I wish I would skip some parts, and sometimes I did: like I skipped the whole filler on the end of this series. Now let's talk about the characters. There are characters you can easily like, and characters you can easily hate. I still don't understand why are there so many Sasuke fans, while he's the worst emo I have ever seen. However I like Shikamaru, his fights always has a twist near the end, and I actually liked Lee before his injury. After that: umm, just strange. =) Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad series, but it could be better at some points. Skip the fillers, and have some fun. And remember: ninjas are always cool ... except if they are from Naruto. 7/10",7,Recommended,"Jun 17, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d9e8bf00f9,5
"Many watched Naruto as kids and grew up with it. Me on the other hand, I'm one those who discovered this series when it was already done, and I was in my 20s. I had also already watched FMA:B a couple years before. so it wasn't quite my first anime. I was very skeptical of Naruto: its character designs seemed unappealing, and its ninja seemed to have nothing to do with real life ninja. I went into it expecting nothing. I watched the first episode not even knowing about Naruto's true nature. So I was genuinely wowed by that early plot twist. What surprised me most about it was to see a story that at first seemed to just be a show about some troubled kid with a lot yelling suddenly take a turn for something actually quite heavy and and quite heartfelt. It signaled to me that this anime packed something more, and was willing to cover engaging, emotional storylines. It had a heart. The characters of this story are an odd mix. They all start out pretty annoying, and in the first episodes, the main trio of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura keep bickering nonstop, and all the other kids are very immature as well. This can easily be plainly annoying. Naruto especially took a long while for me to find likable. But while we have these seemingly weaker characters, some well fleshed out antagonists are introduced, and when all things are considered, most of the characters in Naruto follow a pattern of starting out pretty one dimensional but then being built upon through the following arcs, so that by the end of the series, I found them to be quite endearing. The fights are a big part of Naruto, often lasting multiple episodes. They are always very entertaining to watch, with a good element of tension, a wide range of powers showcased and a lot of thought been put in the progression of the fight. The fight also often reflect a mental hurdle or ideological struggle that Naruto faces, which gives them a double value as both exciting and emotional fights. In short, Naruto is a crowd-pleaser. It has those two essential things, emotion and action, and it is effective at conveying both. It wouldn't be a complete review without mentioning the filler. This series (the first part of the whole Naruto saga) is different from its sequel Shippuuden in that for the most part there is no filler intertwined into the canon... instead it is all lumped in the second half of the series. This makes it possible to see the whole series without having to do the incessant episode-skipping that Shippuuden requires.",9,Recommended,"May 29, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f5cb1b679d,5
"This is one of the most high quality anime out there. I mean what more could you want? Although there are some flaws to this anime. Even though the story and plot are amazing, the art seems a bit outdated. Also if your watching on some streaming site like Crunchyroll, there are black bars on the sides which can be irritating at some times. But besides that, Naruto is a great anime overall and one of my personal favourites. You can enjoy this anime with friends and family. Although sometimes the show can get a bit dark and bloody, overall there is nothing too bad.",9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3fe3908c74,6
"Ignoring the filler: Naruto is an amazing series. Naruto has a plot that pulls you in, sometimes you have no idea how a fight between 2 people will turn out until the last 30 seconds, sometimes not until the fight has finished. Almost every character in the whole series gets character development and you learn to love everyone for either being: cool, strong, confident or because of how evil they are. You have to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Otherwise you are joining a story right in the middle and nothing will make much sense. The filler can be annoying and it is all not worth watching, you could always come back to it after you have finished the series but first time watchers, I recommend skipping them. I mean come on, they animated the whole story of Part I in the manga up until the very last chapter, then they put 84 filler episodes in a row before animating the final chapter of Part I. Also, don't read the summary for Shippuden until you've finished the original series, I'm so glad that I did not because it completely gives away the ending of original Naruto and will affect how you see characters the first time watching it. If you would like a filler guide and to enjoy the series to its maximum without ruining it with pointless, bland filler, watch these episodes only: 1-25 27-96 98-100 101 is filler but based off of a canon omake (short story). It is funny and the only filler I recommend watching. 107-135 Then the last 11/12 minutes of episode 220. You should know when the canon starts because they replay the final canon scene from episode 135. I hope that people give Naruto a chance and watch it they way you're supposed to, without filler.",9,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ce05f37899,6
"For some reason, every single review I read on MAL looks like they were typed by a person who is about 12 years old, but trying to seem like they are a seasoned writer. I won't be doing that. This is my honest opinion with no attempt to razzle and dazzle you. (Though, I may not be able to help it, as my writing tends to be on the more ""professional"" side because of my profession lol). Anyways! If you haven't watched Naruto yet, GET ON IT. Why should you watch it? I'll tell you why: it's incredible. I am a normal adult male. I am not a self-described ""anime freak,"" though I thoroughly enjoy a ton of anime. This show doesn't feel like your typical anime. This is a show that everybody can enjoy. You get to see the life and progression of a little jackass in a village full of serious ninjas and over time, you begin to see a bit of yourself in Naruto. (At least, I did. I was just like him. Lashing out, being mean to people, and all the while hurting on the inside). But, there is so much more to it. Naruto starts out as a show about this kid that nobody likes but when the show progresses, you learn so much about him. You learn why he acts the way he does and you begin to feel for him. You want to reach out and tell him ""everything will be ok."" However, there is no need for that. The sheer optimism of this kid fills you up with hope and joy. By the end of the series, he had fulfilled his goal to become Hokage and he is one of, if not THE, strongest ninja in the world. When its over, you realize, I have grown up with this kid. It makes you think why you aren't doing better in your own life. Believe it, achieve it. Signing off folks.",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3efa08c0cd,6
"Naruto is really typical, it seems like one of those infamous series you hear about all the time, so you tend to watch it to satisfy your own curiosity. It's not as bad as some people claim, yet I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever watched. Story: Here's the thing with the story of Naruto, it's really a good plot, it is, minus the fillers that is. Once the fillers kick in, the whole enjoyment aspect of it just fully decreases. I'm rating the story aspect of it based on the story itself, not the fillers, hence why I said it was very good. The rating for this anime would really improve if they did it in seasons. Sure, the thought of waiting months for the next arc is a bit frustrating, but at least the fans would get something worth watching. Art: Nothing really to say about art, it's really typical so I wouldn't say it stands out. Sound: Most of the opening and closing seem to fit appropriately with the genre of the anime, same goes for the background music used in the anime. Character's voice all fit nicely with their respectively characters, which helps to bring out their unique personality. Characters: The characters themselves are average, like most series, they all tend to wear the same clothes all the time, probably to better acquaint you with them. What I'd like to comment about is the use of skills, at first you see their unique skills and you find it really exciting, but some of them are really getting overused (Naruto's Rasengan), this again, leads back to the fillers. If there were less fillers, their wouldn't be a need to do such a thing and fans wouldn't get so sick of seeing the same skills over and over again. Enjoyment: I did enjoy it, but you have to look at it as a whole, which means in the presence of the fillers, in which case my enjoyment decreased as each episode goes by and getting frustrated at seeing Naruto's Rasengan for the billionth time really didn't help either. Overall: A good anime consists of many different aspects, each must come together nicely for the series to be successful and for a good rating. Naruto lacks in some areas, and no surprise, the ratings are what it is. I'd still recommend it to those who wishes to enjoy all anime like I do, but for those easily frustrated by long series, this is not for you.",7,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ff60e24228,6
"Naruto is truly a special anime that flourishes in heart, intrigue, originality, and emotional impact. This review is only for the canon episode 1-135. The original Naruto, meaning the pre-timeskip story, has earned its place among the very best of the shonen battle genre in my book. Every single-story arc brings a unique storyline that is filled with emotional, suspenseful, and epic moments and builds on the world and characters of Naruto. The world of Naruto is filled with originality and detail. The lore of the villages, the clans, various jutsus, and many other detailed systems give you great insight into the complexity of this world. The story will show you the harsh and sad nature of the ninja world, and how it has affected the people who live through it. Naruto’s story is not only exciting and emotional, it also has a lot of thematic depth. Ideas of loneliness, failure, pain, hate, genocide, social class systems, revenge, and many more are explored through this story. Kishimoto's ability to not only write compelling main characters, but also write an assortment compelling side characters is one of the underrated aspects of the Naruto series. This anime is filled with unique characters that have so much to offer down to the nuanced side characters. Seeing how our protagonist and his friends/rivals develop over the course of these 135 episodes is amazing, and specifically between Naruto and Sasuke is one of the best examples of a compelling relationship and parallel in all of anime. The deep emotional impact of Naruto is well-known, and I will completely agree this this story will tug at your heartstrings. In the shonen battle genre, I can think of no other anime that even rivals it in this regard aside from One Piece. Another skill of Kishimoto’s is his well written backstories for his characters. There are numerous backstories for both primary and secondary characters that are made with such care and passion that you come to understand these characters in a way that most anime don’t achieve. It also mixes some comedy elements at the right times that are genuinely funny, and dont feel overbearing like many other shonen. The final point of excellence that most recognize is that it has exciting and strategic action. It contains many of the most incredible and iconic fight scenes in all of anime that contain intricate plans and cool abilities. Naruto is the definitive king of hype when it comes to anime. There is no other anime I know that pulls off epic moments of overcoming obstacles, suspense, coolness, and achieving something great. It's a very fun series, and I think it balances all of its aspects well to show originally what makes a great shounen battle series. Its multifaceted and excels in nearly all areas. The canon story is contained in episodes 1-135 which are the only episode I recommend you watch from the original Naruto anime, unless you are interested in filler. Once again, Naruto is very special to me. I think is deserves more respect as a great work in the anime community; its not just a mainstream surface level anime. It an excellent anime that offers so much, and is fully rewarding to experience.",10,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b2fc826dde,6
"This was my gateway series. I had watched a lot of anime in the mid 90's but gave it up completely. I reluctantly started this series thanks to a persistent friend. This is the first part of the Naruto Manga (up until the time skip for his 2+ years of training). This is one of those anime that is difficult to turn off because it's just so good. This is yet another series that has established itself as a timeless classic right up there with Dragonball. The violent world of the ninja in this series is filled with surprisingly rich characters. There is a lot of comedy and a lot of drama. This series takes you through a full range of emotions, and the psychology of the battles that these 12 and 13 year old kids endure is amazing. The battles are clever and not necessarily done in real time so you can gain insight into how each character handles the situations move by move. The graphic and violent nature of this series makes it a crime that the english dubs target younger audiences. One of the biggest themes in this series is comradery. Naruto is an orphan that is hated by his village due to the incident surrounding his birth. He has to form bonds with others pretty much by overcoming one hardship after another. He earns his friendships through blood, sweat, and tears. The respect he gains is admirable, and he seems to do it while being a little slow on the uptake. The overall message remains heartwarming throughout. The message really is a good one. If you must watch this series I advise picking up the ""uncut"" version. The last couple of seasons are almost 100% filler, so I do advise watching this filler free. The story from the Manga is adapted very well if you skip over the filler. I know some would argue that point with me, but it stays close to the Manga without filler, and the manga is a near masterpiece.",9,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_fd3595139b,6
"Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. The story takes place in a world where ninjas are very powerful and are a valuable and necessary government resource. The story centers around a young, ambitious, over-zealous boy named Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto dreams of becoming a very strong, formidable ninja and one day The Hokage (The leader of Naruto’s village. The Hokage must be, if not one of, the most powerful ninjas in the village). However Naruto is ostracized because of the fact that inside him is the nine-tailed fox spirit that was sealed inside of him after it attacked the village and killed many ninjas around the time of Naruto’s birth. Upsides Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. Naruto is filled with many intense, dramatic battle scenes against enemy ninjas and has many likeable charismatic characters that you are guaranteed to fall in love with. Furthermore, Naruto has an always interesting, ever-changing storyline that goes far beyond fight scenes i.e., Naruto’s love/hate relationship with Sasuke who is a naturally gifted ninja that is always pushing Naruto to do better. Naruto and co. also offer a substantial amount of humour to go along with the stellar action and spectacular story. Downsides There aren’t many downsides to Naruto. That being said, there are some. One of the most prominent flaws being the slow pace, for example, the fist arc which really isn’t much more than an introduction to the main characters lasts about 15 episodes. A big, but avoidable problem is the number of fillers. Alost 90 of the 220 episodes have no relevance to story are frankly, garbage. Luckily, thanks to the wonderful resource that is the internet, one can easily find which episodes are fillers and subsequently, skip them. But if you are a hard core Naruto fan and sitting through hours of episodes that have nothing to do with the story, there is nothing wrong with that. At first glance, the young ages of most of the main characters may turn a few people away. It never actually states how old Naruto is but he appears to be about 10ish. But it really is irrelevant. Before long you will be indifferent to the ages of the kids.",9,Recommended,"Jun 28, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e176df6122,6

I first watched Naruto after enjoying plenty of other great anime series and I was still surprised at how awesome it is. It does have some cliches but everything does at this point.

"I used to like this series. I used to enjoy it. Not anymore. This series does not age well. I found the apex of the series to be the Chunnin Exams and the very moment that Naruto decks out Gaara was probably one of the better moments showing the differences between the two. But now, looking back....it wasn't worth the time. Some of my favorite series have less episodes to work with and tell more interesting stories. Some of my favorite series have less plot, but are a lot more enjoyable. And some of my favorite series run less than the amount of filler episodes in this series. Overall, I lost interest. I still like a couple of the characters. But I've outgrown the series. Naruto himself as a character stopped being interesting and was turning into the whinny little kid type I found throughout the series. Sakura is just useless and Sasuke reminds me of a slow and way dialed up emo Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho. This series is a cash cow, it was fun at the time, but now it's run it's course and doesn't age well. A lot of the series development is either pointless or easy to see from miles ahead. It's easy to see why kids from 10-17 like it. But I'm 23 and outgrew that trend. There are better series out there.

"In a lot of ways, Naruto is better than its sequel, Shipuuden. The power levels are tame so there is less of ""throw explosive lasers at each other until one side wins."" Naruto is also characterized in a more interesting way than his Shipuuden version. He's a cheeky prankster which makes for an entertaining and endearing main character. I know that he had to grow up, but that's just a shame. Despite being a fan of the series, partly through nostalgia and partly through appreciation, I think some parts don't stand the test of time. The animation in most of the show hasn't aged well. It's inconsistent and even feels choppy at some points. There's also the aspect of people staring at each other for too long, padding the runtime. The yapping is cheesy a lot of the time. The villains aren't characterized in an interesting way (in this part at least). Also, the bulk of the story doesn't happen here, making this a really long introduction. Obvious advice: Don't watch the filler.

"To say that I was bored when I typed Naruto into Youtube would be a little understated. I have been watching Keroro Gunso For a whole week, my computer was just fixed( watched Keroro Gunso on the PS3 web browser), and I have no real friends would make me completely bored out of my skull when I typed in Naruto…even though I never regretted it. Naruto follows the plot of every single Shonen to date. A Young man has something that no one else has, he begins to use the thing to fight his way to the top of his imaginary society, and he will be fighting off against his best friend or family members soon. In this Anime’s Case, Naruto has a demon, he uses it’s chakra(spiritual energy if I am right) to get his way to become the leader(Hokage) of his Ninja Village. While watching the first episode, I was honestly surprised to find the Japanese voices to be a bit annoying, so I switched to the Dubbed version and even was more surprised to find I actually liked it. The voices fit the characters well(But some of the characters sound a little too old for their age) and the script wasn’t half bad and it wasn’t censored so much that to explain the dead bodies, they say their ‘sleeping’. The storyline is pretty much standard, but it picks up enough after the first story arc and I get pulled in after the rookie 9 meet for the first time. That takes…20 episodes. You might be asking why I stayed in that long if the story was standard fare. And I will say because the characters are incredibly easy to relate to and even easier to like, if not love. Naruto is pretty interesting as a main character in his own little way, and Sasuke can probably make all the girls in the world rise up and cheer if he just kisses Naruto again, and Sakura…well…doesn’t do anything but otherwise she stays out of the way most of the time and is interesting in her own way. The other main character is Kakashi, the most kickass teacher in the whole F’in world. He is mysterious and yet not moody, He is incredibly powerful but not arrogant, he has a great sense of humor without trying too hard. In fact, You could have given the entire series to Kakashi and he would probably have the same(if not better) success as naruto. The supporting characters are just as good, and all of them have a great back story and deserve to have the praise and fan fiction they get and more. But every series has it’s downfalls for people…and for some it’s worth not watching a great anime. The first problem(complaint) is that Naruto is filled with Fillers. And I honestly say that the popularity of Naruto thrives on Fillers. To point out why I think that, lets compare two animes that are known for Fillers. Dragon Ball Z A huge fight at the beginning…and then we wait the entire season for at least something like that to happen again. Meanwhile, We get to train! And Train some more! And we get to watch Goku learn two boring moves and when he finally uses them, they are nothing but wimpy when used on the two enemies where only ONE was damaged. Naruto The Fillers show more of the character themselves and I can’t distinguish one filler episode from just a regular one. Naruto has fillers filled with character development that I love and cherish(Except for that kid in episode 2, I smiled when he cried at the Hokage funeral =) ) The Second problem is that Naruto has stereotypical characters. I admit, many of the characters that Fans like all have some sort of troubled past or they watched their entire village get slaughtered(WINK). But Yet again, I am not picky and all the characters are stereotypical in a way that isn’t obvious as some other animes. The Third problem is that Naruto is copying off from other anime, which I find silly because Anime is always the same really. In fact, most of the anime you find will look incredibly similar story wise. But Anime is special in that the characters are always new and fresh and can easily be related to. Naruto is no exception. The Fourth and final problem is the flashbacks, and I honestly can say that you will get a flashback about every 5 to 10 minutes! And the flashbacks always focus on what happened in the last episode. There is a point where we already have gotten five different aknoledgments from the characters of what happened, we need a flashback on what just happened. In short, Naruto is a anime that you will enjoy if you are open minded and want something new. You won’t like it if your complaining about the characters jumpsuit and you don't like Ninjas. That means your a Pirate guy right?",8,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0a772de120,6
"Naruto is amazingly awesome. Until you get to the part that is completely overrun by filler. Everything besides the filler of this show is truly good. The story is well-designed, the art, sound effects, and music are all very high quality. The show really shines in terms of characters, featuring many characters who all express pretty good development. The story does kinda span over what seems like too many episodes, but for the most part it does deliver high quality action and character interaction very effectively. Well, until you get to the non-canon filler. Despite the fairly low rating I'm giving this anime, I must stress that several of the most impressive moments in anime history do occur here. Character interaction at some points has never been better, and depending on the type of person you are, this anime does have the potential to bring tears to your eyes as your mind is blown away by what could be the most appropriate ending to the best fight scene you may have seen in your entire life.

"I will repeat something that has already been said in other reviews: Naruto is the most overrated anime in history. Yes, but I will be honest in my analysis. Story: Nothing to complain about, it could have been better, but it manages to be attractive and cool. Art: I am not exaggerating, after all this is one of the few positive points that I see in the work as a whole: Art. There are characters with very beautiful features, of course, nothing complex and superior to other works, but analyzing Naruto separately, this is perhaps the only point worthy of a good note. Sound Production: I think for a lengthy anime, repeating the same soundtrack may be a bit overloaded, but I can not say that OST's are bad, on the contrary, they are always well-matched. Nothing complex, nothing out of the ordinary. Characters: The reason for my 10th note to the characters is due to something that you will only understand if you watch the sequel: Naruto has good characters, and for an extensive work, he deserves admiration for not forgetting several characters. The characters are well spent, fun, charismatic and developed. In the final arc, we have the use of several characters that needed to be developed, and they end up being: Neji, Shikamaru, and others. Besides the lack of protagonism shounen in that part. Enjoyment: Despite being a good work (note 8), it does not captivate much from one episode to another, ends up curling up in some parts, which discourages watching, but still worth it. Overall: 8-This part of manga adapted in anime, deserves that note. It is not a very original shounen, the end is open for continuation, there are good characters that are used, and a work that, however it is not my favorite, is a good work! I do not recommend the continuation, since almost everything I mentioned here is reversed in the continuation.",8,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_33fc665a3f,6
"This is one of some shows I really don't know why is so successful. I can only guess why: It was one of the few animes transmitted on the TV with an easy way to watch. I guess this because of it was the very situation on my country down to the last decades, so I think this is the overall situation. If you drink some soda, listen to some song or play some video-game, how do you know these things are good or not? Exactly, comparing with other products of the same type. If you have no others products to compare, you will probably find anything great, because it's a pure type of innovation in your life. I'm almost sure it was the reason Naruto became so popular. Naruto is just one of the many commercial crap released with no clue of creativity, if you watch like, Hunter x Hunter before it, you'll easily note the elements recycled to that. Took as example the main character: a good smiley pre-teenage boy with a big dream, how cares a lot about the people around him and is kinda of an idiot. Then you have a cool-head fellow with a serious expression and a dark past. OK, it already is a very big resemblance, but does it end here, right? Nope. Although it does end in the main characters, you'll see many others resemblances in others characters, like antagonists, tutors, aged men, etc. You may think ""resemblances are natural in those types of work because the authors have inspiration and hall"" wait, it doesn't end here, only in the characters, despite we getting two exactly looking characters at the very beginning, it has already to many others ""resemblances"", as we say. What about the routes the plot takes? Our brave kids go trough a lot of ""similarities"" in a way it's kinda of very scary. We got to see them going to doing a time-limited test to take an object from an obviously stronger adult; we got to see them doing an exam to graduate to the job they need to, which you'll see them passing through quest-based games, individual fightings and a time-limited contest that you need to get some objects from other competitors, then get out of the demarcated area, that has some extravagant animals besides the other competitors who will make your objective very much difficult. Although, not everything is the same. Naruto also tries to discern in some cases, but then we get some horrible things: the author tries to write deep characters, I know it, but the think is he don't know how to do it, the maximum he could do was putting distinct characteristics at unidimensional buildings. It's not an horrible move, in fact, is one of the most things shounen writers do. The horrible thing about it is the constant need to rub that in our faces. WE ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH NARUTO SUFFERED, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW HATRED SASUKE IS, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW DETERMINED LEE IS BESIDES OF NOT HAVING NINJUTSU, DAMN. Another horrible thing about the show is how lazy Kishimoto tries to settle the conflitcs up: it's just: fighting, fighting, more fighting, Naruto crying about it's past, fighting, Naruto gaining a lot of power from the legendary creature inside of him to win the fight, ok, this over, everyone happy now. Summing up: this show is a huge caught in the hurricane plot with no creativity at most part, and when tries to create something original, it ends up boring, repetitive, painful to watch and a pure waste of time.",2,Not Recommended,"Aug 6, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b5b4eaab7a,6
This is the second anime I ever watched and going into it I didn't think I would like it. There were a few rough spots here and there like flashbacks (I almost quiet it because of them) but the characters and storyline definitely make up for that. The characters that the show had overall made the show even better because all characters had unique designs and powers and I really enjoyed learning about them all. Many people criticise this brilliant show because of the amount of filler it has but that is easily avoidable if you just skip it as it has no real importance to the story. Animation was a bit rough in some parts but in defence of Studio Pierrot there budget was quite small when they started animating it. This show definitely lives up to its hype and that's why I've given it a 9.,9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0536402eda,6
"This is one of my favorite animes that I've ever watched and obviously to be considered one of the big three of anime. Characters: All the Characters of Naruto I love because they all are different from one another my favorite characters are obviously Naruto, Rock Lee, Shikamaru, and Neji. Just these characters alone show how great the show is also not only that the villains in this show like Itachi have in-depth storytelling that is fantastic. Story: The story itself is great following the boy Naruto Uzumaki on trying to be the next Hokage and the arcs in this show are amazing and are great storytelling. my favorites include the village hidden in the mist, the chunin exam, and the Sasuke retrieval team. these in my opinion were the greatest arcs in the show. Art: The animation for this anime was incredible especially for the fight scenes blew me away with how well it was executed and the fights themselves kept you on edge sometimes and you never knew what could happen especially in the Chunin Exams. Overall: I love this anime and highly recommend anyone this anime who wants to start getting into anime.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4819b4a5c7,6
"Naruto means a lot to me, it was a big part of my childhood but here is where i put my personal feelings a side and review it from an objective standpoint. The story of Naruto is a bit uneven. On one hand it brings some spectacular and great emotional moments but is brought down by the poor pacing and a lot of fillers. There are episodes with great character development, episodes with spectacle, episodes where nothing happens, episodes with turtle pacing and episodes that have fight scenes that never end. The art and animation is alright. Since it is a 220 episode anime the animation budget for each individual episode is not equal. Some episodes look great others dont. The soundtrack is really good. It builds up the action and gets me pumped every time. The dub is an okay dub that gets the job done but you are not missing anything. The characters are the best thing about Naruto. They are well developed, deep and very well written. They feel human. However the antagonists(excluding Zabuza and Haku) are a bit shallow, while pretty cool looking overall not much to say about them. For my enjoyment i can say when its good its GOOD. The chunin exam arc is the best example of this but the fights some times go on forever and filler nightmares dont help that either. Overall Naruto is an enjoyable anime. Is it good? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes. Is it worth the hype? NO! Is it worth watching? Only if you are ready to sit through 220 uneven episodes and thats not counting shippuden.",7,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_450357831a,6

"Naruto is my first anime and is one of the most popular animes out there after it's sequel Naruto: Shippuden. Story was for me very enjoyable and fun. I like how they mixed up school and missions and got awesome storyline for everybody to like. Everything is about friendship, success in becoming a great ninja and honor. Once again story was very well done and I would not change a thing in it :D Art in Naruto is very simplistic, colorful with bright themes and even the ''scary parts'' look that way. You can see good artwork in detailed backgrounds but not in characters...yes they are noticeable in different ways, but not overdetailed as in some animes. Sounds I liked very much...I can say that the soundtracks did a lot for me and my enjoyment in anime. They go well with all scenes and characteristics; happy, funny, sad, agressive etc. There are some soundtracks with flute and shamisen that I enjoyed the most, so I always get goose-bumps when I hear that kind of music in Naruto =) The most important part that makes Naruto what it is are characters. Each different from other by looks, color, clothing, talk, ninja ranks, abilities and skills. They each have their own background story that helps the main storyline. They're all awesomely done and if you don't like anything else, you'll like the characters. I think I already talked about my enjoyment, so I'll just say this; yes, Naruto is maybe little overhiped, but no one should get in anime with a lot of expectations and I guess it's not the best anime ever (for me it is), but it's definitely worth watching =)",10,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1035c5d87b,7
"Naruto is one of those animes that almost everyone knows about. It's so well known, that only in my country, it streamed in 5 different channels the entire first season. If you ask me to describe naruto with one word, it would be : COOL. Yeah this anime is cool. It's not so epic/dramatic/funny as other animes are, but for sure it is cool. What do i mean? Well i just loved the plot.. and for young teenagers, or even for more advanced ages, this anime can make you on the edge of your sit. Plot: 10/10. This is it. This plot is something amazing. I can´t think about Naruto without thinking about a web. Yes a web. There is just so many things to explore, that when you start thinking about it, you get amazed. I watched this anime 4 years ago, and i still find it unbelievable. The originality is astonishing. I mean .. this is not just ninjas .. there is bunch of things that makes this anime so big in terms of content. What really impressed me, is the variety of powers. Here, on Naruto, you have a thing called ""Chakra"". You born with it. It's like your source of energy to use special skills. Then, depending on the person, the chakra can evolve up to 5 different types of chakra. For each type, there is tons and tons of abilities. Plus, there are special powers, that only some have, are transmited via DNA so only members of that clan can unlock those powers and you also have tons of different clans, so you have really a lot of things to look at. While in some animes you get bored because the plot ends up to be the same thing.. here such thing does not happen. There is just to many different types of skills that you will never get tired. There is always something to new to be shown. Plus, it's not just about skills and how many there are. It's also about the entire background story. The anime starts by telling that once existed a demon nine-tailed fox that attacked konoha(our main village), and moves 12 years later, and the journey begins. The plot at first. is simple and nothing great.. but with time, new things will be added, new characters will be introduced. Besides One Piece, this anime has the biggest cast i've ever seen. But unlike One Piece, when everything is forgotten at some point, here they are introduced and they stick with us until the end. When you realize the size of this plot .. well for me it's always a pleasure thinking about this anime. Nothing here is forgotten. Everything has a reason, everything has a explanation, and at Naruto Shipudden, you will realize how everything was connected since the beginning. They always move back and foward, so they really don´t stick with a time line. They often explore things deep into the past and by doing that, they always introduce new characters and new misteries to solve. It is really an impressive plot. Art: 7/10. Well this anime is old, so either the background and the character design is not the best out there. Even though the animations are pretty well done for it's time. I really enjoyed the action despite of it's lack of detail. So i guess they didn´t failed that hard. The character design makes every single character unique, which for me is nice since there are animes out there were between the chracters, only the hair colour changes. And of course, this is a shonen so fan service takes place every once in a while. Personally i don´t dislike fan service, but for who does not like that, don´t worry. There isn´t to much. Sound: 9/10. The sound is engaging. It draws us into the action, which is such a nice feeling. Every single opening is well done. For the spirit os this anime (spirit of adventure) the openings are truly amazing. The tracks used are also great. They fit with the action, and they add something more to it. I would even say, the tracks used make this anime a litle bit epic when it comes to action. But well that is just my opinion. Anyways, i watched this anime 4 years ago and i still remember the openings and some tracks. So i guess they are memorable and so they are good. Character: 8/10. Well for a shonen .. we can not expect more. Pretty much standard characters. But take in mind. this anime was made almost 20 years ago, so back then, the cliche protogonist could not be so cliche as it is now.. Anyways the characters are enjoyable and almost all of them get a decent develop. It only fails when it comes to personalty and reactions. Unlike the plot, the characters are not that original, at least considering that nowadays they all are clichê. Enjoyment: 8/10. If there is one big problem .. is the comedy. Makes this show so childish and only breaks up the mood. The comedy is nothing more than stupid comedy, so it could be deleted from the anime that you wouldn´t miss it. Plus the last 2 or 3 arcs of this anime are fillers. I can´t ignore that. I didn´t watched it but they are there. I've only watched one arc, and it was so boring omfg .. The rest .. it's fucking amazing. I watched every single episode with a smile on my face of pleasure. Really enjoyable.. This show does not have an end.. it has a cliffhanger end to conect it with it's sequel, Naruto Shipudden. Overall: 8/10. Well i reccomend it ! I don´t give a crap about Naruto Shipudden, this show by it self is amazing and deserves a chance. You can skip and you may skip the fillers because they are useless. This show is a nice shonen, one of the best !",8,Recommended,"Mar 15, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d6fbcd71b8,7
"Naruto is an incredible anime, which gets the audience to constantly invest emotionally. Some fans even believe that it is the best anime in all of history. But as cool as Naruto is, it has one major flaw. The moral of the story is inconsistent. The creator wanted to inspire people into believing that hard work would always overcome talent. But this is contradictory to how the story really shapes out, because the main character- Naruto, is handed things, and doesn’t really work hard for it. When Naruto is born his parents die and is left alone in the world. The village hates him for some reason as he is growing up and everyone tries to stay away from him. He is also really dumb. He is the worst student at his Ninja Academy, and is very bad at everything. He truly is the lowest someone can start at. The story keeps on depicting Naruto as the underdog who worked hard for everything and wasn’t born with any talent. That is a complete lie as the story goes forward. For example, both his parents were legendary ninja, so he got their powers which already sets him apart from the rest of his village, and gives him a huge upper hand. Also he is given extra power, because he has the nine tailed fox inside of him. That makes him not only stronger and more advantaged than the kids his age, but also many adult ninja around the world. Naruto didn’t really have to train to get powerful, he just had to activate his existing power in order to become the strongest ninja, and fulfill his dreams. Naruto was a great show, but because of the fact that there is a huge plot hole, it deserves to get two stars. If the main moral of the story isn’t consistent, then what’s the point of the story? The whole story is shaped around the fact that Naruto started from nothing, and he got all the way to the top. The creators wanted to inspire young kids into believing that they too could become and do anything they want if they worked hard for it. While that is a wonderful message, it is meaningless, if you have to give the main character of the story, so many advantages in order for him to succeed.",10,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_95ecbed846,7
"Finished this a while ago, but I really wanted it to have a place in my blog because it really deserves it&hellip;. What an amazing long running series! I truly liked how the characters developed over time through all the events that occur. The action&hellip; AMAZING! The choregraphy that&rsquo;s done is great and well thought out, so every moment of the anime you can appreciate the art and hard work that is being shown right in front of you. Of course, I always watch my anime SUBBED because I want to avoid Dubs as much as possible as it personally feels like it ruins the original work as it revamps anime as cartoons for children. So I gladly get to dodge all of the &ldquo;Believe its!&rdquo; getting to enjoy the anime much more. The only thing that was an obstacle for me was the pacing of FLASHBACKS. It really bugged me that in the middle of the intensity of a fight they break off to a flashback to explain a character&rsquo;s motive for fighting or whatnot. Towards the end, the pacing becomes an amazing story arc leading up to the present &ldquo;Shippuden&rdquo; series, where the flashback sequences are appropriately placed for correct pacing which makes me feel better in the long run. Naruto is a strange character, yet his morales and drive as a young genin makes you want to root for him, so I became really drawn in to follow his journey until the end.

I imagined Naruto's to be more hyperactive, Hinata's less whispery, Sasuke's less mature....The Manga was an absolute masterpiece by Kishimoto and the Anime totally ruined Naruto's reputation. The first opening theme as you all know is crap, consists mostly of shouting than singing. I can understand why everyone hates Naruto. I did too as I read to Manga first and place so much HOPE that Naruto will be a success. The manga was so much better than the anime, there was more detail and everything was from the imgination and genius of Kishimoto. I thought the anime was created by martins at the lack of genius. But at least the storyline and plot still creates a somewhat suspense. I ask everyone now, to read the naruto Manga, the original, created by Kishimoto than crappy anime by MADMAN TM.

Honestly i believe that it is probably my favorite anime including Naruto Shipuden - that i obviously won't say anything thing about, because this is about part 1. Naruto is a very happy anime and very fun to watch because it is so fun. Story: Honestly, i love the story line, it focuses on Naruto, who because he is the Nine-tails jenjurici, gets despised by the whole village. I know that this is moving to some people, because they can relate to his feelings that are shown in the anime. Naruto then gets put on a team with characters: Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura. We find out that Sasuke has a goal to revive his slaughtered clan and kill someone. This gives alot of tension, because we know that Sasuke has alot of hatred and we want to know why. Art: Not much to say really, as this was make in 2002, you shouldn't expect the same stuff that you see in more recent anime. though I love how they all look. <3 Sound: The same, not reallly much to say. Character: I love pretty much all of the characters, though i gave it a 9 insted of a 10, because i frikin HATE Hinata.

"Naruto... What can I say? Next to pokemon, Naruto is a classic. Especially for people who grew up watching it. Now I don't do reviews often so take that in to consideration while you're reading this Naruto is set in a fictional world where ninja roam the land and use techniques called 'jutsu' to amplify their performance. To do this ninja need chakara (similar to kainin DBZ) which is basically their life's essence. Everyone has it, but ninja know how to harness it. Story:10 Naruto is a story about a boy with the same name. The story centers around him and hos friends. As it progresses you see everyone maturing and getting stronger as well as bonds deepening. Yhe story is brilliantly complied into it's own arcs, with fillers being in its own arc. You will see rulers rise and fall. Enemies and organizations Being destroyed or created. And all this is happening to a growimg ninja boy Art: 7 The art was very unique in some episodes. However, you'll mostly see the same kind of background and clothing in the anime. There isn't too much diversity, but when there is, it's extravagant. Just get used to the sight of either a forest, rocky or barren terrain as the fight scenes have all of them sound: 9 The sounds as well as the music were all amazing. You hear some repeats from there but everything was great. From the dialogue, to the intro and outro music, to the sound effects of the fighting! The sounds definitely make this anime that much more amazing Character: 10 Each and (almost) every character is improved upon. Even Sakura herself yes. Those who don't need improvement have wonderfully thought out backstories that are impossible to know NOT know. I can't think of any suggestions when it comes to this Enjoyment: 10 The anime never stops to cease to amaze me. Even after taking a 2-4 year break from it, I came back. Back to the 1st big fight scene between Naruto and Sauske. I wanted to skip fillers and other non-canon episodes so that I can have more time with shippuden. But I couldn't. Thats how enjoyable Naruto is... Final score: 9- Great This anime hit the mainstream market and is praised by many for good reason. It is a one of a kind action comedy anime.

"Naruto is an anime that I would call overrated because you hear more from people hating it then ones who like it. And I think a lot of that is because people want a shows full of mindless violence and flat characters that look cool like DBZ and Bleach. I find Naruto to be much better then either of those. Naruto and One Piece are my favorite Shonen series. What sets Naruto apart, for me, is the world Kishimoto has formed and how every character has his or her own distinct fighting style and personality and dreams and goals. The plot has plenty of twists without becoming complicated and you never have 10+ episodes of fighting one bad guy like in DBZ. Things move at a fast pace most of the time. There are times when it gets boring and the filler is annoying. I just skip it and I am surprised most people just don't look up which episodes are filler and skip them. Simple. Unlike shows like Bleach, Naruto has remained popular in Japan (Bleach being canceled and replaced by a show starring a Naruto side character is proof of that) because it is not the same recycled plot over and over and over and you do really grow to care about the character. Naruto does not deserve all of the hate it gets. I watch a lot of different anime and Naruto is what it is and should be enjoyed as a long running Shonen series with lots of fun for people with an open mind to it. I think people go into every anime expecting a masterpiece and pick them apart for no good reason. Just let go and have fun.

"I've both read the Naruto manga and watched the Anime. My personal summary is I absolutely love the entire series. I liked the following Naruto Shippuden a tad better, but all in all Naruto is the perfect kickstart for this epic story. Naruto is popular for a very good reason, but as with anything popular this also leads to haters just for that reason. I believe Naruto shows us many elements of real life. Even re-reading and re-watching it in my 30's I believe it has life lessons that would make the world a better place and myself a better person. Having guts, valuing friendship, banning hatred. I believe some of these are taught in the story in a very strong way. Story: Especially when re-watching I enjoyed the introduction of characters, jutsu and other elements of the narotoverse. To me, everything makes sense and the build-up towards emotional developments, clashes between friends and incremental strength of characters is well thought out. All things introduced, later appear to have been mentioned for a reason. Not in a big announcement kind of way, but very distinctive. Art: Maybe not all of the artwork has the same amount of detail and attention. That being said, some of the scenes featuring hand-to-hand combat are magnificent. For me the artwork is good enough to have some elements in my child's bedroom. Can't be that bad then aye? Sound: No discussion. Intro and outro are continuously good. Changing every 20 episodes or so. But the real winner here is the beautifully matching and emotional music during various scenes. I know they've pushed me over the edge of having some tears every now and then. Simply beautiful. Character: Some characters annoy me. However, Naruto gives you many many options to choose your favourite character from. In addition almost all of them get enough screentime and a fair share of character development. Some, I simply like more than others (Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Shikamaru, Jiraya, Kakashi). Some (Sakura, Ino, Choji, Shino) are a bit shallow. Nevertheless the connection between most of the characters and the briliant development (and backstory) of some of them made me connect with the whole story. Enjoyment: Both the manga and the anime I enjoyed very much.

Amazing story and characters, amazing soundtrack, the art is good (nothing too special, just good) and really just enjoyable. The plot twists are good, character development feels natural. I really like how characters don't just get powers for no reason and get super powerful out of nowhere. They develop and train gradually which makes it more believable in a sense. But then, at one point, the anime went into 84 episodes of fillers. Now, now, I know some would say ""Then just don't watch them"" in which case I'd say ""But they are still part of the anime!"" In that case, I'd just read the manga. That has no fillers. Really, before the LONG filler period, I'd have given this anime a 9/10. It was amazing. Not super complicated and a bit cliched but I still think it did its things well. Hell, I was okay with the first 20 fillers or something but they got WAY too much after that. It was torture. Now, the story is good. Non-filler episodes have a pretty good story. As I said, the plot twists can be pretty good. The pacing can be slow, like that episode when they did a recap of all that happened previously for no reason. I'll admit that this anime can make you feel really sad when it wants to and can make you laugh at other times. But not the fillers. There are few good fillers. Those are indeed funny and can even be alright stories. But most of them are so PAINFULLY cliched. They tend to use the exact some plot points we've already seen. The stories repeat themselves and are dreadfully predictable. The whole filler thing ruined how the original anime should have ended. The characters are also pretty good. However, they can be definetely a bit samey to some people as some complain about a lot of them having tragic backstories (like, A LOT). However, it isn't much of a problem for me as I love a lot of the characters personally. There are some that are pretty weak, though, a lot of whom tend to be female characters (Gosh, Ten Ten sucks, that's just what I wanted to say. Sakura as well) Then the fillers screwed that up. Most of those characters follow either one of these patterns: dead parents, monster inside, boy turns out to be a girl etc. It's awful really. Which makes the story just good, as well as the characters. In terms of sound, Naruto is amazing in that regard. I really like the voice acting and the soundtrack is beatiful. There are a few tracks and voice actors who aren't all that great but it's nothing too serious. The art is generally good, considering the time period. It definetely isn't the best nor does it need to be. Overall, Naruto is a good anime. The first half of the anime is amazing, before the whole filler thing started, then it went into crap territory, hence why I had to drop my score by 2 points. That's because there are still some good fillers and the first 20 are bearable and the fact that before them, the anime was amazing (even if they love flashbacks a bit too much).",7,Recommended,"May 27, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7a91b32657,7
"While I do agree that Naruto is the most overhyped anime in history, I can't deny the fact that there is some good in this original series. What made fans like me back then so interested in this anime was the main character himself, Naruto. In some ways a lot of people could identify with Naruto due to the lonely childhood he experianced when everyone in the village hated him for carrying a demon spirit inside him. This makes us feel pity for him, and also sets up his role in the series as the hated underdog who never gives up. Throughout this series Naruto and his friends overcome harsh obstacles in their life after they are first introduced into the dangerous world outside their village. Their vulnerability and inexperience keeps us guessing and curious about how they overcome adversity from their foes, when faced with the battle of life and death. A perfect example of this would be the first arc of this story, The Land of Waves, as they travel on their first A-rank mission. When given the chance to return to the village, Naruto vows to carry on this mission by stabbing his hand after he was poisoned by rogue ninjas. This vow shows us his unwillingness to give in, even when it comes to puting his life on the line. This is the point where we start to admire the character and cheer him on throughout the rest of the story. The same types of character development can also be seen by the other two main role characters, Sasuke and Sakura. (Although after Sakura does develop an arc in this series, she does remain the same pitiful character throughout the rest of the series). Sasuke in particular, was also a character people could care about, because although we do know that he was the most skilled ninja coming out of his class, we also feel his pain and despair when his motivation is introduced later on in the series. Other characters include Hatake Kakashi (the three character's sensei), and the surrounding cast of other ninjas in their class. Kakashi can be a well-liked character because of his past experience and leadership with the three, while the other surrounding cast can be just as likeable when they go through certain arcs in their life and eventually team up with the three main characters when a conflict arises. Another good point that should be mentioned in this series is the music. This, in my opinion, is the most underrated part of this series. Songs like Sound and Strike and Sadness and Sorrow were key in exemplifying the mood in certain action scenes, as well as scenes of sadness. This gets us more involved in the scene and interested in what happens next. Unfortunately what brings this anime down to a 7 is the tedious and mediocre filler arcs that follow after episode 135. Since this anime closely follows the manga, there was a point where the anime eventually caught up, and had to wait for the author to pick up on his story. The result eventually led to the tedious story arcs that ran from episode 136 to 220. These arcs had no relation to the story or the characters as they continued to repeat the same plot elements from the previous arcs before them. Although a lot of us can agree that Naruto Shippuden has taken this series downhill since (which is a darn shame), I do think that people should not overlook the original series, and at least try to watch it whenever they get the chance. There's a reason why it is well liked by many, and should at least be considered before looking at the colossal mess in Shippuden.",7,Recommended,"Nov 20, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6d21004a5d,7
"A lot of people who have not watched Naruto have probably heard of how crap it is or how many fillers there are. WELL. Naruto is probably as mainstream anime as you can get and as much as they drag the story on, I suppose it's quite necessary as they explain every aspect of every character's life. The whole story at first may seem to revolve about the main character, 'naruto', who wants to be the hokage of his village (hokage being the head/most strong ninja of the village), but as you get further into the story there are many minor arcs that involve all the characters. Many moral values are portrayed through the anime such as friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and all your typical heroic values. Such as never giving up even though you're spewing blood from your mouth. Though you should probably be prepared for the one fight carrying on for 10+ episodes, normal for any mainstream anime. Overall, 8/10 :)",8,Recommended,"May 26, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ac5b831cdd,7
"Wow. I've been following the fandom and hype of this series for about four years now and i haven't managed to think up a review that encompasses the brilliance of Naruto. It's a staple in shounen jump and arguably one of the best animes of all time. All i can say, while avoiding spoilers, is that its a phenomenal series that everyone HAS to check out. If you're new to anime, then its also a great series to start off with. You may not love it immediately but 10 episodes in and you'll be hooked, i promise you that. It's my favourite anime for so many reasons. It just evokes so many feelings in you. You start caring about the characters so much and becoming so absorbed in the plot without even noticing it yourself. The world building is also so believable that it just makes you want to live it, despite the many sacrifices of being a ninja. Every character and every arc teaches you something new, if you only just stop to ponder. The plot is insane. If you haven't read the synopsis, its about about a boy who hosts a demon fox spirit which is shunned by the entire village but is still determined to become hokage(the village leader). Naruto is probably the only series i have watched where every arc is captivating and keeps you on the edge of the seats. The battle sequences are also nicely chereographed and well-thought out. The plot is carefully woven and well-paced so there are no giant gaps between arcs. The so-called ''filler'' episodes are as funny and entertaining as the actual episodes and also contribute to the plot, rather than filling up screentime with mindless laughs, like other animes do. My favourite thing about the series are the characters and their development. Despite having a huge cast, each character is still given his or her moment to shine and no one is left out. Naruto is a great protagonist. He's spirited and stubborn in the best way, refusing to give up on his goals no matter what the setbacks. Sasuke, sakura and kakashi are also well-characterised. Kakashi, in particular, was a character that i found interesting because of his aloofness and mysterious past. That's the best thing about the series. The characters are all so unique. You won't be able to find duplicates of anyone in naruto. Side characters also fit nicely with the plot and are interesting to watch. Another thing i like about the series is how the villains are treated. They are also given screen time to show their development and are not just mindless and one-dimensional. It's not just the good guys getting all the attention. The artwork was beautifully done and was a great conversion from the manga. As for the voices, i prefer the english dubbed over subbed. I felt that unlike other animes, naruto's doubbed voice actors were casted brilliantly and even surpassed the japanese seiyuus, because their voices suited the characters better. They also didn't sound forced and contrived, like other series do, which was a plus. Overall, i rate naruto an outstanding 10 because its the best anime i've seen to date and it will probably claim that number one spot for a really long time. Go watch it, if you haven't already. Check out the manga version too. You won't regret it.",10,Recommended,"Feb 13, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_898ce4cdb0,7
"This is my first review, and I might be a bit jumpy and in-cohesive, so I would like to apologize before you read any further. This is also the first anime I ever really watched, although my opinion of it has changed over the years. When I first watched Naruto, I was completely obsessed. For days on end, I would complete tons of episodes, entranced by the plot, the characters, the fights, the emotional tug, and the sheer ecstasy I felt by seeing Naruto win over his battles. There is always something magical about seeing someone being shunned for so long find something greater than blank, cruel stares. Yet, at the same time, I was too naive in the anime world. I had no way to compare such things as story, art, sound, etc. Naruto was the best because it was the only one. Surprisingly, as I ventured into less well-known anime, my view of Naruto became a bit more critical. My initial amateur eyes that adored that yellow-haired boy and his adventures judged the not-so-amazing art, the lack of intense emotional appeal or response, and its amount of fillers (there are quite a few). The fact that Naruto was one of the so-called ""Big Three"" was enough for me; that in itself shot its rank up my list. That is, until I began to realize maybe it's so popular because it's quite an easy anime to accept? I am still not sure, but I do not want to deny it has been a good enough anime for me. Story: 7/10 Just from the synopsis alone, anyone should be able to realize the story will have at least some depth in it. Beneath the usual light and comical air Naruto tends to bring on screen is a darker secret that he tries his best to hide his pain and loneliness. That already makes a powerful story, something many viewers can watch and learn from. Naruto teaches many lessons, especially about not giving up. Perhaps what makes it so popular is Naruto's continuous drive to find acceptance. So much of the anime revolves around that goal, but that then makes so much of it quite amazing. I may be slightly judgmental here, but given the black/white nature of Naruto, there seems to be a bit of a skew. It is easy for the anime to be easygoing, but it seems to need something sad in order to develop its other side. That seems to be quite ironic because Naruto's life for a long time was one without friends and light. At the same time, I would understand it because in a way Naruto is trying to move on, but it just feels like the pain and suffering endured in the past is forced by their current circumstances (if that even made sense). Art: 6/10 I realize if I reviewed this anime years ago when I first watched it, I would probably give it a 9 or 10. The art was not heavenly, the battles were not that epic (some were), and sometimes it just seems the artists did not put too much effort in. To summarize, I've seen better. Sound: 7/10 Generally when I watch anime, I do not pay too much attention to music, but it does heighten certain feelings when played in the right time. Naruto does a good job, especially during moments of sadness. Those for me stand out the most. For the rest of the moments, though, the music just blends in. It is not particularly super, but not bad either. Character: 7/10 Character development is pretty good. A lot of time is spent on main characters' pasts which add depth and understanding. Although not everybody gets their fair share on the spotlight, enough is given and explained. Enjoyment: 6/10 I personally enjoy deep plots. Naruto had a focus on that, with its emphasis on Naruto's past suffering and pain, but at the same time the amount of deviation from its original standpoint somewhat irritated me. In other words, I didn't really like all of the fillers. Sometimes they provided more background, which was nice, but usually they were out-of-the-blue and did nothing to the storyline at all. Overall: 7/10 Maybe if Naruto was the 5th anime I watched and not the 1st, it would have been ranked lower. However, I feel the beauty of this anime comes from its huge popularity. It's widely known throughout the world (probably), and that's what makes it unique. Sure it is not the best anime out there, but it does deserve some respect for being so... natural. It's one of the most natural anime out there. Give it a shot.",7,Recommended,"Jul 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b299e786fb,8
"First time i watched Naruto i did not like it. Second time i did not like it but since all the people praised it for being so good i saw 5 episodes of it. Before that i didnt even got through the 1. And i liked it. The story takes place in an alternitive world where ninjas exist. And you will be following Naruto and his life as an ninja. He is an 12 year old kid who graduates from the ninja acadmey at the first episode and so his the journey begins with Uchiha Sasuke and Sakura Haruno as Team 7. If you like the system, world etc you will love this serie, even if youre not a fan of the main charachter. The best thing about Naruto is the story and charachters. You will feel sympathy for almost everyone and at some point you might even cry. The music is also a great thing. Toshiro Masuda who composed the soundtrack is godlike. You will be listening to the soundtrack the rest of your life after this. The first 135 episodes are godlike. Even tho they did censored some things its still awsome but after that the rest is just fillers. Then there is Shippuuden, Its a continue of Naruto when is older but they thought of Naruto as a way to make money so the Anime went down a bit. But the Shippuuden manga is even better then the first 135 episodes.",10,Recommended,"May 12, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e174891773,8
"So.... Naruto. I don't really know why I'm writing this review as my first review, there are plenty already, and I don't particularly care about the series... I guess it's one of those whims. Let's move on to the review then, I'll try to keep it short. And btw, I'm writing the review for the whole Naruto series, including Shippuden and the rest. Naruto is without any shred of doubt, the most popular anime outside Japan today. Completely surpassed any high Pokemon, Dragon Ball or Yu-gi-oh ever achieved, the whole world all of a sudden just can't have enough ninjas. These are all for a good reason, the anime completely blew most American cartoon in term of maturity, art quality, story and bgm, yet somehow keep it simple enough for kids to love. It didn't deliberately dumb itself down as if mocking 12+ years old kids brain size, yet not twisted enough to ruin an 8 years old fantasies and innocence. Suddenly kids are treated to a cartoon that not only gets you laughing but also complex and heart rending. Now the question is, why did I only gave the anime a 6 if it is that good? Because ultimately, this anime is a kids stories disguised as something mature. And as a mid-20s seasoned anime enthusiast (read: otaku), it's just hard for me to find this engaging. Here's the complete breakdown: Plot (5) - Debatable: Why debatable? Because maybe for younger audience, this was a masterpiece, who knows? But for me, the protracted episodes length, the out of place fillers that keeps contradicting the canon, the almost stale twists in every corner of the plot only to be replaced by yet another twists. 5 is generous. Art (5): Completely mediocre, barely average (thus the 5). Understandable since the anime is made to be long running, but it doesn't erase the fact that the art quality is lacking compared to other shorter series from the same time. Sound (7.5): As with other popular JUMP's anime such as One Piece, Bleach, Beelzebub, etc. the op and ed were typically beautiful, picked from various famous contemporary j-pop/rock. The in-anime BGM was nothing special. Chara (6) - Debatable: Nothing special, typical of shonen series. Sasuke's breakthrough as one of the most likeable antagonist is pretty notable, as his duality existence with Naruto had been the driving force of this series since the time skip. Enjoyment/Overall (6) - Debatable: It was pretty enjoyable at first, especially back at the time when I still don't mind watching anime with more than 50 episodes. But after 100+ episodes, with each episodes so protracted, with not much happening, I decided to drop the anime and just read the manga. This is not isolated to only Naruto, but I always find that anime adaptation of the manga tend to move really slowly and less enjoyable than the manga, especially if it's JUMP's. So that's my review and I just want to leave a few words, for all of you so called 'Narutards', Naruto is not the best anime ever, it was not even close and never will be. It was good, and that's it. For trolls and haters, No, the anime is not as bad as you make it to be.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 4, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8361d72689,8
"Ok, first things first. Im a girl. I'm more of a shoujo person. And at first I thought Naruto was stupid. I like animes like Ouran High school or Fruits Basket, But even if you are like me and you don't like action, let me tell you this: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!! After watching the first ten episodes I fell in love with it. And in a month, I'm already done with the first season of Naruto (220 episodes) and now waiting for the 336th episode of Naruto Shippuuden to be released. The art isn't bad, and I just love the characters. Naruto is really really funny, you have to make sure you go take a piss before you watch an episode. I may make it sound very calm, but the author did a really really good job at blending blood, fighting, comedy, and a tiny bit of love in it. There are a lot of morals, like ""never give up"". It's not too confusing to understand all the concepts of the shinobi. I really really enjoyed the story and the characters. A MUST WATCH FOR GUYS AND GIRLS EVEN!!!

"When this show started off I loved it. I loved every episode, the action was great, and it had some interesting story development. But then the show went on and as it went I spiraled down fast. Naruto himself got annoying, Sakura got frustratingly moany about Sauske, and Sauske turned out to be an arse. But the thing that really turned me off to the show fastest was the story line and how they were trying to get that laugh, and mostly just pandering to the age group that finds fart jokes funny. It got really irksome when an entire mission/story ark gets completely destroyed when Naruto rips one (I'm looking at you Bikochu Beetle). The show still has some amazing fight sequences, and the overall concept shows that it could have been an amazing anime, if it had only decided to step out of the kiddy grades and not try to make us laugh at lame humor.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_749f014923,8
"People who complain about fillers and things dragging out are just clueless to the times this was animated in. Naruto was animated between 2002 and 2007. It was animated on a weekly basis because the Manga was amazing and very popular. The best part of the anime is the writing, the music, and the subbed voice acting. If you watch Naruto and compare it to modern anime that's just stupid because nowadays they have so much more technology to help with the animation and they often take year long breaks to animate new seasons while they never really did that with Naruto. It's also really easy to skip the fillers if you really want, but they are also great to watch after you finish the series. The fillers give the other characters outside the main cast some time to shine and it gives people who read the manga some new things to see. I see people writing essays about how long the fillers drag on when they didn't even watch it when it aired. That was the real pain for us. Waiting for the plot to continue while the fillers were going was rough for most people who were watching back then, but it was because the Manga was still being written and Shonen wanted to keep Naruto going as it was one of the big 3 (Naruto, One Piece , Bleach) for a long time. Looking back at it I appreciate the fillers and prefer that to waiting years for the next season with no content in-between.

I prefer to think of it as misplaced OVA material. Fillers aside, I find this an awesome series, very well constructed, mixing great battle intensity with intricate major and side plots, and placing focus on character development. Only in its last arc does it drag for too long, and for a while it becomes almost arcade like - battle after battle after battle. Story stays on hold for a while, and for that reason it earns no perfect score - indeed, I almost rated it with an 8, but because the previous arcs were so great, a 9 should be fair.",9,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a48c14af40,8
"Unlike most Naruto fans, I didn't grow up watching it. I never had some kind of emotional connection with it. It was only recently that I decided to watch it, and that was only because everyone was talking about how good it was and blah blah blah. Now, almost a year after I finished the show, Naruto is one of the few anime that I believe is truly outstanding! Don't be scared by the 720 episodes of the franchise. It seems a lot, but it isn't. Watching the first 10-20 episodes of the series didn't give me a different impression; it was just another anime about ninja, I thought! When the actual plot began, I couldn't get myself away from the screen. It was so interesting that I just couldn't help but wanting to know what was going to happen next! But why is Naruto so good? Let's start with the story. It's appears to be pretty simple! The story is set in an alternative world where ninjas exist. It's an easy and believable concept that you don't have to think to much about. Then we have the characters! There are so many characters in the Naruto series, but each of them is so unique, that I can remember everyone's names AND surnames. The main character, Naruto, is not perfect, which is something that makes the series even better. Throughout the series we see his flaws, his troubles, his actions and we also see him grow up and change into a better person. He is not a kid who has a perfect life and wants to be a hero. He has a goal, and a reason for that goal. All that make Naruto's character more realistic and more relatable. Then we have the Antihero of the series, Sasuke. Sasuke is the exact opposite of Naruto, and at the same time, they are so alike. Sasuke's character is also not perfect. He himself has many flaws and has made many mistakes throughout the series. But what truly makes him a good character is that he ALSO has a reason for his actions. I can't write any of the details because I'm trying not to spoil anything. Moving on to the soundtrack. I am a soundtrack lover. Naruto's soundtrack is unlike anything you have ever heard before. It combines traditional Asian instruments with modern rhythms. The result of that was outstanding. And if you become a fan of this series, some of these soundtracks will stick in your brain for life and whenever you hear it, you'll feel nostalgic. Next we have the Art. Naruto is not a recent anime, so don't expect the highest quality. But to tell you the truth, that didn't matter. At least not to me. I enjoyed the show despite that. Besides, the quality gets better in Shippuden. Finally, the most important feature of not just the show, but the entire franchise, are the hidden meanings and messages it has about life. I often find myself following the examples that Naruto characters set in the series. Overall, I think that the Naruto franchise is a hidden gem among the anime world, and I highly recommend it. It doesn't matter how old you are! I plan to watch it again one day, with my kids. One thing is for certain; Naruto will always have a special place in my heart!",10,Recommended,"Sep 9, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ae9a7fddd5,8
"Nostalgia is probably pumping up my ratings here haha. Naruto (excluding fillers, please if you're gonna watch skip them because this is a long ass series and they don't really add anything to the story in my opinion) is a really good story when it starts out. As a shounen genre type thing I really liked the exploration of darker themes with ultimately good messages. The character development is interesting, the story is engaging, and it it gives you characters to root for. It can be funny, it can be sad. It's enjoyable and a really common gate way anime. That being said it was originally made for younger audiences and is by no means a true masterpiece of any kind. If you look too much into it you're gonna find a ton of plot holes (and this increases doubly in Shippuden and x100 for anything post that) so enjoy it for what it is.

"This review contain minor spoilers Naruto is the very first manga I have seen and I think it's time for me to give an objective review of the serie. And despite many people gave Naruto low scores, I'll explain why I give it a 9. Story: 8 First of all, if you want to enjoy Naruto, skip all the fillers, they are not part of the story and it won't hurt to skip them. The story of naruto is outstanding considering it is one of the first long shounen series out there. I will not tell the story in detail but it is basically about main character naruto's path to prove himself and defend his friendship with sasuke. If you have seen a lot of shounen animes, then you would probably realise that many other animes have their story background or several arcs based on Naruto, Boku no hero academy' tournament arc and attack on titan's background of a titan broke into nine pieces. I would say that naruto may not have the best plot considering all the animes that came out after it, but it is definitely one of the best when it was airing. Please do consider this while rating it. Apart from that, most of the arcs in Naruto are super exciting, I will not spoil here, but if you consider Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden as a whole, you will realize that the whole story is very well structured. Art: 6 I gave Naruto's art 6 because again, at the same time you are saying about contemporary anime's great animation, please do bear in mind that Naruto came out several years ago, it is simply not fair to compare Naruto's art to other animes that came out decades after. Though I have to admit that from contemporary perspective, naruto's art is not good. If you really can't bear the animation, I suggest you read the manga instead, it is much better and I would not recommend you to drop the serie just because of animation. Sound: 9 I do like all the voice actors. Naruto's OPs are also fantastic, no need to explain more. Character: 10 Now this is the best part of Naruto in my opinion. Though Naruto is a typical protagonist, hot-blooded, works hard and has some gifts given to him, but you could see his change from the begining to the end, the way he viewed friendship and responsibility. Sasuke, in my opinion, is a very -well built character, all of his actions are reasonable, and I don't understand why people are saying they don't understand sasuke's change from a revenger to Naruto's ally, it is probably because they just did not pay much attention to the story, as someone who finished all the manga and anime about Naruto, I promise you what they are saying are not the case. Side characters are also great, particularly members of the Akatsuki; now these are typical example of good villains, they don't do ""evil"" for the sake of doing evil, but rather have their complex mindset and way of viewing the world. Each of them carries a different dream like love, peace, childhood, etc. It sometimes makes you question whether or not they are the evil. Enjoyment: 10 I definitely enjoyed the serie, but if you don't insist on watching animes I would rather recommend you to read manga instead, it is much more enjoyable. Overal: 9 Great anime, but received many unjust ratings just because fillers and aged animation, which in my opinion, are just unfair to Naruto",7,Recommended,"Dec 15, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e07e8faee6,8
"So ever since I started watching Naruto - I've read the manga, and only recently decided to give the anime a go - I've been, for some reason, unconsciously comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin - my all-time favourite manga. After the first episode of Naruto, I gave the show an 8. It was good. I'll give you that. The majority of anime don't get any more than a 6 from me usually. Shingeki no Kyojin, after the first episode, also got an eight. But I only changed that 8 to a 9 after the tenth Naruto episode, while Shingeki no Kyojin's eight turned into an immediate 10 after the second episode. Now, why is that? I'll try and explain. Firstly: sfx and music. The atmosphere set up in Shingeki no Kyojin by the music accompaniments is absolutely flawless. In Naruto, I find that those things aren't as good. Some of the sfx and music are cliché. A lot of the 'touching' moments are filmed in such a terrible way that I couldn't decide if the show-makers intended us to understand it an a parodied way or a serious way. Maybe that's just me. But oh well, we all have our personal opinions. Secondly: characters. This may be because I've read the manga previously, but I feel that the characters in Naruto, from the very first episodes of the manga, are very predictable, excepting a few choice moments. In SNK, there is no such thing. Every new development is a surprise. Every twist, every turn of the wrist and every trip decision comes as a complete shock. Thirdly: direction of plot. One of the first things we hear Naruto say is that he wants to become the next Hokage. Since the show is named after him, we can safely assume, even from the first episode, that he will surmount all the coming obstacles and ascend to the position of Godaime no matter what obstacles lie in his path. I like the show, I really do. BUT THAT'S BORING. I don't like 'predictable' things - one of the reasons I prefer Shingeki no Kyojin. With SNK's plot, and with its developments, we have no idea whether or not killing the titans will ever be achieved. The main character's - Eren's - goal is to discover the outside world, and to do that he has to destroy the titans. He has no choice in the matter. It's that or getting killed. But with the number of deaths within the main characters and supporting characters, we could just as well safely assume that he'll get killed himself before he can even find out what the heck it was that his father left in his basement. Hell, even as I speak, Eren is being held captive in some rich guy's basement and about to be eaten by one of his best friends. And there seems to be no possible way out of it. A lot of the fans agree that it's possible he - the main character - will die. Naruto dying? Not possible. Never even considered. There can be no NARUTO without Naruto. Fourthly: this last one is personal taste, but I tend to prefer really serious mangas/animes with very few comic relief (Sacha and Connie are two of the only comic relief characters in SNK, while ALL of Naruto's characters provide comic relief), heavy plot, manipulations, intrigues, and whatnot. I find that Naruto (the show, not the character, because Naruto Uzumaki is one of the characters I relate to the most in any anime) has TOO much comic relief, and takes TONNES away from the beauty and intensity that could be the show. There's more, but I can't think how to put it into words. I tried my best not to give any SNK spoilers. No names. Hope this is helpful to anyone who's been thinking the same thing or was looking for a comparison of the two. If you want to contact me to talk about this, or for any other reason, actually, then do! I'd be glad to meet someone new.",9,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d21e35ed1b,8
"Pros: everything, but only up to about the first 50 episodes (plus the clashes between the 3 legendary shinobidos later on) Cons: everything since then The anime is well viewed and understood. It thus does not require synoptic reviews. I'll just share some personal experience with the anime. I started watching the series a lot later than most people, but once I started, I had no trouble comprehending the frenzies my friends would have about the series -- a tale of ninja and their mysterious techniques (grown up in China, I love all things elemental-related when it comes to magics and fantasies), a depiction of the hierarchy and conflicts in the Japanese Warring era, and a ballard of growing-up with tears, efforts and friendship. It was an awesome escape from the real world, with either new shinobido techniques or new character stories to reveal every episode-- there is always mystery, suspension, and action. However, (as with all things, there has to be a ""however""), that's only up to about 60 episodes, if I recall right. After that, the series is reduced to episodic missions that do not further the storyline or introduce any new techniques. The motifs of each small story are boring and blank at best. The whole series simply turned into a repetitive, dungeon-ish, adventure anime probably only geared for grade-schoolers. Just to name one of its vice, it occurs in every single episode that some character, in a super intensive, emergent and often life-threatening situation (as depicted by the character's monologue anyway), would somehow freeze and take ages to make the simplest decision or the most obvious tactical observation -- as if the viewers all have IQ of none when viewing this series. What does the anime itself do during all these pauses? About 7 seconds zooming in on the same frame. And then? Another 7 seconds zooming out! If not longer!! It's almost sever to the point that I can barely enjoy the episodes as animations but instead voiced CG drama. I gave up after a few episodes of those, obviously. I would revisit the series occasionally and only receive disappointment - not to anybody's surprise. Hence, my overall rating -> 3/10, in a protest against the inattention of the producer to the later part of the series, while the partial ratings remain high, in a tribute to the series' quickly-diminished potential. EDIT: Unlike normal rating, the word clause remains neutral/positive until the score is lower to as bad as 3 when writing a comment -> partly the reasons for the low score.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 4, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2c5ed85e15,8

"Believe in the Naruto that believes in you... that’s what Kamina said at least, right? Naruto is iconic. With all the Naruto-running, cropped pictures of Sasuke being choked, and the forgotten classic of “Tobi is a good boy” memes that have laced the Internet, this the Digital Age is not without its Naruto influence and perhaps even bigger to people today than what Dragon Ball was to the generation prior. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least 10% of all zoomers have seen some form of Naruto in their life too. It’s an anime that deserves to be experienced. If it wasn’t already apparent, I love Naruto. Naruto was one of the first anime I remember watching where I was aware what I was watching was just that. I would even credit the show for lifting my fascination for Japan and all things anime off the ground too. Going from staying up late with friends to catch the latest weekly episode on Toonami, to going to the Naruto website to catch the latest subbed episode, to reading the manga, and rewatching the show over and over again as the years went on. But over those years I’ve slowly become disillusioned with the it all; Naruto quickly became one of the more contentious shows I’ve groan to know. I have to say though, from the get go, what I appreciated about Naruto conceptually, ever since I first tuned into the show, was how it managed to subvert viewers through its premise. Knowing its creator, Masashi Kishimoto, originally had in mind to write his now highly-acclaimed, modern classic manga as a story that happened to revolve around shinobi arts as a vehicle to depict the value of friendship, it’s incredible in the amount of world building put into the it all, stringing together all sorts of East-Asian lore, mythology, and history to make up much of the inspiration. Instead of mercenaries set in a traditional, Edo-period Japan, we instead get a group of teenagers graduating from an academy to achieve their genin status depicted in a brand new ninja universe. All of that in mind, I’d go as far to say the world in Naruto is one of my favorites in any show. That brief mention about teenagers attending an academy? That’s only relevant for the first three episodes — arguably one. It’s funny how often I remember Naruto as a show about students attending a ninja academy when it’s not even near the core of the show itself. Instead we have students broken up into squads of four, consisting of three just-graduated genin and one jonin, the highest rank of shinobi, and it’s this dynamic we will be used to. Having the show revolve around a squad and not a room full of students at a school allows for more freedom in the story for our characters to move and a better chance for us to learn about the world through action. Like most shounen, action anime/manga, there is a power system in Naruto: chakra. Chakra is energy stored in all shinobi for which they utilize it through intense rigorous training and allows them to active various forms of jutsu. This power system, although better thought up compared to Dragon Ball, but one that’s not as well managed or balanced as Hunter X Hunter. More on that later. The different jutsu shinobi can learn and use include the three basics: ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. There are also other, specific techniques like fuinjutsu which is a sealing style of jutsu meant to lock or unlock words, people, or chakra amongst other things into scrolls and paper tags. There are even techniques only specific individuals can utilize, being kekkei genkai. These are hidden techniques known only to specific clans or otherwise other passed down through their bloodline. One such example is doujutsu, an “eye” ability that, if they possess the correct eyes, can perform unimaginable abilities. Having chakra, as well as the focus, allows a shinobi to walk up walls and on water. There is a huge rabbit hole of information regarding the different shinobi arts and reading about it online is just as interesting as watching ten show itself, if not more. However, the gripe I have about this system is there isn’t any clear way distinctly knowing how much chakra someone has or how much is used up. Sometimes you’ll see characters fatigued or will straight up say they’ve used up all their chakra but you’ll find that any character can get around this through convenience or outside circumstance. No more chakra to use on your opponent? No problem, just run out of the way, perfectly throw a target, or have a neighboring ally save you from harm. If all else fails, just give it a little bit of time and you’ll suddenly regain enough chakra to use soon after. Jutsu get pretty ridiculous from time to time too. Although not nearly as bad as the power creep would get in Shippuden, moments where Kakashi and Zabuza, an incredibly skilled mercenary and Jonin that’s said to be just as powerful as Kakashi, are shown making hand signs, lasting around 10 seconds or so to do, in order to summon two giant dragons made from water out of a nearby lake, and that’s the only time you see a sequence as detailed as that. Every time characters do hand signs, time is not nearly as spent on the action and newly graduated Genin are able to do this while fighting off the enemy. Sure these are not just teenagers but ones that have gone through years of training to be able to do any of this, but it downplays the nature of battling with jutsus and sooner than later you find nearly every single fight is primarily a battle with magical powers. Again, thankfully this isn’t so much a problem in the OG Naruto show as it is in Shippuden, but the leniency of not having a tighter grip on the power system and the powers that come from it create too much risk for something out of control. Our main cast consists of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, and for sake of brevity will focus more on than their importance’s to the show itself. The characters themselves, although not anywhere near the most original I’ve seen (especially for a shounen), share a strong distinction from the other, complementing each other’s strengths. The primary colors are often paired with green, for a fourth color like in the Opponent Process theory, and our main cast members all distinctly fit into each color (with a secondary color to boot), setting them apart easily when together and allowing room for their personalities to shine more. Naruto has both yellow and orange to emphasize hope, energy, and a bright future. Sasuke has a deep blue and black to contrast Naruto especially as well as show his dark and dejected past. Sakura having red and pink to represent the passion and love she bears. And Kakashi in a green and white which tells us how calm and focused he is towards his life and his students. It’s a simple yet effective way of storytelling, further preparing us for who shares the screen. The side characters to any show are only as strong as their mains and thankfully this show has plenty of good ones. There are several other squads that graduated from the same academy Naruto came from and each have their own distinct personalities as a squad. Unfortunately, every character outside of the main four have muted color schemes but up close you’ll notice their cool individual designs. Each character has an unmistakable style or “gimmick” to them and it makes for interesting scenarios for when they’re on the battlefield. Growing up and entering middle school around the time I was first watching Naruto, I fell in love with most of the characters found. I was enamored with their dynamics and interaction both in and outside a fight. It was like having a awkward, fogged up view of what being a teenager could be like... only without the ninja stuff. What’s unfortunate is those characters I loved would only appear for a certain number of episodes and then later, when that arc would end, would never be seen again until the next arc, if that (sorry Ten-Ten fans). As hopeful as one could be, not every side character is given the same treatment as another. Some are treated like temporary main characters, others barely have any lines. It’s as if Kishimoto doesn’t know what to do with them aside from being window dressing, with more screen time given to some in some of the ops and eds rather than the actual episodes (again, sorry Ten-Ten fans). Something Naruto does well though is how they handle their arcs. They are recognizable from each other and last for a long while, so unfortunately if an arc doesn’t excite you, it can come off like a drag sitting through it. Naruto, for better or worse, has two really great arcs, The Chunin Exam arc and The Retrieval arc. Every arc Kishimoto creates can be split into sections, which make for an exceptional way of handling them, but the two in reference are well beloved by fans for good reason, as they do an exceptional job in its overall content and refreshing narratives compared to some other long-running shows. I’ll admit that getting through some arcs feel a little “meh” than others, but I’d argue they at least hold a lot of significance and maintain an identity all in itself and the progress you see Naruto and co. go through. All in all, it’s a net positive in the arc department. Now, I gotta focus on the negatives, because if there is something I think Naruto doesn’t get enough flack for is its pacing. Naruto has filler, an ass load of it, but even during canonical episodes you will witness poor pacing that cuts the seams in the production schedule. Showing anyone this show, at this day of age, can be cringe inducing. Having to sit their with your significant other as you watch all the characters stand around for nearly a minute as the scene pans around, closes in on everyone’s reactions, and zooms in on a single still shout of the “action” itself. Hearing a chuckle accidentally release from a confused viewer, I am reminded we are watching mediocrity and not something with proper heart and creativity put in. If the show isn’t randomly inserting filler in the middle of an arc, then it is bogging down the episode by stretching out its moments, contributing to the horrid pacing. Not every episode is like this and several fights in here I’d argue are among some of the best fights in anime ever, but that’s only a fraction of what makes up the bulk of this show. I mentioned it before, but Naruto is plagued with its filler content. If you’re wanting to pick this show up, just know it is quite the undertaking. I already mentioned one of the shows to precede Naruto, being Shippuden, but the other is Boruto, which is a spin-off taking place after the events of Shippuden, so to get the complete Naruto animated experience you not only will have to complete 220 episodes from here, 500 episodes of Shippuden, maybe the 11 films sprinkled here and there, and the currently airing Boruto: the Next Generation which is sitting at 185+ episodes as of this writing. I’d honestly pit a good argument that it’s more of a journey getting through all the show than our titular character has ever experienced. So, how much filler are we talking here? Well, firstly, I will admit that I too, sometimes, will not give my full attention to a show for every single moment it graces my screen. This is mostly due to the lack of time I have to enjoy to myself outside of when I’m working and would rather indulge in multiple outlets. So the idea of someone not committing to giving their full attention to the filler in Naruto is understandable, but it’s still questionable. If you consider the 720 episodes of Naruto and Shippuden combined, there are 425 episodes that are canon to the manga. That’s 59.03% that is actually related to the story being driven. Just slightly over half of the animated television material is worth consideration of being absolutely crucial in the eyes of many fans. Something that’s far more common than I expected for new fans of the show to do is follow a PDF, usually one found somewhere online, that list the different episodes dedicated to being filler, and skip those episodes. And that’s the problem. If a show has way too much filler that you’re willing to skip, perhaps that says a lot about the product itself or maybe the viewers that skip it all without question are hesitant to admit the show’s shortcomings. Perhaps that overall rating isn’t deserved? Hmm.. I’m actually a fan of filler. For the most part I’ve never really minded it before or after knowing whenever I’ve watched any too. Naruto, for a majority of the time, has some good filler. There is some bad filler, in fact, literally the second episode in the series is a filler episode. That episode is a bad and annoying episode, and while we are at it, if you’re about skipping episodes, you can probably just skip the first two episodes as the third episode makes for an amazing pilot episode and is one of my absolute favorites in the series, but that’s neither here nor there. Many that have watched the filler with agree that the episode involving Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke trying to see what’s under Kakashi’s mask is an example of good filler. Although I personally don’t care for it, as it’s a bit too slapstick and tonally separate from much of the show, it’s at least a bit of proof that there is value in watching them. The Land of Tea and Land of Rice Patties arcs are two of my favorite sets of filler episodes that I think every fan should watch. Of course, many will still skip the filler as it’s a matter of principle and finishing the show as quickly as they can without being bogged down by events that are inconsequential regardless of the entertainment value. The art is both and hit and a miss. For the time it looked pretty good, but nothing stellar. Watching it now I’m able to notice more of the shortcuts the animators made when producing the show. Kishimoto has even expressed concern over his drawing abilities over time when illustrating. The show does have its fair share of sakuga, particularly in certain high stakes moments in anticipated fight scenes. But if there is one thing every Naruto fan CAN agree with it’s that Naruto has some of the best collection of ops and eds on the market. To me, Naruto felt like it was always trying to one up itself and change its theme music to not just keep us in tune for when a new arc/section of the show begins and ends, but just because it could. Naruto had the clout to justify its seemingly rapid output of ops and eds and each one sticks with you in some way. You could probably learn a lot about a person judging solely on which Naruto op and ed they favorite the most. Looking into everything, I’ll admit this show can be a fun ride and not even me at my most cynical, not even me after binging Neon Genesis followed by Angel’s Egg, not even me with a partner at my side could intellectually tear this Show down by saying it’s not fun. Because Naruto can be fun to watch. It’s a show you can easily get lost in. I didn’t want to focus on any spoilers but there’s plenty to nitpick there, but I can still understand why someone could like the show regardless. As essential this show is to experience, at this point in my life, if pacing/filler is an issue for you I cannot in good conscience recommend someone sit through at this show. Again, I believe it’s essential but you’d be better off lurking online for information regarding the show rather than be disappointed trying to commit to the entire thing. If you decide to check it out and watch a few episodes , I think you’ll know right away if you’re going to like this show and want to stick with it in the long run.

"I only recently got into anime, and so had the benefit of doing some research before watching the first series of Naruto. I was able to skip all of the filler episodes, and believe me, nearly 50% of the anime is filler. So, even though I said above that I've seen all 220 episodes, I've really only watched the canon episodes and a few of the recommended fillers. Even so, Naruto was one of those shows that needed to grow on me. Having previously watched Hunter x Hunter, it took me until after the Ninja Test arc to really get into it because so much of it reminded me of Hunter x Hunter. Nevertheless, once the two ""test"" arcs parted ways I felt Naruto better eased into its own thing. I have the character mark an 8 because when I began the show I only saw Naruto as a whiny brat, but by the end his character really grew on me. Pacing might be a bit slow for some, but I'm one of those people who enjoy back stories and getting to know characters better. For this reason I still have a few filler ""arcs"" that I've heard were good and might want to go back and watch. In the end, I thought the series was highly enjoyable to watch. I originally was hesitant to only watch the canon episodes, but having done so I'm glad I did. There are a number of websites that list these. Since the show is up in part on Netflix and other streaming avenues, I would also recommend finding the wiki on how the episodes divide into arcs. This helped me get a sense of direction when watching.",8,Recommended,"May 21, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7e4eeb2977,8

"Like is the case for many people, Naruto was one of the first anime that I watched. And like a lot of people who hadn't seen much to compare it with, I loved it! But I grew up with Naruto and as time passed, I did find plenty wrong with it. Now it's a show that I like to make fun of out of love, like an old friend. So with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get to my actual thoughts on it. Naruto is seen as one of the most overrated series of all time because to any seasoned anime viewer, it IS average. The artwork can seem subpar, the shear number of filler episodes is terrifying, and certain dub voices can make you cringe. However, there are a few qualities that do make the series special. Not all of the music is great, but there are a few songs that you can't help but be moved by. And with the dozens of songs, you'll never get bored of hearing the same thing. Secondly, there's a great balance between plot, action, and fun time (granted, the humor isn't great, but hey, there's still action and drama, right?). And once you finish wading through the sea of filler, there are the moments that make it all worth it. But sometimes it does feel like work to get to those points, so if you're the type who would prefer an anime that doesn't hold back and jumps straight into an intense storyline, Naruto isn't for you. But if you enjoy a good long show that slowly develops lovable characters, is in no particular hurry to get where it's going (but it will get there), or just want to see an old classic, Naruto might be perfect for you. Personally, I may have to watch it again soon myself. After all, this show really did change my childhood and probably made me a better person. I hope it can do the same for everyone else.",8,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_89be956af7,8
"Everyone makes Naruto out to be the most beginner anime out there; you can't watch anything until you've finished Naruto. While it is an older anime, and it isn't a bad anime, there are many things about Naruto that can be hard to follow, lame, or just cliche. Naruto comes along to be one of the greatest anime in existence - but I have to disagree. Like many of us here, we can agree that Naruto is a good anime... but it is a far cry from masterpiece. I have not finished all of Naruto, but I have watched most of it. I have an idea on how the rest of the anime will run. Story (6) For those of you who read the summary, this anime is about a young male, Naruto Uzumaki, who wants to surpass the Hokage, or leader of the Leaf Village, through training and hard work as a Shinobi (ninja). It was one of things that had originally drew me into this anime. It seemed incredibly original, and it actually is. Many well-detailed plot twists, interesting plot at times, and moments of triumph reign this anime supreme. But that's only a small part of the anime outside of the filler episodes that go through it. The original story of Naruto does sound very nice... it's about Naruto who wants to be Hokage. But the anime dwells further and further away from Naruto's dream that it starts showing up less in the main episodes and starts making a new home inside of the filler episodes, where you can watch literal hours of Naruto trying to learn something, fail, and then do something ""spectacular"" or ""creative"" to master a technique. I kid you not, it's one of the most boring things to watch in an anime... ever. As I mentioned before, the plot about Naruto begins to fade and shed new light on anime all-time favorite character Sasuke Uchiha, the last of the Uchiha clan, who survived a massacre not too long before the events of the anime, and when he wants revenge on a certain man. This is a great side-plot, but the thing that bugs me the most is that many episodes focus on Sasuke's dark desire to bring his family the justice they deserve. I believe several people already pointed it out in other reviews... You being watching many filler Naruto scenes, and many plot-ridden Sasuke scenes. Like I said, for the most part, story's really nice. But the amount of filler and add-ons were enough to make four different Naruto mini-series called Sasuke, Naruto Training, Goofy Garbage, and Boring Garbage. Art (8) Graphics are at the best an 8. The character designs were key in my approval of the art style, but the animation flunked some times and characters could be unrecognizable in combat unless they were the focus of the camera. The art style, in my opinion, while old - looks very clean and nice, and I find it to be very creative and appealing to look at, even if it lacks detail in far-ranged shots. Again, character design was cool. Kakashi looks wonderful and like a true ninja and the members of the Akatsuki are pretty unique. Sound (8) Some music is good, other parts, not good. The opening songs in Naruto are very annoying and forgettable, as I found myself reaching for my remote to skip ahead of it and try not the die from ear blood loss. I don't know how others feel about the openings, but personally, I find all of them to be very horrible. Sound effects used are comical and had me laughing a lot at times. Naruto's blissful stress and irritation can be seen entirely through the noise each character makes when they are in such states of distaste. Especially Sasuke. Snotty little boy. Character (9) Characters are my favorite things in Naruto. While they can be repetitive and lack originality, which is why I give this section a 9 over a 10, most of the people in this are very interesting and make memorable moments through-out the anime, even Rock Lee, who had me scared at night thinking about that bowl cut and perfectly round eyes. Most characters have their flaws and evil sides, which is what makes for a truly interesting character, even Naruto, who has the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside of him, an aspect that makes the Hidden Leaf Village have large urges against him. Enjoyment (7) Story is good, lots of humor added in there, enjoyable characters, and generally interesting action sequences are what make this have a higher rating. However, even with the pros listed above, Naruto has many moments of filler episodes, fights that last for 10+ episodes, and events that happen in the fillers that had me pulling my teeth out. I get that it's not necessary to watch filler episodes, but it still exists. Very hard to enjoy watching repetitive things happen during the course of Naruto's training, especially when he is with Pervy Sage (Jiraiya). So I give this a 7. Overall (7) To round this off, Naruto isn't a bad anime. It's definitely one someone should hit if they haven't already, but don't expect your socks to be flying off during the events of what happen in this anime. This anime is good - but it isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. If you have the time to be sitting through 200+ episodes, go ahead and watch this, and be sure to skip the filler episodes unless you want to be bald from tearing your hair out.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a4cbbd856e,8
"While not to everyone's tastes, I personally thought this anime was amazing. Granted, it's one of those types of anime that you might think of as more of a cartoon than an anime. Very well designed characters that really evolve and change in dramatic, noticeable ways. The plot left me twisting in my seat and biting my nails in anticipation the entire time. You never know what will happen, only that it'll be something amazing and very exciting. Naruto changes everyone he meets and changes everyone's thoughts about practically everything. There isn't much romance, but there are a lot of dynamic characters. Everyone is different. It isn't exactly supernatural, but it is more than natural. Everyone has their own kinds of different powers. Overall, an amazing anime. I simply loved it and have rewatched it no less than two or three times. Plan on watching it again in the future. Probably one of the longest good anime series ever. Can't wait to finish the continuing series, Naruto Shippuden.",9,Recommended,"Dec 22, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c5820b3179,9
"This is the show that got me hooked on anime. STORY: I really loved the beginning of the story, including the training and exam. Since my favorite character of this series is Kakashi, I loved watching Team 7 go on missions and learning new tricks. I didn't like the story towards the end because I am not a fan of Orochimaru, even though he is pretty cool. ART: I loved the art most of the time, but since the art changes so much, there were some art styles I didn't like SOUND: It is known to have one of the best soundtracks of all time for a reason. The music is so good covers of the music get over 90 million views on youtube CHARACTER: As I said above, I love Kakashi. The rest of the characters are great as well (except Sakura) ENJOYMENT: I loved this anime and it felt like 200 episodes were over in a day.

"** I dropped the show at Episode 148 (13 episodes into the fillers) + A vast and interesting ninja world - Terrible pacing (too slow) exploring the world and characters + Likeable characters with different personalities - Sakura + Few characters are developed quite well (Sasuke, Gaara, Neji) - Most characters remain one dimensional - Naruto is the typical bratty shounen MC with exemplary morals + A unique soundtrack that felt perfect - Meh animation, though it is an old show + Chakra, element, jutsu system is interesting and creative. - Most fight scenes are too long, filled with bad dialogue and flashbacks. - Naruto may be weak, he may be a kid but he WILL yell at you and he WILL change your entire mindset. + Chuunin Exam Preliminaries - Fillers I watched 148 episodes in a week so despite its flaws I found Naruto enjoyable.

"Personally it is one of my favorite anime, it was the sixth anime that I saw, I want to clarify this, since many believe that ""Naruto"" is a childhood anime or as one of the first anime that have been seen and for that reason they brand it as overrated, I really don't think that way, I know people who have seen ""Naruto"" in his adulthood, and they really love it. Well having clarified that point I would like to give my opinion about this anime and why you should give it a try. *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This anime considers that it has many good values to teach, the desire to improve yourself, the power of friendship, fight for your dreams and never give up, were the main ones. I also think that it can make you think about life and change your way of thinking. This anime teaches you that the world is not just black and white, there are gray tones, this can be seen referenced a lot in the ""villains"" that are in Naruto, these villains are not bad because yes, they all have a past, something that happened to them and I cause that they now have that way of thinking or being like that, that is why most people can sympathize with these characters. Before I had said that ""NARUTO"" can change your way of thinking and make you reflect about life, which is true, at least in my experience it was like that, I am a very pessimistic person, I give up very easily, I don't have any reason to live or some goal that I want to achieve, this thought has led me to think if it was really important to continue living, it sounds stupid, but that is what happened. I cannot and could not live without having a goal, I needed something to do in my life, but there was nothing, I had already given up, I was only living day to day, I was already planning to commit suicide, I had planned to do it in about 10 more years , I was not happy with my life. But there was something that did not let me, I always had two thoughts that collide with each other, I have a negative side but also a positive one, unfortunately for me the negative was winning. All those thoughts flooded my mind, no matter how hard I tried to get out of that bubble of negativity, it didn't work. Until I remember Naruto, how was it that a child who has a terrible childhood and life, that his parents are dead, I never get to know them, as if that weren't enough they died on the day of his birth, I mean your birthday is Important, one on those dates is generally happy, but knowing that your parents died on the date of your birth must be strong, it must be said that the people, the VILLAGERS, also blamed him (who at that time would be about 6 years old) of the death of the Hokage and the deaths of several more shinobi, all because a man wanted to control the Kyubi and take ""revenge"" against the village, causing the whole village to hate and despise a child who had not the slightest fault of this. But despite that, Naruto never had a grudge towards people, no matter how bad they treat him, he always stays strong. He always looks to the future, he had a goal, a DREAM, which was to become a hokage of his village, with this people would not despise him, but they would value him as he really is, as a person, not as a monster. I have always quite liked happy and pleasant people, his personality was and is perfect for me, I know he is clumsy and quite clueless, but his enthusiasm, his desire to live to fulfill his dreams, is the reason why I admire him so much. That was one of the things that captivated me, his energy, his attitude, his personality, but what I liked the most is that he had a goal, he always had it, this caused in me two feelings, envy and admiration. Envy because he knew that he could never be like him, he could never see the world with the same eyes that he sees them. I could never be happy like him. I could never have a dream, something that I am passionate about to continue with my life. Admiration because I always wanted to be like that, to have his enthusiasm for the things that he is passionate about, the desire to learn new things and that despite having very difficult moments I never give up, it is not an option, no more. I will not give up anymore, I still do not have a goal in my life, but that does not mean that I will lose, I will look for one, I will find something that I am passionate about. That's my goal, it's my ninja path. I will fight for my goals, and when I find a dream I will fight even more. I seriously know I recommend them too much if you are looking for something related to self-improvement, if you are going through a difficult time, especially in adolescence, where I am currently, I know that this process is complicated especially by mood swings or also confusing by hormones, in short. Have you heard of Naruto evangelizing characters in anime? Well let me tell you that Naruto evangelized me, he took me off the path of evil, that it would lead my life to misery if I continued with those mindless thoughts in my head. So I am very grateful to Naruto, I really love this series. SO BOYS AND GIRLS FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS. DO NOT GIVE UP.

"Post Series Depression: ~4.5 (reason after my overall statement) Tear Factor: ~1 - 7 (wide range) Laugh Factor: ~4 - 8 (wide range) Drama Factor: ~5 Character Attachment: ~10 DISCLAIMER: I may have some bias for this show however I will try to keep my review objective. Story: Can vary in quality ranging from amazing to dragging your feet in mud waiting for the next arc to pop up. Additionally ~40% of Naruto is fillers - skipping through fillers may speed up the story as some filler arcs are not necessary/canon. Art: By today's standards - yes - the show is very behind in quality, however by this I mean resolution. The art itself is iconic to its style and is still enjoyable. Sound: Naruto has a very wide range of sounds, which keep you interested, nothing becomes monotonous as you keep listening to the show. However, the show is again old - so you may hear artifacts in the environment sounds, etc.. Characters: This show is known for its characters. Each character is unique and you're more than likely going to find a favorite at some point, or multiple favorites, or your favorites may switch when you meet new people. Almost every character has their own filler arc as well or overall character development (leading into Shippuden as well). however heavy focus is laid into the leaf village. Enjoyment: This show has always been a favorite, I enjoyed re-watching it to make this review. I'd say you'd enjoy it if you're into shounen fighting anime. Overall: Very long series but great too. Skip fillers if you want story only (there are online guides for this). Post Series Depression: Though there is Shippuden after the original series. The mood, the characters, and even the fighting all change along with how the show works. Though it may still be Naruto at its core, something fundamentally changes with Shippuden that makes you miss the original series.",9,Recommended,"Jul 16, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb07c3ab10,9
"Now, first off, I am not going to claim that Naruto is bad. I know a lot of people who would, but I won't. I also will not explain the plot, because once I start it gets hard to stop. What I am going to talk about is how Naruto lost me. It used to hold a very special place in my heart, because it was the anime that got me to look it up on the web, and finally discover what anime was and where to find it. I don't know how long it would have taken for that to happen otherwise, but it was the catalyst. Back in the day I was a diehard Naruto fan. Now, I'm going to start with what is good about the anime. The action is very good, and while I generally prefer One Piece and a couple other anime in that department, it's still well done. The music is very good, and gets you ready for a good time. The best thing, easily, are the characters. The cast is large and there are quite a few stand outs. Rock Lee is a personal favorite, but almost all of the main cast are very well done. Naruto himself is a great protagonist. When they delve into his childhood, it really works. The Zabuza storyline is probably the peak in quality, but the Chunin Exams/Gaara arc is my favorite. The ending fight works very well, though I've seen the same idea done better elsewhere. (Keep that in mind, I'll bring it up again in a couple of days.) Now for the bad. To start off, the problem with the great cast is that the writer has no clue how to focus. As time goes on, he spends less and less time with the initial cast that drew us in, and keeps throwing in new characters, only about one in ten of which are a fifth as good as the original characters. I don't want to spend more time with Sai, I want Hinata! For the anime the filler is atrocious, between Naruto and Shippuden literally a year and a half of filler. Some of it was good, but most was really bad, and because it was filler it was a year and a half where nothing of real importance could happen. Then there's the Sasuke problem. I didn't like Sasuke at first, but by the end of the Zabuza arc he had grown on me. But then the Sasuke retrieval arc reared it's ugly head, and now I can't stand the guy. And it got worse! Every time he's shown up since then he's made me more and more pissed. At one point it started to feel like Sasuke was supposed to be the protagonist, but luckily it switched perspectives again soon after. Plus, after the initial success of Zabuza and Gaara, I haven't liked the villains much. Orochimaru started off cool, but degraded fast. The Akatsuki didn't really impress me. The thing that gets me the worst though is the story. Over time, the plot has become more and more sidetracked and convoluted. It keeps going off-course, and not resolving what it's set up. Off everything that has happened so far, I think only the tailed beasts and Naruto's parents were things the writer knew when he started. Like I said earlier, the Gaara fight felt satisfying because it felt like it was built up to, and everything fit just right. I haven't felt that since, and that is a shame. Let me compare this with the anime I talked about yesterday, One Piece. One Piece set up huge plot points years in advance, in one case decades, and did so where it usually wasn't obvious that Oda was leading us there.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 11, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_44fc99681b,9
Naruto is an Amazing Anime its characters backrounds and how sophisticated it is but it is a little annoying when some fights are dragged out sometimes that's bad other times its good as it gives more understanding and suspense the worst part of Naruto is the fillers which most people agree with like 50% of the story is just fillers especially around the second half of the story is when they start but before that it is a masterpiece and the villains are especially amazing. one of the best parts is also the intros/outros some of my favorite are the 5th intro and the 1st outro wind. so if you want to have a good time watching Naruto i recommend skipping the fillers in the second half unless you want to watch them.,9,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ef86b6bf55,9
"To be honest, I used to be obsessed with this anime. Literally. I would never watch any other AMVs besides the ones that included Naruto; I thought everyone who hated Naruto were idiots; I thought Sasuke was so hot, etc... But the thing is, I only enjoyed it up until a certain number of episodes. The reason for this is, it got boring. In my opinion, anyway. I think that they should've ended the anime at a certain spot. They shouldn't have put so many filler episodes, and Kishimoto shouldn't have made Naruto: Shippuden. But, I do think the plot is great. It had a lot of potentional. The characters were a bit cliche, but still enjoyable. The art could've been better, but it wasn't horrible. I think the thing that ruined it for me, is that the story dragged on and on until finally they ended it to make a Naruto:Shippuden. Also, I was soooo into it that I guess I finally got sick of it. Overall, this anime isn't horrible, but it's far from great.

"First of all, why did most people here think that naruto was a good enough show to get at least a 7? Sorry if I am going against your opinion but I personally found this show alright. 1.) The story. At the start, naruto started off slow and I found it boring for a while until it got into it more. For that reason, I am rating the story a 6/10. 2.) Art The art style doesn't really matter to me in an anime but I will rate it anyway. Considering that naruto was first aired in 2002, it was expected that the art style wouldn't be as beautiful as some other anime's today. Knowing that I rate the art style a 6/10 3.sound The sound in the anime was good enough for me to at least enjoy it slightly. I will rate the sound 5/10 4.) Character. Now, this is the best thing about naruto, the characters. I found out that in the end, I got attached to some characters and wanted to see more. My favourite character would most likely be Kakashi for no reason whatsoever. I will rate the characters a 7/10. 5.) Enjoyment This anime was enough to make me watch all of it without sleeping my way through it. It may be slow but some scenes were enough to make me hype for the next one.

"Naruto is one of the most famous anime series of all time.(along with One Piece). Its called the number one series ever and is also said to be called a masterpiece. This is not true. Naruto is far from a masterpiece. Is it bad? No. Is is amazing? Far from it. Its just good. Storyline7/10-NO SPOILERS-Naruto is a young boy who wants to be the be the best ninja ever by training with his teacher, Kakashi, and his two friends, Sakura and Sasuke. They train toghter and try to become hokage. Naruto and his friends also learn to fight with chakra and fight bad guys. The idea starts off good, and is very enjoyable. However, there are WAY to many filler.(More then half the series is filler). Also, the pacing is very slow. It takes forever for arcs to finally finish. It is enjoyable at times, but does get old. Characters4/10-This is the worst part of Naruto. The characters arent that good. Naruto, is annoying. He never gets any better, his jokes get old. Sakura is no better. Shes very weak(she gets better, but still isnt the best). The back storys are enjoyable, but it seems like it came out of a drama anime. Gaara is the best character. Hes very strong, and has a good story. Sasuke is good, like Gaara, but the others arent.(well, neji is pretty good). The characters are bad, not terrible, just bad.(they also never mature). Soundtrack9/10-The OST is very good. I find it very enjoyable to listen to. The opening and ending themes are amazing. The battle music is epic. Naruto always had a great soundtrack. The sad music is beautiful. Art6/10-The art is fine. The character design isnt that good.(Expect for Gaara). The overall art look is decent. Ive seen better. I never think of it that much, because I never thought of it as amazing art. Just fine. Its good at some moments, however, it can be kinda poor. Enjoyment7/10-I did enjoy it. This is a very enjoyable series. The soundtrack is what I enjoyed the most. The music, is just so enjoyable. Its beautiful. This is a anime also full of comedy. The humor is also what made me enjoy it. However, ive seen much more enjoyable series. There are things I didnt enjoy like terrible pacing, and filler. The enjoyment is good, but not great. Overall7/10-Naruto was a series I enjoyed. However, its VERY overrated. Its called the best anime ever, but its not. The manga is much better. It cuts of all the fillers, better art, and better pacing. Read the manga. Dont watch the anime. It is good, but not number one.",7,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c3c87b099f,9
"I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming hokage, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters. OST and EST in this anime are perfect. Having seen all episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect,and not everybody will like it,but to me it's one of my favorite anime ever..",10,Recommended,"Oct 14, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e5b45c8d81,9
"At first, I thought it'll turn out to be a good anime since it was common. But, I was wrong. The character development isn't as great, since Naruto starts as having a dream to become Hokage and goes through several missions and at the end of the series, what did it turn out to be? Having a dream of becoming Hokage once more. Meanwhile, Sasuke's dream is to kill someone that he's been willing to kill, and at the end what does he do? Search for the person to kill him. And it really does not make sense whatsoever. Ninjas are dreadful creatures of the hidden, but I only watched this just to get more of a favor for ninjas and what do I get? More dislikes for ninjas. My ideal for ninjas was a positive manner until I watched all 220 episodes of this, praying and hoping for it to be at least positive. But I was wrong, there was no hope into continuing it to the second season. But, unlike my selfish self, I decided to. It was the worst decision in my entire life. What I believe is that this anime isn't pointed directly to teenagers. It's pointed directly to little kids that haven't had a taste in good anime or cartoons yet. Character development was poor, story was filled with filters (so much that I got lost), art was decent due to the fighting scenes being all nice and stuff, but the drama in between it... It's annoying. The sound was decent, the enjoyment was alright. Reason being is: The only thing that I was enjoying out of this was my laughter. How funny it is to see someone else being more dramatic than my surroundings in reality. Making me reminiscent. If you're one of those people who takes anime seriously, then you'd probably crash with anger by the time you hit Episode 10-22. It was a naive anime, but it isn't pointed directly towards the older audience.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 29, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_94646ba18a,9
"This is my first review. I hope I don't come off as too much of a jerk. I watched quite a bit of anime before I watched Naruto. I have had some beautiful high points while watching (FMA Brotherhood) and some disappointing lows (SAO). Sadly Naruto was one of those lows. Story: 4 Repeat after me: FILLER EPISODES! This was the worst for me. I usually binge watch anime, so sometimes watching 3+ episodes in a row where the plot made next to no progress became a little mind numbing. Not only that, but the main story line was just kind of boring. I never felt entertained by it. Most of the entertainment I got was either unintentional or just basic slapstick humor. Art: 5 I've seen better and I've seen worse. Sound:7 The sound is great. The themes set the scene well, and the Japanese voice acting is great. I don't have any experience with the dubbed version however. Character: 5 I hate Sakura and Sauske. They are crappy, underdeveloped characters that are whiny and annoying. It's a shame that they are main characters. Naruto is okay. The only characters I liked were Shikamaru and Rock Lee. To directly quote my friend Matt, ""Rock Lee is a badass. Everybody wishes they were Rock Lee."" The only reason he watched Naruto was to cheer on his boy Lee. Enjoyment: 4 Wow. When it comes down to it, I only finished the series to put it on My Animelist. There, I said it. Even Rock Lee wasn't enough to save this show. I honestly didn't enjoy it too much.

"Earlier I wrote a review on Naruto, but I deleted it because I felt I didn't go into much detail, now I will review Naruto in broader detail than before. Masashi Kishimoto is one of the many artists to be inspired by highly popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball, like the other two of the ""Big Three""; Bleach and One Piece. Dragon Ball is one of the most influental anime series ever created, a story of a boy named Son Goku who wants to be strong and be there for his friends while defeating the baddies with peserverance, courage,& a sufficent amount of training, simple yet incredibly groundbreak. So here, I'll compare Naruto to Dragon Ball. Story- Naruto follows a very similar formula of those of Dragon Ball Z(as well the same pacing), though one thing should be known, the concept isn't very original: ""A pucky, young boy who longs to become the best ninja there is by becoming the next Hokage, & doing their job better than they've ever dreamed to"". That concept has been used so many times on a Shonen, so Naruto is another coming-of-age anime,& the biggest question, does it deliever? You bet, it may not be too out-of-the-box or defining, but it does give us good settings,& nice built-up though it has many pointless flashbacks, it balances in the themes of friendship, trust, batrial, vengenase,& never giving up very well, like the way Team 7 worked together and truimphed through their missions was something to behold.....but all that takes a backseat after Sasuke disbands from the squad and the series no longer feels like the very entertaining coming-of-age series we used to know but became more like a shallow and boring sob-story. Art and Animation- Nothing to brag about here, the character designs are poorly-drawn, have poor palleting, there's so many errors(but hey, atleast Naruto looks cool),& they're very generic, but it's quite different for the manga as it looks infinitly better,& back on topic: The animation is very choppy, one moment it's fluid but in another it's cheap(compare Naruto vs. Kiba(cheap) to Lee vs. Gaara(fluid)) , it's not the same to say for Dragon Ball as it was well-animated for it's time period although some scenes in there looked cheap. The Opening and Ending sequences look fantastic though. Sound- Top-notch here, top-notch. The voice-actings fit the character's personality very well, DUB AND SUB, but one character's voice-actor I'd like to complain about and that's Sasuke's, the guys who voice him are atleast in their 30's, when Sasuke is 12-years old, Junko Takeuchi(who voices Naruto Uzumaki in the Japanese version ) might have been more fitting for his 12-year old body than Noriaki Sugiyama,& the dialogue is unnatural at times. Othere than that, I applaud the performance. As for the soundtrack, it's one of the best I've ever heard in an anime, they enhance the events,& really fit the atmosphere of the show, really worthy of importing. This is one category Naruto handles better than Dragon Ball. Characters- Well not being as likable or well-defined as Dragon Ball characters, they are still very-well developed(for the most parts), the characterization is handled much like Dragon Ball as they grow physically and mentally. Though a lot of people find them annoying, I don't mind most of them really but I don't agree they're one of the deepest and most well-characterized. One character I feel is complete waste and shouldn't be around is Sakura Haruno, she's the Krillin of Naruto but not as memorial, although she does vouch to be more helpful but she does not fullfill that prophecy untill Shippuden,& she's generally extremely annoying,& she's unbearable to look at. The characters are your typical Shonen archetypes: Naruto is the hyper-active kid yearning to be the best of the best, Sasuke is a rival of Naruto,& Sakura....she's a b!tch and doesn't do much more than lust for the rival. Enjoyable- I'm not gonna lie, I really did enjoy this series, granted it's not even close to being one of the best animes out there, I don't think it's even a candidant for it. The first 100 or so episode are amazing, it has amazing fight choreography, atlmost on par with what you've seen with DBZ, but the rest...not so much, that's where all the fun stops, I'll admit the comedy filler episodes were a breath of fresh air but still. Positives: + Decent story + Stunning Opening and Ending Sequences + Top-notch voice-acting + Top-notch music + Well-defined Characters + Easy to get into + Cool Fight Scenes Negatives: - Overall weak Art and Animation - Not original - Filler Episodes - Overabundant Flash-back scenes - Sakura Haruno Final Verdict: Without the filler episodes, it may have gotten an 8 or 9, but the series is perfect if you wanna get into anime as it's not hard to follow. And if you like Shonens(primarly action-packed ones like DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho), defintely watch it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. :)",7,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_98ce615b79,9
"Really good show that is understandable on why it is considered a iconic and great show. Looking back ""Naruto"" is really good and is hard for me to critique though you can see the flaws that are about to happen at any point aka most of ""Naruto Shippuden"" but that will be talked about a other day. The show is about Naruto who is hated because he has a Demon Fox inside of him by the village which is never shown again besides the first episode and no one really hates Naruto for it besides his personality. In the beginning if the show the characters are balanced for the most part even the protagonist feels achievable in some way toward the end. Naruto is about a kid who what to become hokage aka the president of his village but first has to become a ninja because all hokage are strong and smart people which Naruto is neither but he care about to people around him. He train to get stronger with is peers and fight bad guys and is about friendship and mostly determination!!! I liked most of the part the are all well done and can't remember any had one.

"(This review is about the original show NOT Shippuden) Look, Naruto is an old school masterpiece. It is often what people describe as a ""hood classic"" Naruto has been cemented as one of the ""big 3"" alongside One Piece and Bleach The series has some of the best written characters in all of anime. Every character is memorable. The story of Naruto is about an orphan named Naruto who wants to become the next Hokage (the leader of his village) and prove to everyone that he can accomplish great things. That's the general concept. The show has some of the best arcs in all of anime. The mist village arc? Banger. The chunin exams arc? Banger. The 4th hokage arc? Banger. The animation team was switched during the forest of death arc and nobody seem to notice. That's how good this show is. The sub and dub are both excellent but the dub is iconic and what everybody grew up watching. Naruto as a character is somebody we all grew up alongside. To watch him go from a child who struggles fighting his peers to taking on literal Gods is..just such a journey. Naruto put anime in the mainstream. It is absolutely something people need to watch or at least know about. You don't have to watch all 200 episodes. You can read the amazing manga, watch the play, or even just watch Naruto explained stuff on YouTube.

"One of the most classic shounen anime of all-time; But this review in particular will focus on the childhood adventures of Naruto Uzumaki and how he navigated his journey on becoming stronger as a ninja. It's a long ride of an anime compared to today's standard but I do recommend it as a starter anime to watch. Animation (6.5/10) - It is good for its time in the early 2000s. But its quality is really showing of its age that it was something published a long time ago. As a casual, it wouldn't be too obtrusive with the viewing experience but there are compilations online showing that in a closer look, the show at times cheaped itself out lol. But still majority of the battle scenes especially were decent so props onto it. Storyline (7.5/10) - I think its major arcs were really good and can hook you up easily. But the thing about Naruto in general is, they have dragging filler episodes. Sometimes its just by an episode, sometimes a whole bulk of it which I think was one of the things that really shaved off some points to this ranking. But still, their main story is enjoyable and really a distinguishable build-up for a greater progression in their series' future. Soundtrack (8.5/10) - Naruto has one of the catchiest and versatile music library I've ever heard on. From the OSTs, sound effects, background music and so. They are really enjoyable and memorable to listen to both inside and outside of the show's context. It ranges from Rock, Traditional Japan, a bit of Japanese Pop and so on. Couldn't complain. Overall - 7.5 out of 10",8,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9b7ac6d0ed,9
"Naruto has undoubtedly left its mark on anime history, boasting numerous iconic moments, immersive world-building, diverse characters, and a unique art style. However, it is not flawless. While the series shines with its varied cast, each with distinct abilities and personalities enriching the narrative, it also faces criticism. Some character motivations are questionable, and inconsistencies plague the series, from character designs to animation quality. Flashbacks disrupt the narrative flow, and with its 220 episodes, Naruto feels excessively long, its pacing sometimes faltering between engaging and sluggish. The inclusion of filler towards the end further dampens the momentum. Despite these drawbacks, Naruto's iconic moments have cemented its place in anime culture, making it a series worth experiencing.",7,Recommended,"Mar 12, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0bf54e2c8e,9
"Naruto is one of the most popular anime series out there. Does it deserve it's praise... well... Let's get started with some things I DISLIKED about the series. -Some episodes are dragged out WAY too long. For example, the dialogue is extended and there are so many sequences when the characters are just staring at each other without accomplishing nothing. -The music wasn't exactly the best. Yes, it is iconic and nostalgic, but a lot of the music sound like one of the fail flute memes you see on the internet that was pretty popular back then. -This is an overdone argument against Naruto but... Sakura really sucks. She is the definition of the wasted potential of a MAIN SHONEN CHARACTER Now that's out of the way, what did I LIKE about Naruto -The characters were so unique. Their abilities were so dissimilar and interesting. Every character got a chance to shine in the original series. -The emotion felt real and raw. Whenever a character went through a hardship throughout the show, you truly felt their pain. -The show had great themes and morals. -The rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke was well blended and executed. Throughout the series, the two rivals start becoming similar and power levels, and it escalates till the final canon arc in the show. -The fathership that Jiraiya has developed with Naruto is sweet. It adds extra character development for both Naruto and Jiraiya. -The power levels were just fine. It established skilled characters, and how Naruto came to overcome them without becoming ridiculous -The fights. Amazing what can I say. Fluid animation, amazing sound effects, and loads of choreography and action when they aren't being dragged out by dialogue and pointless flashbacks Now, do I recommend everyone to watch Naruto Part 1? No. This show is very long, and its successor is even longer. If you have the time and patience to see a slow story develop into something truly lovable and amazing, I would recommend a commitment to watch the series if you're interested to see what the hype is about.",8,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2d42433e52,9
"Okay, to be honest, I can't really say anything because so many people have already reviewed & watched Naruto. However, I can say a couple of things. First, Naruto has an amazing plot line. Yes, there are way too many fillers, however, the plot itself, the ninja, it's all unique to Naruto alone. Second, the characters are awesome. They make you cry and laugh and shout at them for their stupidity. They feel almost real. Third, I just want to say that honestly, a lot of people say Naruto is cliched, and it might be in our eyes, where anime is hugely popular. But when Naruto was first published, it created the cliches - the weak-strong MC ( ect Izuku Midoriya from BHNA ), the two rivals, one naturally talented, one weak ( ect Yuno and Asta from Black Clover ) and the typical cool, black-haired guy ( Ray from The Promised Neverland ).",8,Recommended,"Dec 17, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e80a2c89ec,10

"In one paragraph, here's a review from someone who watched Naruto as a newbie but is now a relatively experienced anime fan: Naruto is the first anime that I ever watched. Sure - it's not like any of the current mainstream anime (under 30 episodes). It doesn't have the intellectual intensity, dynamic story line, quick and intense character development, and other factors are common in all great anime today. It's quite long at some times, there are some annoying fillers, and its been going on for over 15 years. But, at least for me, that is what makes it great! See, spending time on this show, watching the characters actually grow as time passes, enjoying the strong moments and sobering through the sad ones is what makes this show appealing to so many young people across the world. Naruto has all the elements of an anime meant to show the beauty of life - not to delve into an intellectual or emotional rollercoaster. I might even say that some of the important decisions that I have made in life may have been inspired by this show. Undoubtedly, I will continue to watch Naruto, Boruto, or whatever comes despite how good or useless it is - think of this as a testament to what this show means to me and so many others.",10,Recommended,"Mar 9, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f042e3a232,10
"When I first starting watching Naruto I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it and thought it was going to be a bad anime, but now I am watching Naruto Shippuden. I always hear that if you watch Naruto and enjoy it your weeb trash but Naruto had a great story, great characters, and it was very enjoying to watch. When Jirayia was introduced it made me think, so is this just the stereotypical perverted anime character? at first I did think it but when Jirayia started teaching Naruto I learned he is much more of a deep character. When Sasuke got the curse mark and became more powerful it made me think ""Is Sasuke now an equal to Naruto?"" due to me not knowing of Naruto being a Jinchuriki. When Naruto first had a the nine-tails chakra leaked out it left me confused. When Gaara was introduced I thought he was going to be a main villian but he turned out to be a Jinchuriki and be converted to the good side. So if you think Naruto is weeb trash watch it and you will most likely enjoy it.",10,Recommended,"Sep 14, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_018b92b88c,10
"Ah, Naruto...... The anime that has defined the Shounen battle series for over a decade and then some. Many people love it, many people hate it. Despite all this, Naruto has gone on to be one of the most popular anime of all-time. Here are my thoughts. Naruto Director: Hayato Date Written by: Junki Takegami Creator: Masashi Kishimoto Story (10/10): Many people hate the story of Naruto saying that it's cliche, moves way too slowly, has way too much filler, and is boring, and some of these gripes can be true. So how is it a 10/10? Because of the deep and dark plot that develops over time and it allows for you to truly love the show like I did. Art (7/10); Now, Naruto was my very first anime. So, when I first watched it, I thought that it had the best art ever (10/10). However, looking back, it really doesn't. I am not saying the art sucks. In fact, I think that it was quite good for the early to mid 2000's. But you can't deny there are anime with far better art. (The art in the Manga is much much better). Sound (9/10): I love the music for Naruto. Especially Go by Flow and Haruka Kanata by ASIAN KUNG FU GENERATION. The Raising Fighting Spirit is one of my all-time favorite anime songs. It is beautiful and always got me hyped for the epic battle that was about to occur. The music can get overused at times (obviously since there are 220 episodes) but I still love it and it is fantastic. Character (10/10): Quite arguably the best part of Naruto - the characters. Naruto is a character you might hate at first but you'll grow to love him as the series goes on. He's a knucklehead, a loser, a nobody. No one is his friend and no one respects or acknowledges him. However, he strives to see the best in everyone, no matter what. Over time, almost everyone in Honokagakure (Hidden Leaf Village) respects and acknowledges him. Sasuke is a child ninja prodigy with a dark and deep vengeance against his older brother, Itachi. Sakura is a girl ninja who all she does is cheer for Sasuke and Naruto and get in the way of a fight. Many people hate Sakura because of this. However, she acknowledges her own faults later on (especially in Shippuudden). Kakashi is an excellent character as he turns this group of ""idiots"" into a great ninja team which is no small feat. Kakashi is my 2nd favorite anime/manga character of all time behind Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop). There are tons of other amazing characters as well. Enjoyment (10/10): Despite some of the awful filler, I love Naruto. Always has, always will. It was my very first anime and will always hold a special place in my heart. I will never ever forget Naruto and how much of an influence it has made on me. Overall (9/10): Overall, Naruto is a great anime despite its flaws. Naruto is great, sometimes down, but never out. I do recommend the series, especially if you love Shounen anime. However, skip the filler unless you are a die-hard Naruto fan or you absolutely feel compelled to watch all of an anime including its fillers. 9/10.",9,Recommended,"Jul 7, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b3222634b4,10
"I love Naruto. The plot is almost perfect. The animations are great. The score perfectly underlines every emotion (it almost made me cry (Wind-Akeboshi)). The character development is awesome, they all have a backstory and you really feel with someone because the emotions are brought to you so well that you can understand their feelings. Now the negative side of it. It has an awful amount of Filler-Episodes and that really is annoying. While some are quite enjoyable, most of them are just boring. Also in the middle it can get a bit boring because of these episodes. But in the end all I can say is that you should give it a try because if you know what is a Filler and what isn't, you'll be able to skip all the boring episodes. P.S.

naruto in its self was a good anime it had a solid storyline and great character development but i had to draw the line when they started getting into the filler series. this review will be put into 2 parts Story and Character Part 1: story ok well naruto starts off with a boy of the same name trying to become hokage ( you figure this out because he is saying this 500 times almost every sentence) and he does this by pulling pranks on the leaf village ( of course that will let you become there leader) after being caught he is tied up and sent to NINJA SCHOOL! of course little ninjas need to go to school to and then fails the test to become a ninja. he is convinced to steal a sacred scroll from the hokage by one of his teachers Mizuki ( who only appears in this episode as a villain) after some fights naruto uses shadow clones to beat up mizuki to the brink of friking death he then is told by iruka he past and is now a ninja. as i said before the story is solid but gets repetitive and stupid most of the time character in naruto they like to explain characters backstory through flash backs ( such as narutos and gaaras life) or sakuras friendship with ino this gives you alot to go on with a character so you know what they went through when they were children the only problem i have is ulmost every main character has been abused in some way as a child. overal this anime gets an 8 for good storyline and good character developement,8,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a93fd0b3b7,10
"Given the voracity of the backlash against the “not-so-bad” rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don’t think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance. So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn’t as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality. The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke’s blandness and Naruto’s charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level. The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed. It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn’t saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto’s Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.",10,Recommended,"Mar 1, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8dcd2b7eb5,10
"This series starts off rather well, sets the story right and develops everyone's character at a simple level and everyone's ninja powers well. As the anime progresses it becomes crucial that you like Naruto's unwavering and blindly confident character. If not his odd speeches will get annoying and like myself you will often find minor characters a lot more interesting and you wish you could see more of them, or even if they were the main character instead. One of the cons may be that there are so many characters that the inclusion of all of them is difficult. With that, developing those many characters can mess with the pacing of the anime. When some side characters get into fights, the back story of them is then included within the fight which can get annoying and for many of the characters I really don't care about which made me skip most of their back stories. The story it self has a direction but the reader doesn't really have an idea of where it's going. Both good and bad so it's hard to tell what will happen next while knowing the characters are progressing. The animation is fine until fights start, when they move at a high speeds the animation gets quite annoying with faces and bodies getting distorted. It's a hard anime to follow but for some reason I stick with it and is probably my most followed animes as well as being one I know most about. I continue to watch for my liking of the minor characters and ninja fights.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 30, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_381df60e01,10
"Please don't mind my cracky english, please don't cringe. At first I thought writing a review under such a ""huge"" fanbased anime, my review will get lost, but never the less I think Naruto does deserve my opinion. Let me talk about me first. When I was a kid and Naruto was on TV I never was excited about, no- I hated it (maybe because of the disgusting german/english version of the first opening). But as the year passed by me and my sister watched it and give it a try but I can't really remember anything (I kinda knew, what the story was about but I mainly remember shippuden). After Shippuden end and Boruto is crap, Netflix and me decided to bring Naruto back to life (yay). So let me get the facts straight: I have watched Naruto classic with all the fillers once, I just can't remember some episodes in detail. I rewatched the first episodes of Naruto in this week, so my head is kinda fresh. Art: Naruto has his individually style you can't find it elsewhere- it musn't be the perfect masterpiece anime, it can be trash! But if the trash has an individuallity in his character design, I will be pleased. Among all the animes I watched, anime with great story etc, if they look like any other anime, I get bored. So standing ovation for Naruto. Of course you need to have in mind, that Naruto is an old anime. The quality isn't HD, but you get a nostalgic feeling from it. Sound: There are some soundtracks, that are really funny but annyoing at the same time but the openings and endings are sometimes real gold. You never get tired of opening 1, although it might be trash, never you will get bored of opening 2, 3- AH who am I kiding? All the openings are wonderful, my personal favourite of all time: 5. To much feelings in the heighest climax point of Naruto. Story: I will not include those fillers. There are plenty of sites which list all the filler episodes, so don't watch them! The Story follows a main goal from the very beginning. We all know, that our beloved brat Naruto wants to become the best ninja of all time and he wants to be acknowledge by the people, who hated him the whole time. This is basically how it starts, but it is dark from the very beginning- a child abandoned from all people in the village but never he shows his tears to everyone but change it into hard work. Altough Naruto started the lonley boy cliche(but hey, he started it first). But the story will follow a second main goal, which gets more into the center while being in the climax of the show (not going into detail). What makes the show great: You will notice, that every character which there is, shape the whole plot. This is something, that not every author manage to do- to create a whole world based of his characters and their actions. I compared Game of Thrones with Naruto. Everyone was hyped by the complicated story just based by a lot of characters and I looked at them thinking they could have watched Naruto and they would like it, but they don't watch it because it is a ""cartoon"". But lets go back to my comparison: Naruto did it first. I watched some other great shounen too, eg One Piece which is also very great, but only Naruto anime has a connecting with all characters within the show without loosing the connecting. You will see that you never wonder where character xy might be right know, because they exist in your mind already. It is so deep, that you understand every single step they make, the sadnees they feel, the anger that they keep in. What was annyoing?: 1)Based on Story and Character alone would made it a 10, but regardless I have skipped the fillers or not, they exist. Fillers are always bad and always annyoing. It is better to wait for a new episode than to see some unnecassary content. 2)Flashbacks. Every time there is a emotional deep fight or conversation there are flashbacks. It is a common cliche which is cringy. Overall: Those two points are points, that ruined a great show, but I couldn't find the sectore in which I could have prove my score at the end. Story 10 Art 9 Sound 9 Characters are 10 Enjoyment? 5, I want to give less but it seems unfair because I am rewatching it, so how I am not enjoying? Overall I cant give a 10, but 8 seems maybe to good for this anime. Again, I think Naruto is a great anime which I loved the most. But it is annoying to.",8,Recommended,"Jul 2, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1ceb1d1291,10
"Naruto. An anime that probably everyone has heard of. I first began watching this as a child and grew accustomed to the bright and crazy tale of Naruto Uzumaki, but it was soon lost in my past. After picking it up again, I was stunned as to how much I could now appreciate it after reading the manga and becoming a reasonably seasoned anime viewer. I soon became re-absorbed into the world of the shinobi, with Naruto Uzumaki the number one knuckle head ninja of the leaf. The story in inclusive and beautifully told, the art is stunning and cheerful but knows when to bring in deeper colours for the more saddening areas. The character development is what I found most interesting though. As expected for a 220 episode anime, there is a lot of character development, but what made me even more interested was the fact that characters that are side-characters or have a smaller role in the tale, their background and stories are told with just as much depth as the main characters. Overall, I found Naruto not just a fun and exciting anime, but a beautiful work of art that even had me close to tears. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of ninjas, japan, serious storyline, with a lot of fun on the side.",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0ca63adf15,10
"Oh, Naruto. I want to give this series a higher rating since it is the first anime series I have ever watched and is actually the one that helped me decide I should continue watching more. However, with the sheer amount of high quality content out there, Naruto comes off overrated, even with its few redeemable qualities. Story – 5 Without discussion of how events unfold in Shippuden, Naruto shows the early stages before the time skip of when 3 ninja have to individually develop their skills and learn the values of teamwork. I must say the story starts off excellent – there’s discussion of the ninja rules, hopeless battles that are turned around by the protagonists through tact, and introductions of characters that build them up to be extremely threatening. The coolest part of the Naruto story is how ninjas are constantly tested by their ability to see through deception. That being said, the Naruto series is almost half filler (I’m not exaggerating) and beats to death the value of friendship, but in a more “telling” way than “showing” way. At the climax of the story, viewers are supposed to feel the tension of a friendship falling apart between Naruto and Sasuke. However, while the two did have fun times, they rarely shared personal moments or really exhibited their friendship towards each other. They only enjoyed each other in a misery-loves-company way because of how they both grew up alone. For me, the strong bond I was supposed to see simply wasn’t there. Art – 3 The art improves in Shippuden, but the quality of the animation and the jagged uncomfortable drawings of the characters is really off-putting. This is a combination of Kishimoto’s originally slipshod art skills (it gets better) at the beginning of the series and just poor animation. None of the characters look good proportionally, especially the women. The scenery and Konoha itself are really nothing special either, and most of the background is painfully simple in design. Background characters look like almost no effort was put into drawing them. Still, I suppose I have seen worse. Sound – 6 The music is fitting to the anime, but nothing besides the battle soundtracks are really anything special. Compare the soundtrack of Naruto to masterpiece shows like Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bepop, or Puella Magi. The opening themes are nothing special but do have some very enjoyable tunes with JRock standouts like ROCKS, Yura Yura, Haruka Kanata, and Fighting Dreamers. While fitting, the soundtrack rarely evokes the intense emotion required of the scene. This also improves in Shippuden. Character – 3 Boy, oh boy, character development is such a disaster on this show I don’t even know where to begin. The show throws a large ensemble cast at you during the Chunin exams, almost ALL of who add nothing to the story and become complete background throughout the series. The series is also the best at building up characters to seem like they are either strong or have significant plot impact only to forget about them entirely. Examples are Sakura, one of the main characters, who doesn’t exhibit a single unique skill throughout the series (and while she gets better in Shippuden skill-wise, she is given almost no screentime) and is in the story because it needs a damsel in distress. The rest of the kunoichi in the series are no better – We don’t even know Tenten’s personality, Hinata’s around for her crush on Naruto and is just a weaker version of Neji, and Ino is the same character as Sakura except with one skill that is extremely difficult to use when fighting on her own. The fifth hokage, Tsunade, is brought in as the strongest ninja in the village, but her skills are rarely showcased either – except that one time she beats up a guy who already had NO ARMS. The same goes for her teammate Jiraiya, another legendary ninja who barely gets a chance to show his stuff, his one time in battle being so drugged by Tsunade he was essentially useless. Little else is shown about the other characters’ pasts, male or female. We know that Naruto and Sasuke had it rough as orphans and the Hyugas have a complicated family structure, but we are to assume that most of the other characters live normal lives otherwise. There’s no complexity in their pasts, and very little happens to them throughout the show to shape them into better people, unless it’s a villain who miraculously got turned around by Naruto’s words about how friendship is important (if only it was that easy in real life, eh?). The one true gem of Naruto’s cast is Shikamaru, whose sheer intelligence and developed leadership after the chunin exam makes him impressive and exciting to watch. Overall, however, what One Piece accomplishes for over a hundred characters, including a boat, Naruto fails to for a dozen. Overall – 6 While Naruto is heavily flawed in most ways, looking at it as a whole is quite different. In the same way books like Twilight are page turners, Naruto keeps you on your toes and each arc is genuinely interesting even if the quality of its storytelling is bland. There is plenty of action, maybe so much action that it detracts from all other aspects of the story. Nevertheless, it’s a show about ninjas geared towards teenage boys, and in that respect, it does well. The series presents itself as an amazing gateway anime, and it certainly is still worth watching.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 25, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f615dfedb6,10
"SPOILER FREEEE!!!!!!!!!!! “Those that break the rules and regulations are scum. But those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum. If I'm going to be called scum either way, I'd rather break the rules! And if that's not being a proper shinobi, then I'll destroy that idea!” Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime. Story (7/10) The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode. Yet, there are too many fillers and for a while all they do is go on mission after mission. There doesn’t seem to be progress at times. Art (8/10) The art is about average, but depends on when you are watching it. If you were watching in 2014/2015 you would probably rate the art lower as to someone who watched it in 2004. The original run started in September 21, 1999, so to take it in consideration the art is fairly well down for it’s time compared to many other shows out there. Sound (8/10) The soundtrack is really good. Soundtrack is good and very diverse, and there are certainly a few very awesome tracks, but I like the original better than Shippuuden because it suffers from poor timing and poor track placement, and the OST overall lacks the same sense of character that united all of the tracks. Great soundtracks would be Loneliness, The Rising Fighting Spirit and Sadness and Sorrow. Now overall, if you watch dubbed, in my opinion it’s horrible, but in Japanese it’s not bad. Character (9/10) The character development is great. It takes a lot of time to get to know each character but in about 220 eps you pretty much get to know a little bit about everyone. They take 2-3 eps just to introduce a person or they add that person to the mission, so we get to know more about them. For example, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are the characters you learn the most about in the original series, but say they add Neji to the team mission. During that mission which is usually about 2-3 eps you learn a lot about him. Another example would be during the exam, Rock Lee fights Gaara and it take 5+ eps but you learn so much about them. Now, I personally don’t like all the flashbacks but I do think they are valuable to learn about a character. Enjoy (7/10) The enjoyment was average for me. Usually, I find myself skipping parts after a while because sometimes it would be boring. There would be a fight but that fight takes like 5 eps because of flashbacks, which is valuable sometimes, but not when it’s a character who will only be there for those episodes. Take Sasuke’s arc for example when everyone is chasing him, the fights were awesome back there was a flashback every fight they got into. It personally takes the enjoyment away for me at times. . Overall (8/10) Overall, Naruto has its ups and downs. The storyline is deep, with a plot that follows the manga. Naruto also has several filler arcs which lead away from the main plot. The music is great, and matches up with scenes well. The characters of Naruto, are well thought out.. they all have details about them and are interesting to watch. Animation is excellent. Fights are very detailed, you know how far away the characters are, and there are great camera angles.",8,Recommended,"Oct 14, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_38b56005e9,10

"Okay, so I was just getting into anime when I came across Naruto. I know that most people start off with animes like Naruto, One Piece, Attack on Titan, and etc and then they move on to different anime and get a general taste in what genre they prefer. What surprised me though is that this anime has always been my absolute favorite, and although I didn't grow up with Naruto like a lot of other people, for me the same feelings come across through watching the show. The world they live in is charming, but can be quite chaotic at times. Each character has their own unique design that complements who they are and their personalities. Each character is different and it is interesting to see what being a ninja means to them. I think the thing I like most about this series is that each character has their own story and preference and how characters grow throughout the series. Like, take Naruto for example, he has always wanted to become Hokage (leader of village) to be acknowledged but he realizes that to be Hokage means to gain the trust of the village. It is amazing to see how much Naruto cares about his friends' well being and how he creates new bonds with the people he meets to be honest it is inspiring to me. And yes I do realize that there is a lot of filler but if you don't care about those episodes than just skip it and once you finish all the canon episodes go back and watch the filler. Overall Naruto is a great series for anyone but I recommend it if you are new to anime or if you just love Shonen battle series",10,Recommended,"Mar 7, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1f52034466,10
"This is not a professional review, it is a rant. All I want to say is this is one of the most dragged out animes I have ever watched. 30% new content, 30% recaps & flashbacks, 40% fillers. One fight can take up to 8 episodes easily and unnecessarily. I hated how the anime plays 3-5 fights simultaneously, it just kills the hype completely. Story seems amazing (which is why I managed to watch the whole thing). Art is complete crap and the sense of positioning is buggered. One second the two fighters are 3 meters apart, the other second they are 50 meters apart. Yeah this anime came out 453 BC, but Dragonball is older and I don't think I complained as much about its art.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 4, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_fb874488fd,10
"In America, Naruto is without a doubt the most overrated, overhyped anime of my generation. Everyone has heard of Naruto. However, since I didn’t start seriously watching anime until a few years ago, I didn’t grow up on this anime like many others did. The nostalgia factor isn’t there for me, so I feel like I’m able to give a non-biased review. Needless to say, because of the endless praise I’d heard my friends and peers give the anime, my expectations were extremely high. Unfortunately, I found Naruto to be a vast disappointment. I hate to admit the only reason I pushed past episode 20 was so my opinion of the show would be more “valid” in the eyes of my youngest brother, who adores Naruto. If you’re a fan of Naruto, I’m sorry—this review won’t be a kind one. Story: 3 I didn’t care much for the story. I wouldn’t necessarily say that the story itself was bad, only that I couldn’t find myself becoming invested as it progressed. I will say, that the main selling point of the story is supposed to be that Naruto is excluded by his peers because of the fox spirit inside him, and aims to become the strongest to prove them wrong. However, by the Chunin exams, it’s perfectly clear that those who don’t like him dislike him because he’s annoying. I found it hard to blame them. Art: 7 The art of this show is probably the thing I think the highest of. I appreciated the use of color, especially the pop of Naruto’s orange jumper and the pink of Sakura’s hair. The character designs were one of the main highlights for me, especially the naturally proportioned bodies of the girls; it’s typical in a lot of shōnen anime and manga that the girl characters will have slim waists and large breasts, but here the bodies of characters looked rather realistic. Points for that, Naruto. Sound: 7 I had no issues with the voice acting (I watched this English subbed). I did find some of the music used in the show to be a little annoying, particularly a piano riff used in the background when people were fighting. Characters: 3 This is where Naruto suffers the most. The main character is perhaps the worst offender: while they were aiming for the “lovable idiot” character type, they missed the mark. While he is, indeed, an idiot, he is far from loveable—he is arrogant, annoying, obnoxious, and arguably selfish. Whenever I bring this up to fans of the show, they always tell me “He’s so much better in Shippuden” or some variation of telling me to wait for Shippuden. In what world is it feasible to wait 220 episodes from the main character of a TV show to become likeable, let alone bearable? Don’t get me wrong, he has his moments, but for 90% of the time he was an utter nuisance. The rest of the characters aren’t much better—most of them are one-dimensional and paper thin. The biggest flaws came from the female characters, whose sole characteristic the majority of the time was their interest in a male character. Enjoyment: 3 Naruto does have its moments. However, I feel it’s fair to say my enjoyment was relatively low. Since there didn’t seem to be a category fit for me to mention this, I’ll put it here: I hate toilet humor. Despise it. So, when there were scenes where Naruto was on the toilet suffering from diarrhea or accidentally farted during a fight, or characters were seen vomiting for comedic effect, I didn’t find it funny, but rather eye-rollingly annoying. I have a hard time believing this is the same show people are praising so much. This is it? I can understand the nostalgia factor that most have, but for others like my brother who watched it within the past year or so, I’m surprised. Knowing that this was the show that made him hate on the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece irritates me in a way I can’t properly express. Despite feeling a low-level anger whenever I watch it, I’ll finish this damn series… I’ll watch every last canon episode, for this and Shippuden… for the spiteful fact of strengthening my argument and being able to back up my reasoning of disliking it, so my brother can’t tell me my opinion or argument is invalid. Overall: 5 5/10 might change as I continue on. It’s over-hyped and over-rated, lower your expectations if you’re wishing to watch it. I recommend watching something else, particularly a better shōnen like One Piece, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, or Jujutsu Kaisen.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 2, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_46d10e3626,10
"The series would be alot more entertaining if it got to the point and stuck to the storyline. Too much of the series is made up of fillers that get old fast, while all the over exighted Sasuke fangirls want to know about is whatever happens to their preacious dickhead Uchiha, etc. The beginning is boring but it gets much more interesting later in the game. It also gets way better once you get past the enormous brick of fillers and into shippuden. But I'll warn anyone who hasn't seen it right now, the fandom is huge and intimidating. Don't be a noob.

"Let's face it, this is a good shonen anime. The second anime that I had watched in my life (first being Dragonball). Overall I can say, it was a fun experience until I discovered panties, moe, and Evangelion. There are flamers and there are fanboys whose list also include bleach and One Piece and such other shonen animes of the same caliber. Enough about the basics let's get into the review. Story - Not what everyone wants, but it WORKS. That's the most important part, it WORKS. It's nice and interesting, doesn't have to be as long as it is. Fillers, not so much, i like how they get into the side characters, but there are better ways to do it then just send them on a mission together. Not so much romance going on. Would've made things more interesting. good at explaining things that happened in the past as such. Can't approve of all the plot devices used. Some are too cheap and i would have preferred if the story was darker and centered around a sadistic Naruto instead of a headstrong mentally handicapped person. I give it a 7 - Not bad, did it's job for a shonen and the main plot line is still followable. Art - Not bad but I've seen a few freeze frames that made me Lol. Not much ecchi or ero shot/Special Effects, so i can't say much. It's pretty basic. 7 - little things here and there. Not phenomenal, passes. Sound - Again, very basic. fighting sounds were also basic. Music was good. Voice acting, like able. Didn't launch any voice actors into fame. 7 - nothing more to say. Character: There weren't really any characters i truly disliked in the series. Stupid trolls flaming something they don't understand, fanboys are obsessed based on their primal instincts. Both have little to no grip on what makes a character and that's what makes them the animals they are. The villains appealed more to me than the main characters. They had more darker, complicated back stories that i sympathized with and had taken a liking to. There were way too many characters than there needed to be. Either have them be an iconic background character or make them a main character. You can only have so much in the supporting role. Their pasts are very basic and I'm not going to review it on a level of a person who has seen some deep stuff and is very experienced with those sort of tropes. The people watching this should be little kids that should be educated on these sorts of story structure and understand how they work. This anime does what is needed. And the lack of character depth is probably to appeal to a younger audience as well as well as release as many games, toys, and cosplay costumes as possible. That fact however doesn't come on as strong though. I had some favorites which means this deserves nothing less than a 7, some bad some good, balances it out. If i had taken out all the characters i disliked i would've given it at least an 8. Enjoyment - Did I enjoy it? No, this differs from viewer to viewer and to me I wouldn't have the attention span to stay in my chair to watch this. Instead I'd be watching this while doing something else in the background, not even caring to read the subs. This is something I'd give to my younger siblings to get them started on anime. They would love this stuff, and it'll prepare them for better animes by setting the bar very low on the first time. Watching a masterpiece as the first anime, really takes the luster away from the animes you would have enjoyed if you hadn't watched this first. So always watch this first before you go into Code Geass. 6 - and this won't affect the overall score this is completely unrelated. This is indeed better than Bleach (a lukeworm anime that excels no direction in particular, read my review for it). Overall grade - 7 I think it's great for it to be as overrated as this is. It's basically the front gate for newcomers in to the anime universe, and being the position as it's in, i'd prefer to have it as overrated as possible. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this anime. I wish it luck in it's future stories. Let the little kids have fun, we can enjoy it from time to time in nostalgia, but I don't recommend it to anyone who wants deep story. If you don't like it, take it to a youtube video. ~LordPlagus777",7,Recommended,"Aug 14, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_de2d54425e,11

"Naruto is one of the most well known anime of all time. Many people love it, many people hate it. I love it. Yes, it may be overrated, but I give it a 10 cuz its one of my favorite animes. Ever since I started watching it, I got hooked. I am still crazy about it. It may have fillers, has flaws, and the characters can get annoying, its still a lovable series. I wil try not to include spoilers. Naruto is about a boy named Naruto Uzamaki who had no friends. He was always alone, and sad. He never understood why everyone hated him. The truth is, the Nine Tailed Fox is inside of him. 12 years ago, this creature attacked the hidden leaf village. The 4th hokage sealed the monster inside Naruto. Thats why everyone hates him. Naruto's main goal is to become hokage and make everyone see how great he is. He starts training as a genin Ninja, and joins Team 7, with the leader being Kakashi Hateo, a Jonin Ninja. Naruto's two teammates are Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haurno. Sasuke is a grumpy, nasty boy from the Uchiha Clan, and is out of revenge. Sakura Haurno is from the Haurno Clan I guess? She has a huge crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto. Naruto and his team go on mission's, train, and go in the Chunnin Exam. Naruto's quest now begans as he encounters death, lost, and betrayl. While the series may have fillers, they arent to bad. Episodes 136-220 is all filler, so episode 135 is the last canon episode. Most of the fillers do get in the way, but some are funny and enjoyable. This anime does have a good soundtrack. It has one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime. The music is amazing! The opening songs are very catchy and lovable. When it comes to fight scenes, Naruto doesnt fail with that. Most of Naruto is fight scenes. The fight between Naruto and Neji was amazing. It was exiting, and I didnt expect what happened.(Im not going to spoil that). The fight with Naruto and Sasuke was epic, and it was like 6 episodes. It was very intense. This anime really gets you hyped when it comes to pure action. This doesnt mean this anime isnt funny. You will get plenty of laughs from all the characters. Naruto may be funny with his foolishness, and his Sexy no Jutsu, but there are fillers that will make you laugh really hard. Like the filler with Naruto wanting to know what Kakashi looks like without the mask, it was so funny how they tried to do it. Its also funny when Sakura gets pissed and beats the shit out of everyone. The funnist moments are when Jiayria is being a pervert. I also love the characters. I always Gaara. He is pure badass. He has a amazing character development, design, and personality. I love his Sand Jutsu, which makes him so strong. I also really like Itachi. Besides from Gaara, Itachi is the most badass character you can find in the original series. But almost all the characters are enjoyable and memorable. A few like Ma Sakura, Shino, and Komamahru are just annoying. But the character development is still good, mostly for Naruto. One thing I dont like is how half of the series is based of Sasuke. Naruto is the star. He should be the really important one. But is Saskue that everyone worries about. Like everyone is after him, he dissapers, he leaves the leaf village. Most of the anime is all Sasuke. But I still love the anime either way. This anime isnt to sad. But there are some moments that are so sad. Like when Ikura went to save Naruto from danger. I almost cried when I saw it for the first time. When the 3rd Hokage died it was also very upsetting. I cried every time. This anime also has sad music that gets me upset. This anime can get you in the feels. I really think this anime is really good. I always enjoyed it. I have rewatched this anime a few times, and it still never gets old. I do understand why people might not like it, and thats okay. Yes, its overrated, but I still give it a 10 cuz I love it. Plz dont write that im stupid on my comments just cuz I gave it a 10 and called it overrated. It is. But im one of those lovers. If your new to anime, this is a good choice. If your a older anime fan, then I cant recommend it. Its one of my favorite animes, and I will always love it.",10,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c4a177c581,11

"ok, let's be honest, most people who are into anime have heard in some way shape or form about naruto that it's either the greatest anime ever or its garbage. well it's neither of those things so let's talk about it. naruto is about a young ninja's journey to become the leader of his village someday and we get to see that growth through part one and then into shippuden (of which i will write my review on it later) pro's of naruto 1. excellent characters - the thing about naruto compared to alot of other anime's out there who have well written characters and sometimes even very well written and also relatable. naruto has both. most of the characters in naruto have extremely unique personality's that will appeal to a wide arrange of people and some might even be able to relate to more then one character. and more often then not if your end up liking this anime you'll probably be thinking at some point ""why don't i get to this such and such character more"" it happens alot and sadly there are a couple characters i wish we would have gotten to see less of (sakura) and more of (neji,hinata, asuma). to go along with their unique personalitys they are come with their own unique skill sets making most of the characters to be special and strong in certain area's (except sakura, no i am not trying to trash this character i actually like sakura but she doesn't do much in part one despite the fact she's the main heroine). 2.solid fighting - the fighting scenes in the show do start off fairly slow but they do get much better with each episode to show how the characters fighting and skills improve. 3. excellent storytelling - there is a solid main story here that is always pretty on target to reaching a certain point and it does keep you invested throughout the show. even though there is alot of filler (AHAHAHAHA) even some of that is interesting and somewhat needed 4. soundtrack -the feels cons 1.filler -iam going to go ahead and say that i don't hate filler but naruto does WAY OVER DUE IT. some filler is needed in order to explain many of the backstorys with certain characters which is fine but more often then you'll feel as if its a complete waste of time 2.flashbacks -way to many in part one, we get it this certain thing happend we don't need to see it 5 fucking times 3.artwork -in some episodes its great others not so much 4.wasted potential of a main character -SAKURA HARUNO 5.some parts could be explained more in part one but are just kinda swept aside. overall this is a good anime, one of my favorites because i grew up with it, i reccomend everyone at least TRY it and if you don't like it you don't like it.",9,Recommended,"Sep 22, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_461329371e,11
"This is probably the worst shounen I've ever seen. Story: 3/10. Art: 2/10. Easily the worst animated shounen I've seen. Sound: 2/10. Nothing of note here. Since the series itself is like 9001 episodes long you can probably find some good openings or endings though. I do remember Ending 4 making me want to rip my ears off, it is abhorrent. Character: 2/10. Sasuke and Naruto are basically the dumbed-down version of Griffith and Guts. They have no chemistry, and their 'friendship' consists of Sasuke getting all the girls to look at him and Naruto expressing his envy every five seconds. Sakura is just a third-wheeler who gets in the way and, oh boy, is she annoying af. The only good characters are probably Rock Lee, Orochimaru and Kakashi. Rock Lee actually puts in hard work and strives to be the best; he doesn't have asspull demon powers to guide him through everything, and he's just a likable guy. Orochimaru is actually intimidating and has an ounce of intrigue to his character. And Kakashi, well, there's not much to hate about him. He has a cool design and is pretty chill. Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically what you get when a 13 year old writes a 2deep4u shounen. Edgy dudes like Gaara and Sasuke make me hate rival tropes in shounen. Enjoyment: 1/10.

"Alright first review I've ever done, so I'm going to tackle a show near and dear to my heart. Naruto For many anime fans this was the gateway anime that entered them into this culture. It was flashy, fun, and definitely appealed to a great many with it's over the top action. Looking back however, it doesn't have the gleam as it once did. Story: 6 The story has a simple premise in common with many shonen, group of kids with special powers go and defeat the bad guys and save the world or town. Then more bad guys are introduced and true motives are revealed and it starts to become a jumbled mess. In first 6 seasons of the show( minus any filler), the story was clean, simple, and engaging to an extent; come the start of the filler seasons, the story begins to needlessly complicate then come shippuden everything falls apart into a jumbled mess full of plot holes. Art: 6 The art in Naruto is vibrant (though a little flat at points) and makes good use of color palette and the various villages have pretty interesting designs. The animation though is solid at best and downright pitiful at worst .Shippuden improves on this factor. (Sometimes) Sound:9 Now this in my opinion is what made Naruto stand out among the other ""Big Three"" The opening and closing themes are almost always catchy and the background music has a distinctly Japanese feel that always complements the mood. Character: 6 Now here is definitely the most controversial aspect of Naruto. Lets start with the main Three Naruto: He's your typical loudmouth, hyperactive shonen protagonist. Though he does go from being bratty to a more typical hero, there's virtually nothing about him that stands out from other characters, except maybe his fashion sense. Sasuke: He's the token cool mysterious black-haired character who is rivals with the protagonist. He's not really interesting and his turn to darkness is seen from a mile away. He just gets worse throughout the series. There's really not much to say about his character, he exists to serve as character development and plot. ( And fangirl-bait) Sakura: She's the absolute worst of the bunch. This character mearly serves the role of being the ""girl"" on the team and having a crush on the cool kid. Even though she did well on the ninja exams, she shows absolutely zero capability in combat and sits on the sidelines waiting for one of the male leads to rescue her. She has no real character traits other than ""Tsundere"" until season 5 where she becomes aware of her own uselessness. I blame the author for her lack of character, most of his female characters are atrociously written. That being said, she does develop a personality and becomes extremely useful in Shippuden and actually becomes likable. For the other characters it's hit or miss, some bring something new to the character archtypes, though most are flat though with little depth. That being said, there is substantial character development with almost all of the characters during Shippuden and 5+ on. Plus, since this anime is so huge by the time you finish it the characters become like family to you. Enjoyment:5 Naruto's battles are extremely fun to watch the the author gets extremely creative with his ninja abilities and powers. However, with the amount of flashbacks and fillers, you won't be seeing too many exciting moments. The dialog progressively gets better with each season, so you have that to look forward to. (Gets a solid 10 for nostalgia rewatch value.) Overall: 6 Naruto is not a terrible anime, but it's certainly not a great one either. Its cliche and stereotyped, but it's enjoyable, goofily bad, and manages to bring fond memories back.

"IT IS POPULAR FOR A REASON! I just re-watched this show two months ago, so I'd thought I should review it. When I first watched it years ago, I remember gradually falling in love with it. Asides from Yu Yu Hakusho, this was the second anime that grabbed my attention. I really did not like it at first. I thought it was boring, sexy/harem- jutsu annoyed me, and Haku's gender confused me! I think what grabbed me to this show was Zabuza's final speech. That whole scene was brilliantly emotional, and I automatically became hooked. That being said, it takes a while to fall in love with this show (it starts off really good though), and then it takes another while to fall out of love with it. But do I recommend this anime? Yes, that is considering you have the time to watch, you are patient, and realize that there is another series (Part II) after this. The show does not really end. The soundtrack for this anime is amazing! In my opinion it's unique, not classical, and better than what you expect! That's all I can say about it. The art gets better as the story progresses especially the fighting sequence. Unfortunately, I cannot say this about Shippuden (Naruto: Part II). As for the characters, after you watch a lot of anime, you realize how unoriginal they are. There is nothing special about them. However, when I first watched it, I remember having a very difficult time deciding who my favorite character was going to be because I thought all of them were amazing. Now, I cannot stand most of the characters. Naruto: the main character is alright. His perseverance is very admirable. The only problem I have with him is that he is dull-witted; but even that is a gateway to bring humor into the show. I’m glad he is the hero of this series because he does bring the good emotional side of everyone. Sasuke: He is the reason why I hate characters that are so emotional. That ""cool-dark"" vibe does not appeal to me. It is over used! He is the definition of a psychotic masochistic-emotional loser! I just want to slap him. It gets worse as the episode goes on. I did even not understand how all the girls love him. Speaking of the girls, how come they are all ridiculously vacuous? Saukura: If she is the smartest out of her classmate, there is something really wrong with the people there. All she does is love Sasuke. She is mean to everyone else. Furthermore, there are moments that she does have character development, BUT right afterward she is just annoying again: A FAIL of a heroine. Haku- he is not a main character, but I remember having an argument with my family about whether he was girl or a boy. It really did start a riot in my house. It was a mind boggling moment in my life. I swear! This was before I realized that Japanese anime always has at least one male character that speaks and looks like a girl. However, it is still surprising that the English dub kept the female voice. As for the other characters such as: Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Gaara, Lee, Choji, (and so many more!)are developed really nicely. I love them! All of them have similar traits to Naruto, but they are different and beautiful Lastly, I want to speak about Shikamaru! The laziest character of ‘em all. To be honest, I had never seen a character like him before when I started watching, so he fascinated me (now I know, there are so many of them). I feel like out of all the characters, he had the best character development even though he was not a part of all the episodes. It was done perfectly as well. The laziness still lived on, but the maturity starts revealing itself. He is what you call intelligent, not Sakura Lets just say, as cliche as the characters are, their (heartbreaking) storyline makes the show. What do I hate about Naruto? It doesn't end. There are so many fillers (pointless episodes that do not relate to the storyline). A person can only watch so much! I must have been really stupid, because when I started this show, I LOVED the filler. However, it took so much out of me that I could not even watch Shippuden. If you are going to watch the show, do not watch the fillers! DO NOT WATCH IT! The only fillers that you should watch are the ones that you like. Research the episodes before you begin. I loved episode 101: Kakashi's real face. It was a question I was thinking about since the beginning of the anime, so it was interesting to know that the characters thought about it too! And the Neji's curry episode was funny as well. If you are a Hinata, Neji, Sjhikamura, Kiba, Ino, (or whoever), there are specific episodes related to them, so just watch those only, nothing more. There are more than 100 fillers I believe, soo..... don't. watch. all of them. Overall, this is only a review for Part I.. believe me, if I had to talk about the manga or Shippuden, the rage would ooze out of your computer screen. Okay, not really, but I would have more negative things to say even though I like it.",7,Recommended,"Mar 30, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3b396faef9,11

"This really isn't that great of a show, and if there was less focus on the side characters (like what happens in Shippuden) then it probably wouldn't even be tolerable to watch at all. The world-building and soundtrack carry the show on their back. Naruto is the main character, and one of the most naturally gifted/talented/OP MCs of all time, entirely while the show tries to pose him as some weak underdog. The underdog that's never lost once. There are 2 entire seasons of filler episodes after the actual Finale of the show that aren't canon (or at least any progression gained is lost afterward, and the main plot doesn't move an inch) Overall I would never recommend this show to anyone, it's definitely one of the bottom-tier shounen anime. The only reason to watch Naruto is if you've already seen it, and you have enough nostalgia for it to muscle your way through, or you want to watch it purely because of its legendary status and prevalence in media.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 6, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6863132a25,11
"Naruto was the first anime that I've watched that drew me in of which I was aware of it being an anime. Due to that, I tend to consider Naruto the first anime I've watched, despite this not being true due to the fact that I've watched a bunch of other anime before it, but rather, because due to it I've gotten interested in the medium of anime as a whole. I've never really considered Naruto to be incredibly good, but I remember REALLY enjoying it and being into it. I really enjoyed the powers of the characters and the diversity and just the plain multitude of possibility of powers that can be used, as well as for once that a cartoon is trying to present some tragic stories/backstories to their characters. It was, ironic to a lot of the traits Naruto has, is because of the fact it was a serious story. The first of its kind I've ever had experienced. But as Naruto went on and as I got older, Naruto (the franchise) became an obvious botch, where only about 50% of the content moved the story forward due to fillers. But what is Naruto at its core? Well, Naruto, at its highest points, is a story where the world presents some characters of whose motivations and capabilities are explained quite well, where you can have a character wanting to seek a high political position because they want to be accepted by all the people that have ostracized him through his entire life, or a character that is incapable of learning any sort of special power and decided to train himself physically to a ridiculous extent, just to prove that they can be as strong as everyone else, or a character that decided to become someone's tool for war, simply because said someone were the only parental figure willing to raise them. A lot of the characters have very strong motivations for what they are doing, and that makes them noteworthy and memorable, despite all their annoying/artificial personality traits, the things they've been through and their motivation for the direction they're moving towards is engaging and makes their personality mishaps pretty easy to ignore. Naruto at the core of what it tried to be is a meaningful story about people trying to get somewhere in life and how they've suffered. Which is a hard thing to execute, presenting a lot of characters, with different motivations, goals and stories. With all the shortcomings Naruto has, it is hard not to admit that its story was ambitious in the beginning, where a lot of the backstories the characters have been presented with would be enough to create an entire story arc or series just for that specific archetype. This ambition is what made it noteworthy in the beginning. Naruto tried to present a lot of stories at the same time, present a lot of ideas, without really focusing on a singular entity too much which worked both in its favor and in its detriment. What was in its favor was what I've already praised it for, the story at the highest point. And the detrimental part was the fact that it has no idea where to go and it tried to present too many characters and ideas. It kept creating powers, characters, motivations and other such things, but as the series progresses, especially in the sequel, the powers simply don't matter and the strategy behind the fights simply starts fading, because of the sheer multitude of powers, and the characters also start taking the back seat and being irrelevant, due to how many of them are currently. In this series however, the effect of this isn't really felt, but it is true that for the most part, the main characters don't and really, can't drive the story forward. This part of Naruto ends with both characters being just one step closer towards their goal, but still pretty far from it since its merely their first. That's very slow for 135 episodes of mostly non-filler. Naruto suffers from the fact that it has no idea where to go and what to do after this series. It presents interesting powers, it creates interesting fights the more limitations it has, but the more tools it creates for itself, the less unique it becomes. Naruto wants to present interesting character stories, but it really starts forgetting on the way which characters caught the interest of the fans, and fails to deliver on them and thus manages to drag on, and just present a lot of new characters who don't really drag the story forward since their motivations are now singular or shallow. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't present this at all, but I want you to be aware of this, if you are a completitionist watcher, that Naruto's sequel will downgrade and why it downgrades. So I won't drag on just like the Naruto franchise, the story of Naruto tries to present a lot of characters and their motivations and does a fairly good job at it, but in this process the main characters don't get a lot of progression towards the goal they've set up to be. The characters have interesting motivations, backstories and abilities, but their personality outside of all these things is often jarring. The main character is a rambunxious cunt who screams and rants about how much he wants to make his village great again every chance he gets and the other protagonist is an emo kid with a hate filled boner. The action in the series is mostly comprised of presenting a variety of powers and before there aren't a multitude of abilities presenting, also using them in an effective way in order to make up for your gap in your knowledge gap. The comedy in the series is pretty much ranch, with the main character transforming into a naked girl for people to laugh, I guess, or characters acting in really over the top manners such as crying or being overly violent because they were slightly critical of them. In terms of production values, Naruto has a good soundtrack but some occasionally poor animation. The soundtrack is memorable because the composer used traditional japanese instruments while combining those with the sounds of more modern instruments, like guitars and drums. This made Naruto sound unique and innovative. And while Naruto's animation can be decent, it occasionally has some random dips in quality, where characters aren't drawn with a consistent level of detail to other points in the series or just because the series doesn't know how to color balance, partly because the series is also old. To conclude, Naruto did plenty of things poorly and plenty of things that are worthy of praise. But ultimately would I recommend it? Yes and no. I think it is a good watch if you're intrigued to analyze the series and see what drew interest to it, and why it even started being successful. It has some interesting story arcs and characters because of their motivations and goals. If you're looking for something you want to watch past that, avoid Naruto because it just doesn't know where to go and it is pretty much the definition of a series dragging on. Naruto didn't know where to go and just aimed to present as much content as possible. Naruto was made to sell, not made to please. Which isn't something anybody can deny, with its high amount of fillers or its just general lack of progression for its main characters. But while Naruto was made to sell, it also sold because of some qualities that it indeed did have. It built interesting characters, it created some interesting powers. And it kept doing that, without ever realizing, that series sometimes, also need an overarching plot. Which Naruto while it may not lack, it does not focus on. And while I don't think that I will ever forget Naruto, because you never forget your first time, I don't see how a longwinded story which doesn't have a point and drags on, will keep dragging in new people.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 29, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_221eff8afd,11
"Note: Please excuse the length; but to do 220 episode anime justice, I think a long review is necessary. Naruto is a bit of a paradox in anime. It's pretty rare for a series to be as consistently bashed by experienced anime viewers. However, I doubt that there is another series that has been more commercially successful internationally and has helped grow anime viewership in the west than Naruto. Despite the hatred it receives from the astute critics and connoisseurs of anime, even the majority of today's anime elitists in the west are probably anime fans as a direct or indirect result of this show's influence whether they admit it or not. Further, it still has among the largest and most dedicated fanbases out there. In that sense, it's like the Metallica of anime; hated by the die-hard fans, but extremely commercially popular and the reason most metal fans are metal fans in the first place. Naruto is set in a universe in which Ninja possess mystical and spiritual powers. It is set primarily in Konoha, or the Hidden Leaf Village, and follows the life of Naruto, a young Leaf Shinobi who is hated by the entire village as he is the vessel for a spiritual monster who once attacked the village, as he seeks to overcome his low social position in the village and turn into an elite ninja, in fact the leader of his village. The plot also focuses on Sasuke, Naruto's best friend and rival, who comes from a prominent family in the village that was killed off by his brother, is widely perceived as the best and most popular student, who seeks revenge on his brother for murdering his clan and (minor spoiler) turns towards the dark side as he seeks his revenge. Right off the bat, you see the potential for an extremely good plot. We have a bildungsroman in Naruto about overcoming one's social position and starting point in life through free will and hard work, essentially avoiding Sartrean bad faith if you will. Sasuke is used as a foil to Naruto, starting from the opposite position yet is eaten up by hatred and need for revenge. All this set in a compelling universe drawing richly off of Japanese history and mythology with a very large cast of likeable characters. At least, that's what Naruto could have been. Unfortunately, the great potential for this show's concept is absolutely wasted with poor execution and we are beaten over the head that accomplishes almost nothing thematically or narratively in 220 episodes. Instead of the plot I laid out above, Naruto's main conflict is resolved, or perhaps more accurately dissolved, in the first couple dozen episodes as he's pretty quickly accepted by those around him. Naruto's motivation then becomes becoming stronger because...well, no reason. Instead, all we get is continuous cliche shounen dialogue from Naruto (and almost every other character, for that matter) about how he must ""work hard and become stronger"" at almost every moment where the show tries (and ultimately fails) to conjure up some meaning and emotion. Naruto’s motivations become almost exactly what was being satarized in the film Rubber: “no reason.” Rather than relating Sasuke's plot to Naruto's main struggle, Sasuke's plight (which, in many ways, is extremely superior to Naruto's) becomes a sort of side plot to Naruto's training. That said, there are certainly some moments where Naruto lives up to its potential. For example, the climax of the Konoha Crush, particularly the development of Gaara's character, was fairly well done, if dragged out far too long. And the Sasuke Chase arc, particularly the climax battle just before the filler arc, was riveting and developed each of the major characters fairly well. However, just after Sasuke's plot climaxes--the show just completely drops any semblance of plot. For almost 100 episodes, there is absolutely no development (with the possible exception of Gaara in the last serial ""Village of Artisans"") on any of the threads developed in the first half of the show, it is literally all filler. Normally, I'm quite a fan of shows with a ton of ""filler"" as it provides room for deeper character development, the introduction of minor characters who may play a role later, an opportunity to develop an aesthetic atmosphere, and a better emotional connection between viewers and characters. Examples of this done very well is the early bits of Fullmetal Alchemist, most of Samuari Champloo, and some of the middle parts of Monster. However, Naruto accomplishes almost none of this in the infamous ""filler arc."" With few exceptions, almost none of the already lackluster characters are developed further. Far too much time is spent on developing the backstories of side characters who have absolutely no connection to the main plot or, worse yet, on childish comic relief episodes that contribute absolutely nothing at all to the show, and in fact detract from it because they're not only a waste of time but mostly horribly unfunny. Speaking of lackluster characters, Naruto falls apart in this department. For a plot that tries to be a bildungsroman, Naruto himself is absolutely static, flat, one-dimensional, and is perhaps the worst character in the entire series. Almost every character is identical thematically; they have experienced some major loss of a loved one in the past that is explained far too slowly in a series of long-wound out flashbacks or far too quickly through contrived dialogue in the middle of battle (because when one is fighting, it's obvious that everyone tells their entire life story), and all their motivations and behaviors are completely traced back to this one incident. Almost every major character is a clone of Naruto in terms of motivation, just wanting to be the ""strongest"" for no apparent reason. Additionally, almost every major character is just a cliche copy of your typical Shounen stock characters. Finally, the antagonists--especially the main antagonist, Orochimaru--are simply awful; their motivations are either explained by a backstory that is identical to every other, or not explained at all. There are three main exceptions, Gaara, Sasuke, and Neji. Let me explain why, though I might have some minor, vague spoilers in my justification. Those characters are all fairly dynamic, thematically engaging, and have motivations that actually have something to do with their backstories beyond ""I just lost someone I love."" In Gaara's case, we find someone who learns human empathy and acts (or at least would act if they did a better job with Naruto) as a foil to Naruto's demon within in connection to a back story in which his concept of human empathy is destroyed by the blind hatred and loss of the person he loves the most. In Neji's case, we see someone who learns the value of free will in connection to his backstory revolving around his place in a rigid social hierarchy, with also somewhat of a foil to Naruto. And in Sasuke's case, a character who slowly turns darker and darker in his quest for revenge (although, as I mentioned, his characterization is ultimately dropped and left incomplete), though despite his prominence in the main plot is far too thematically disconnected from Naruto. Those three characters have really good depth and showcase the best of what Naruto has to offer. There’s also one minor exception: Menma, who is arguably the best character in the entire series, a character who has an entirely different type of backstory and who appears only in three episodes at the very end of the series, but I will not explain more in the interest of avoiding spoilers. Despite how poorly the characters are written, for some reason almost all of the major cast is very likable and addicting to watch. Even though the characters are poor in a literary sense, there is some reason I just can't quite explain why I can't completely dismiss Naruto's characters. There's a sense in which one has a sense of nostalgia for characters like Shikamaru, Hinata, Shino, and Rock Lee when they aren't on screen, even if they aren't the best-written characters. Maybe it's in the way their movements are animated, or the fact that they are just similar enough that they remind you of better-written characters in other animes in subtle ways without being too cliche, or maybe because they do have fairly entertaining personalities and various idiosyncrasies. However, even the poorly written characters add to the enjoyability of the series. Arguably other than the poorly executed and clunkily prolongated plot, the art is the worst feature of this anime. I do not mean necessarily the animation, though I will have more to say about this below, I am talking about the cinematography: directing style, dialogue, camera angles, and other artistic decisions that can often make or break a series. Even though the plot is so poorly executed and I've given it a lower score than the art (I consider cinematography a part of the art score even though most people think art refers primarily to animation, I think MAL should have a directing score), I would venture to say that the cinematography is the thing that primarily destroys Naruto's quality. It features all the standard tropes of mediocre Shounen anime that makes mediocre Shounens, well, mediocre: long-drawn out battles that are so slowly progressed they're tedious; unrealistic dialogue in the middle of fighting; poor, childish attempts at comedy thrown in at the worst times; repetitious jokes that became unfunny about the third time they were told (we get it, Jariaya’s a pervert, Koji is fat, and Kakashi likes romance novels); cliche camera angles like zooming in on a character’s eye randomly during an emotional moment, zooming in on the face during a thought/aside, or doing an angled pan shot over a battle scene during an unnecessary bit of dialogue; and extremely long flashbacks either to another identical tragic backstory to a trivial character or to events that literally happened two or three episodes ago. Speaking of dialogue, Naruto is almost laughably bad in this respect. If you hate your liver, take a shot every time some character's only line is the name of another character for no good reason, or every time someone says some variation of ""I'll train harder""/""I need to become stronger;"" or anytime someone screams out the name of whatever fighting move they're using, or every time there's some variation of ""I'm going to beat you""/""I'm gonna bring you down""/""There's no way you can beat me""/another similar cliche line that a dumb jock would utter during a sporting event. But the worst aspect of dialogue, which is more generally a problem in most shounen anime, is the way every single battle tactic is spoon-fed to the viewer through unrealistic dialogue thrown in the middle of a battle, the same way that every character's motivation is completely spoon-fed to the viewer--down to the point that if there's any tension in relationship to a character, five minutes are wasted on a flashback to scenes we've already seen before. I would expect a show about ninja to convey an atmosphere of mystery; but instead, you're continually patronized by contrived, spoon-fed explanations and dialogue. Despite my problems with the cinemetography and writing, the reason why I still don't think the art deserves a lower score is because the animation is not all bad. There are a couple slipshod moments early on in the series, and it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it's far from the worst animation I've seen. I'm generally not a fan of Studio Pierrot's style (see how they ruined the second season of Legend of Korra), but something about it is fitting for Naruto's atmosphere. The sound is also adequate in Naruto. The Japanese cast is mostly fairly good, though a few of them sound somewhat cliche. I'm ashamed to admit I watched most of this show in the English dub (simply because it's so long and I wanted to multitask a little while watching); though it's far from the worst dub out there, in fact I'd say the acting is fairly decent (maybe not the translations, I’ll defer to Japanese speakers on that), it's not as good as what I've seen from the sub. The soundtrack is also fairly nice; there are a few tracks, particularly the tribal sounding one and some of the more J-pop sounding ones, that are campy and cliche, but it generally enhances OST generally enhances the anime fairly well. Like most anime of this length, it could have benefited from more tracks on the OST as it gets fairly repetitive and predictable near the end. However, there are quite a few brilliant sounding tracks in this OST; particularly some of the softer variations of the main theme. With as many deep, deep flaws that I've pointed out, one would expect me to say I did not enjoy this series at all and would not recommend it. But this is not the case. Despite it's flaws aesthetically and even though I intellectually bash it as a critic, as a simple fan there's something deeply enjoyable about Naruto. I'll admit this was my first exposure to anime as a child as I watched the dub come out as it was released in the States, but there's something more to my enjoyment of this anime than childhood nostalgia. Though there are too many battles and they are far too long-drawn out, something should be said for Naruto's battle scenes in that they are effectively used as a storytelling mechanism rather than a device to accomplish as much action as possible, as happens all to often in Shounen anime (eg., Code Geass R2). Additionally, sometimes the strategy involved in the battles is fascinating, especially if Shikamaru's involved. The plot in the first half also isn't a complete loss as it is at least entertaining, if poorly executed. Even the much-bashed filler arc is still enjoyable to watch; there are quite a few standout serials that do develop the characters well, such as Hinata in the search for the Beatle, Kurenai-sensai in Yakumo's serial, and Gaara in the Village of Painters. There are also a few serials that stand out as just being plain good stories, such as the Gosunkugi, the Star Village mission, and the search for Menma's memory (which was my favorite part of the entire series). There's also something to be said, at least in some of the serials, for the atmosphere created by the episodic nature of the filler arc. Some of my favorite anime are episodic atmospheric series such as Mushishi and there's a sense in which Naruto's filler arc is similar, if vastly inferior in quality. In fact, I'm the first to defend an anime that lets plot take the back seat and focuses on character development and atmosphere, such as Mushishi, Hotarubi no Mori E, Hotaru no Haka, or Sword of the Stranger. This style is an accurate reflection of the Noh tradition in Japanese theater and a refreshing escape from the over-domination of plot in western storytelling that we've inherited from Aristotle. If Naruto had been episodic from the beginning and had executed its atmosphere better, the filler arc would've been fine and even completely enjoyable; but it was ultimately a letdown after the first half which was extremely plot-based and was ruined by poor attempts at humor. To sum up, despite all its flaws, it is easy to see why Naruto is among the most popular anime out there, especially among younger viewers and I still thoroughly enjoy it. It's an easy watch, highly entertaining, fairly easy to pick up in the middle (which makes it perfect for Cartoon Network's clientele), and the characters are very likable if bad in a literary sense. If you have the time to dedicate to it (and at 220 episodes, it is quite an investment) I'd say it's worth watching. And everybody should watch the three-episode Menma serial if nothing else, which works great as a stand alone. But definitely, don't expect anything profound or stellar out of this anime, and be prepared to be vexed by its campy dialogue and awful cinematography.

"Text written in English The history of anime is good, the plot is very good, the situations of struggle or story are good, the 'humanity' of some of the characters will disappear and others will emerge, and the end I thought it was good that we did a kind Bridge for shippuden. But there is a lot of ridiculous thing in Naruto, which are clichés, eg women, who are men (I'm not talking about Sasuke hehe), boring fillers '-', Kakashi model (ashamed to show your face), very cool guy call gai, three team in the Naruto practically had: the most badass (Sasuke, Neji, Kakashi, Orochi), was weaker than the most badass wanted to be better (Naruto, Lee, Obito, Jiraiya) and women healed wounds (Sakura, Ino, Rin, Tsunade). The animation is sometimes very zuada more in the general context it is good, the soundtrack is mythical, plus the voice acting is pretty bad. As it has many characters, some have the same personalities, plus the very different powers and objectives only has virtually Sasuke differently, the rest either becomes stronger, and the villains are not as good. The anime is pretty cool, plus the fillers are many boring, if you do not get bored and give up anime, skip the fillers.

A animação algumas vezes é muito zuada,mais no contexto geral ela é boa,a trilha sonora é mítica, mais a dublagem é muito ruim. Já que tem muitos personagens,alguns tem personalidades iguais,mais os poderes bem diferentes,e os objetivos só tem praticamente o Sasuke de diferente,o resto quer se torna mais forte,e os vilões não são tão bons.

"THIS IS THE EMBODIMENT OF A SHONEN AND ANIME!!! TOP 1 of ALL-TIME. no other anime comes close to what this series represents and has to offer. My vocabulary isn't even big enough to describe what this series means to me. This franchise will never die. As a kid I absolutely loved it and I still do. Having something grow with you is an amazing feeling. I graduate from college next monday and I can't thank naruto enough for all the lessons this series has taught me. I'm also gonna include part 2 and naruto next generations in here instead of trying to review all 3. In addition, naruto has very impressionable characters and a memorable cast especially the villains. Zabuza/haku are very well written man, they literally are the reason naruto created his ninja way. Not to mention the whole shinobi aren't just tools and have emotions plot point. Freaking delicious!! Naruto, sasuke, kakashi, zabuza/haku, orochimaru, itachi, nagato (by extension Pain) , obito, and madara are the most complex and grounded anime characters in this series. Kishimoto went crazy with the pen!! Also the various dialogue put into this is just fantastic. Itachi, pain, obito, and madara have speeches that transcend a 2D plane. Furthermore, THE DUB CAAAAST!!! Everyone knew what was going on man, dub just hit so hard. Can't forget the heart-warming moments. I don't care how old I get, naruto meeting kushina will always make me cry and him saying goodbye to minato. The character arcs go stupid too. Overall, naruto just a great experience to go through. With me have watched over 500 anime series', naruto still stands above them as the best. A timeless story. Naruto next generations honestly shouldn't have happened so fast. Rushing it out to make money lead to a lot of negative consequences like quality and pacing. I have to skip through it to stay interested and the only interesting parts are with naruto and sasuke. Waiting on time travel arc to drop, but in the meantime I got other anime that will get me through it.

"Before I watched Naruto, I thought it looked pretty lame. I now realize I was speaking out of ignorance more than anything. I was basing my inferences on the crappy commercials from cartoon network. MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE SUBBED VERSION. Story - Naruto possess an amazing story. I found myself getting all teary eyed a bunch of times as I watched it. Quite embarrassing. The one flaw is that they over use the flashback technique. They show memories that make you feel all sad. The first time you watch Naruto this won't bother you, but if you intend to re-watch it, it becomes extremely annoying and tiresome. I found myself skipping huge chunks of the anime the second time around. Art - One word explanation. Great. Sound - Almost all of the music is great. Some of the intro songs are bad though. Like the first OP song. &quot;I wanna rocks, rocks to the chest.&quot; What the hell does this mean? I don't know. Overall Naruto is a great show. The biggest flaw is the enormous amount of fillers. Stop watching after about episode 135 because there is no more plot development, just a whole load of crap.",9,Recommended,"Jan 16, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da8d9a09d9,11
"Naruto, Naruto, Naruto. This show gets a lot of hate and a lot of praise; rarely anything in between. I can understand both sides, if we're being honest here. This show is WAY overhyped, I will admit. Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? Almost ashamed to admit it. I think this show was the first show I actually watched the American premier and stuck with it after all these years. At first, I preferred the American version to the Japanese because I hated reading subtitles, but now I prefer the Japanese, only because some characters' voices are ""slightly"" less irritating. But both are fine. Character-wise: Wow, where to begin? The characters in this show are ridiculously dramatic: tragic pasts, bad choices because of them, familial issues, blah blah blah. But despite their bitter attitudes, the main character, Uzumaki Naruto, somehow manages to change people's points of view almost every time without fail with his famous ""speeches"". Now I, personally, have never been in a fight, but I'm not sure any super villains will just stand around and watch you make a speech while wallowing in your own self-pity. Everyone eventually becomes obsessed with Naruto and after all those years of Naruto wishing everyone would like him, he ends up not giving a flying *$&^! Wanna know why? Uchiha Sasuke. Plot-wise: Yikes, Masashi Kishimoto, what have you done to Naruto? To your fans? To yourself? I think Kishimoto has enough plot holes to use as graves for every single Naruto character ever. But do fans turn the other cheek? Always. Why? Because we're so deep into this thing, why question anything now? Just shrug it off and wait for the next eye-roller he dishes out. The worst thing about this show? You guessed it! FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON... Well, you get it. Need I say more? Yes, I'm bashing the ever-living daylight out of this show, but as I said before, I don't hate it. To be honest, I'll always hold a special place in my heart for Naruto. Yeah, yeah, corny, I know. Would I recommend it? I'd be too ashamed to. I'd tell you to run the other way immediately before you get sucked it. And still, I rate it a 7. I've been with it from the beginning and I saw it through the end.",7,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0030b9f472,11
"It has an interesting story and a good plot line. The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps), the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed. But then again, there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers. ✳️Is Naruto good for beginners?

"Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio) Ok, so if you guys don't know, Naruto is an action/martial arts/shounen anime, with a second season called Naruto Shippuden. Even though the manga was completed, the author, Masashi Kishimoto, has created a second series, or rather, a next generation, called Boruto. Though I haven't read any of that series what-so-ever, this review will be only on tt revolves around the series that revolves around Naruto. I was first introduced into anime becuase of Naruto, and I started picking up the manga at my library. I finished the manga in about a year, with every-other week trips to the library, and I pretty much enjoyed it. Later on, I started watching the anime, and the rest is history. Sometimes I'll look at some things fan-made for the series, but I dont look into it that much anymore. WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! Story: 8/10 Naruto's story is pretty straight-forward: a child with spiky blond hair was hated and disliked because he had a demon stuck inside him. But as he developed to be a better ninja, he learned more about his lost parents, the demon deep inside him, and how to control the power that he was given. And even though everyone hated him (except for his stalker- I mean fellow ninja who crushed on him, Hinata, his rival, Rock Lee, and every last one of his senseis), Naruto had faith in everyone, and loved them all like family. Even when Sasuke had changed sides, and joined the Akatsuki, Nauto still believed in him, and cared about him unlike everyone (Maybe not like Sakura but...) . I decided to give the story in this anime an 8, because this anime does have potential, it really does, it's just the series is pretty much over-hyped. When I got into the series, I had high hopes that it was good as the fans of the series had said. Sure, I tolerated through the whole thing, and I'm not saying it's a bad series, just over-hyped. There's also a lot of dragged out parts that shouldn't have, especially the fighting scenes. Fights took several episodes, even though they could've been covered in one or two. Generally, I feel as if the story is pretty good over-all, but it's not a masterpiece like most people say it is. Art: 7/10 Ok, so yes, I like some of the outfit designs given to certain characters (Ex: Kiba, Deidara, Hinata, etc.,), but others were, no offense, but really werent smart (*cough cough* Choji *chough cough*). I mean, when you give a character a bage to wear on their head like a pair of fricken panties, and you thought that was a good idea? I'm sorry but you have problems. Also, there were many flaws and errors in the graphic designs that are unforgettable, like some of the graphics with Pain. Yes, some of the results can be funny, like pausing Lost Pause or something, but I mean sometimes you'd see flaws in the animation without pausing. I feel as if I've seen better art and animation styles in later animes that I've seen. Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack to this series is probably one of the most memorable parts to the series, especially some of the more sadder things, like Gaara's backstory. Though some of the fight themes could've deserved better themes, and the tribal-voice song thing wasn't as good either, but I'm deciding to give the soundtrack an 8, because most of it I enjoyed, and openings werent that bad either. Characters: 7/10 The characters in Naruto have good and bad to them. I love how each character has a dream that is related to their backstory, and how some characters can relate to another in some way (Ex: Gaara and Naruto have been hated for the demons they posses inside them). But what I really don't like is Naruto's stupidity. And the fact that they stereotype women as if they can't do anything. Like seriously, first off, Naruto's stupidity isn't that silly, goofy-cute stupidity, like Nichijou is, it's just really annoying and immature stupidity, like after a while i was just like ""Okay Naruto, thats enough. Just fucking stop."" Another thing: Girls are stereotyped as useless in this anime. Sure, I really dislike Sakura, but every time she or any other female character tries to make a difference in the show, the spotlight and glory is shined on Naruto and his male buddies. I mean, come on! If you don't want the women to do anything in the show then don't put them there! For example, there was like one guy in Magica Madoka, and he didn't really make a difference in the show, so the creators didn't use him that much. And that makes sense. But please, if you're going to create a bunch of ""Main Characters"" that arent going to do anything at all besides waste space, then dont add them at all. So, in conclusion, because even though we have some problems that include stereotyping and personality traits in some protaginists, I decided to give this section of my review an 7/10. Enjoyment/General: 6/10 Seeing this was the very first anime I had ever watched, I thought that it was pretty good. But, for some reason, when I go back to it, I feel as if the series was a bit overhyped, and after I finished Naruto, there were other animes that I just enjoyed a lot more than Naruto. Yes, it was a good anime to start out with three years ago for me, but as I had more internet advantages, I had the chance to branch out my variety in anime and manga, and I found a ton of better animes. And for some reason I seem to enjoy the less likely animes rather than the ones that everyone talks about. So in general, I'd give Naruto a 6, a 5 at the least. It wasn't one of my personal favorites, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of crappy animes to move it up the list.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 20, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_42ff1ef000,11
"The synopsis describes the show well. My take: Naruto is a very good anime to watch with one condition. Find a list of filler episodes and consequently skip them when watching the series. Thank me later. Otherwise, prepare to explore a ninja world far-removed from the typical black-clad ninja the west has come to know. This story follows the exploits of the show's namesake, Naruto, and his simple but atypical approach to life as a ninja. Along the way you will be introduced to a memorable and quirky cast of characters, such as fellow ninja student and Naruto's love interest, Sakura, his cold-blooded rival Sasuke, and their enigmatically awesome teacher Kakeshi. The animation for the show is decent, the story is intriguing, and the music is very memorable. 8/10.",8,Recommended,"Aug 12, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9326ea7d2c,12
"Minor Spoilers here read at own risk Just a heads up I skipped all but one episode of filler for Naruto. So my opinions are just of the canon. The story of Naruto is actually quite hard to explain. It follows 5 canon story arcs. The Prologue arc, The Chunin Exam Arc, The Konoha Crush Arc, The Tsunade Arc and the Sasuke Retrieval arc. Each arc has its own complex story that tends to build off of the previous arc. It's done very well actually, to the point where I didn't realize that the Konoha Crush arc happened. I had thought for the longest time that it the Konoha Crush arc was a part of the Chunin Exam arc. Some could see this as a problem, the show failing to show the start of a new arc. I think I was just being stupid lol. Each story arc has its own ups and down. I could be here all day talking about them. In my opinion the Chunin Exam arc and the Sasuke Retrieval Arc are definitely the best. One thing I wanna highlight is Naruto's great character development and how the anime shows you his character development. All of the main arc antagonist act as foils to Naruto. In the beginning of the anime, Naruto is selfish. One of the two main arc ""villains"" is the exact opposite of Naruto at this point. Haku's dream to help Zabuza achieve his dream. Every single action Haku does, he does for his friend. In the Chunin Exam arc, Naruto believes that anyone can become strong if they try hard enough. He believes in his strength and the strength of his friends. Two characters that Naruto believes in are Hinata and Rock Lee. The main arc antagonist, Neji, believes that people, like Naruto and his friends are born failures and will always be failures. The Knoha Crush arc, Gaara fights for only himself, Naruto fights to protect his friends. You get the idea. Each arc villain is used to show how much Naruto has grown as a ninja and as a person. He learns to care about his friends over anything else, which is a huge difference from when he started. I will be the first to admit, Naruot's main three characters are very annoying at times. You have the bratty Naruto, the edgey Sasuke and the useless Sakura. To make up for having three somewhat unlikable main characters, you have a butt load of side characters. Kiba, Shino, Hinata, Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Neji, Rock Lee, TenTen, and much much more. So there is bound to be one character you will end up liking. For me it was Shikamaru, Gaara, and my favorite Naruto character, Rock Lee. But despite having a large cast of side characters, the female characters almost as a whole are boring and useless. Its really sad, Sakura and Ino are just carbon copies of each other, except Ino is a little more mean. TenTen does nothing at all in the canon episodes. I think she has one fight and then is only seen again to explain minor things to the audience. Hinata is a really interesting character, but is under used. Temari is a really fun character that gets some cool fights, but is also under used. The coolest female character doesn't appear till the fourth main story arc. It's saddening to see no real effort put into the female side characters. The Op's For Naruto are pretty good for the most part. They are really fun at times and help to show the theme of some of the story arcs. Though Op 6, 7, 8, 9 are during filler so they don't have that much to work with sadly. That leads to op 7 and 8 being pretty disappointing for the most part. Despite taking place during filler, Op 9 has become a fan favorite. Due to it's impressive use of silhouette fight scenes in the op. Personal favorites of mine are Op 3 and 5. Op 3 because it shows a clear theme of moving on with your past and getting trough loneliness. And Op 5 because it is just a really fun op that does foreshadow a few important events that take place in the story. The art for Naruto is average and inconstant at times. The art style will just randomly change between some important episodes. It tends to change right before an important fight. It's annoying to have it suddenly change for a few episodes, then goes right back to the normal art style. The biggest problem for this show comes is the Mary Sue elements they throw in there. Mary Sue is a term for a character that is perfect in every way and solves everything problem with some stupid new ability that he//she just suddenly obtains. The best example of this is Neo from the Matrix. None of Naruto's characters are perfect, they all have clear flaws that are easily noticeable. But it's that second part of a Mary Sue that Naruto falls victim to. Sasuke Uchiha is almost a complete Mary Sue. If it wasn't for him being a complete jerk to everyone, he would be 100% Mary Sue. Everyone loves Sasuke. They all think he is awesome and show loves to remind you that fact over and over again. Despite his awful attitude and the fact that he literally cares about no one, he is loved and cherished by all. Almost all the girls at one point think about how cute Sasuke is. He is the equivalent of Kirito from SAO. Except you are forced to deal with Sasuke for over 100 episodes. The biggest problem with Sasuke is his special ability, Sharingan. The Sharingan allows Sasuke to predict his opponents moves and copy them. It's really cool at first, till you realize how stupid it is. The Sharingan also has a hypnotic ability that is stupid powerful. At this point Sasuke's Sharingan is in the weaker stages, but it still lets him when many fights he should easily lose. At one point they make you think Sasuke won't win every single fight with Sharingan, and while he does lose a few fights, the Sharangin allows him to win many fights he should lose. The Sharingan also randomly powers up when it needs to. When Sasuke can't see his opponents movements, boom, Sharingan upgrades. If it wasn't for Sharingan, Sasuke would be easier to deal with. Naruto himself also falls victim to the random bursts of power that Mary Sues have. But with Naruto it is much easier to deal with because his power up, being the Chakra of the nine-tailed beast, only powers him up when needed. He isn't constantly using the nine-tailed beast chakra, he only uses a little bit of it in his fights. Some fights he doesn't use it at all. And unlike Sasuke who is just naturally good with Sharingan, it takes Naruot a lot of time to learn the basics of controlling the beasts chakra. And even with this massive power boast he still loses some fights with it. It doesn't feel overpowered because Naruto isn't using it constantly, he only uses its full power against incredibly powerful opponents. Now to talk about my favorite thing in Naruto, the fights. Naruto's fights feel so impressive because of justu. Justu is basically the equivalent to ki attacks in DBZ. There is limitless possibilities with justu. Each character has a special move or move type. Naruto has shadow clone justu, Sasuke has Chodori, Shikamaru has shadow possession justu, etc. Their move pool is limited to only 1 or 2 justus (unless you are Sasuke, he has 4 justu) so seeing them have to think of special strategy to win their fights. Shikamaru's fights, in particular, are very impressive. The show establishes the fact that he is a genies and use it fully. He comes up with incredible strategies to win his fights, yet he always stays true to his lazy nature. It's actually funny, cause Naruto's fights are actually pretty boring. Until the fourth story arc, the only real combat move he knows is shadow clone justu. So most of his fights just become a punching match. And as much as I hate Sasuke, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy his fights a lot. But, the most impressive fighter has to be Rock Lee. He can't use justu of any kind. So instead he uses taijustu, which is hand to hand combat. He is at a massive disadvantage in every single fight, yet he still does an amazing job. Even if he doesn't win every fight, he always wears his opponent down. There are so many good things about Naruto, the fights, the decent plot, Naruto's character development, the side characters. But the flaws in the show are big, a lack of strong female characters and Sasuke's whole entire character. Just Sasuke's presence ruins multiple scenes. Characters like Sasuke are bland characters with so much wasted potential. When the show tries to get you to care and feel bad about Sasuke it fails. Because we know who Sasuke is, it doesn't matter how sad his past is when we can't relate to him in the present. We can't like him in the present because he isn't a good person at all. He was only a good person as a child, if the show started with that and then we saw the transformation of him becoming a jerk in the beginning of the series, then maybe we could care about him. But, he starts the show off as a jerk and ends the show off as an even bigger jerk than he was before. Despite my problems with Sasuke and the female characters, I would sill recommend Naruto to anyone. It is a good show, with many great qualities. The show struggles in regard to girls and Sasuke, but besides that, I found myself enjoying almost every single moment of Naruto.

"Naruto is easily in first place in my top 10 worst/i hate animes of all times, i have never seen a anime this overrated before, the only other being gurren lagann, this series started more than an decade and there are still those fools who think it's an epic story, and unfortunately raised what is now one of the worst fanbases of all animes alongside one piece and dragon ball, it didn't make part of my childhood lucky for me because for a lot of people it did, and unfortunately i don't even like talking about anime with those it did because i can see they don't much about anime to begin with There are many reasons why this is the anime series i hate the most, this is an list of someone who tried more than once to like this godforsaken story, but unfortunately in the end it served of nothing, the only redeemable valor is the soundtrack and a few fights, and that's it, and that cannot hold an series. That aside let's start this rather long list 1.Main characters, the characters in naruto are the very definition of cliche, especially Sasuke, the guy is screams cliche every time a word come out of his mouth, characters in naruto are really badly developed, aside naruto and and maybe shikamaru, gaara, hinata and itachi, all others are mostly throw in the thrash can without a decent development or even a decent fight, also, my god sakura and ino motivation, is that what they want? date an prick who treats everyone like shit and think is dark and badass?'''oh i want to kill my brother'' that's arguably one of the worst motivations in an anime, and people say Sakura and Ino are good characters, not even in hell they are, they were always terrible, no wonder as the series went on hinata started to become more and more popular, because the girl always had an objective despite liking naruto, these two became so notorious even the most die hard fans of naruto often hate especially sakura who is useless, people are tired of this princess stereotype of female characters that can't do jack shit and that's why often you see people who prefer the villains over the main characters(this includes myself). 2.Villains, the villains on the counterpart, are actually more interesting than the main characters, especially Zabuza, Haku, Orochimaru, Kimimaro, Itachi, Kisame, Kakuzu and hidan(the best duo)etc however they are just like a lot of the main characters thrown in the thrash, they have great potential but are poorly used and are defeated by some of the most outrageous plot armor in an anime ever, especially Kimimaro, which had big potential, this same feat will repeat in shippuden with characters like, sasori, deidara, kakuzu and hidan(my two favorites), the entire akatsuki, they could have been the main characters not the villains easily since they are leagues more interesting than the main characters, hell imagine how cool would it be if konan was the main ''heroine'' instead of generic and boring character that sakura is? 3. World/Lore, the world in naruto was never well explored or well used, there are other villages but in the end is all about konoha, clichemoto tries to make the series have an deeper world and lore and etc, but he fails every time because he doesn't know what to do with it, the characters only mention other places and villages, but its never shown, and to tell the truth the other villages from what is commented are a lot more interesting, but mostly pointless, the only interesting thing on its lore is the bijuu like kurama/kyuubi and shukaku and a few others that appear on shippuden, and that's it, it doesn't explore beyond that, and even that he finds and way to screw it up by making bijuus except kyuubi useless for the most part except awaking the 10 tails. 4.Bad logics and plot armor, ever since naruto started, it was clear clichemoto doesn't know how to make character power levels, because it makes no fucking sense, and kid who trained idk for like only months be able to beat and war veteran and born to battle enemies who knows a lot more about fighting and still loses, this is ridiculous, this is an example of bad logic and use of plot armor, and this happens from starts to finish and it manages to become worse in naruto shippuden where the restrictions are thrown in the garbage and everyone starts to become chakra gods. 5.The animation, well the naruto animation always had an bad legacy, it has a lot of flaws and just plain errors that can be noticed if you pause while watching, some even say not to pause naruto while watching if you want to avoid it, the worst part, is because there are other animes from pierrot like bleach, and bleach has nowhere near the same problem naruto had, which makes you question why the fuck it's animations are bad for the most part and feel cheap, there are other animes from that same decade that don't look as cheap as naruto, and don't think the manga is way better because clichemoto is not that good in drawing, occasionally rising above average but not that much 6.Soundtrack, the soundtrack in the series is perhaps one of the few solid points of it, it has soundtracks that unfortunately marked an generation, but aren't necessarily good nor bad, it only served more to please the naruto fanboys so they can keep living in their forever nostalgia, sure there good soundtracks, but i would say there are better ones out there, hell bleach has an even better soundtrack, shiro sagisou did an better job in bleach compared to naruto soundtrack, also the openings, well the only one i consider good is the last opening, which is not an j-rock opening we have seen a million times, it also demonstrates martial arts better than the anime, and unfortunately almost all of the other openings are j-rocks that are nostalgia driven, and aren't really that good, also fuck you asian kung fu generation for making one of the most overrated openings in the planet that relies on nostalgia, also known as haruka kanata 7. Fillers, naruto is already notorious along with bleach and even one piece for it's fillers, it's one of the reasons a lot of people(like me) hate the series, the fillers really made the quantity of episodes bigger than it should, naruto shippuden ended with 500 episodes thanks to it's god forsaken fillers, and classic naruto is no different, the series were stretched out thanks to them, and that's not a good thing, plainly made for greedy reasons to keep the money flowing and also give time for clichemoto to create more cliche chapters. 8. Story, the story in naruto can be noticed to be very scripted and filled with some of the most boring cliches ever, this is why when the fourth ninja war happened and it went downhill and consequently screwed naruto reputation(for me a good thing, finally people woke the fuck up that it has never been this amazing story to begin with), because the story revolves on the same classic idea of good x evil, sometimes trying to blur the lines of good and evil along with a bit of philosophy, but it doesn't hold up it's cliches nor it saves, it just makes you crave when something new happens, only to be filled with cliches again and again as if they were new and ''good'', and people use naruto story as an compare meter to other animes, which is pathetic, this story has never been that good to begin with, starts slow and weak, gains a bit of strength, goes downhill, it's not like bleach and one piece, were bleach starts really strong, one of the best shounens starts ever and then loses a bit of steam but manages to get back, or one piece where it starts really weak but then BOOM especially in the alabasta and marine ford arc, also this is another problem, there is no marine ford arc level on naruto, which just shows how clichemoto doesn't know what to do sometimes This is perhaps naruto biggest flaw, some of you will agree others might just some insane logic to try justify it, but it's still an flaw, and it never got better in the series, especially in the fillers, and it's one of the reasons i hate naruto because it shits on this pre-idealized idea for some generic designs and the final and biggest flaw is.. 9.The characters don't fucking LOOK LIKE NINJAS TO BEGIN WITH, This is pretty much an flaw of naruto that breaks immersion and makes you see the characters as anything else like monks, mages etc anything but ninjas, clichemoto character designs for the most part sucks, and it shits on the idea of ninjas, you know stealth oriented warriors that are completely in black, and are deadly and kill without hesitation, which is something 90% of the characters lack, the only two characters in this entire fucking series that look like an ninja and act like an ninja or close to it, is Kakuzu and Haku, BOTH WERE SO BADLY USED AND DEFEATED BY PLOT ARMOR THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS, WHY THE ONLY FUCKING 2 CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE NINJA IN THE SERIES, WERE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE, WHILE CHARACTERS LIKE NARUTO HIMSELF,KIBA, INO, SAKURA, SASUKE, CHOUJI, TENTEN, ROCK LEE, KANKURU, TEMARI,KONOHAMARU AND HIS FRIENDS, SHIKAMARU, GAARA ETC DON'T LOOK LIKE NINJAS ARE STILL IN THE SERIES, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO STUPID THEORY OR JACK SHIT WILL JUSTIFY THIS, NARUTO IS THE WORST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPEN TO CONCEPT OF NINJAS AND IT ALSO MANAGED TO DETURPATE IT, WHY THE FUCK PEOPLE TURN AN BLIND EYE TO IT? ''oh but is clichemoto interpretation of ninjas'' NO ONE ASKED FOR HIS INTERPRETATION OF NINJAS, THE GUY NEVER HAD AN CLUE OF WHAT AN NINJA LOOKS LIKE FROM IT'S HINTED ON HIS CHARACTERS DESIGNS AND HE SUCKS, IF YOU COMPARE TO D-GRAY MAN CHARACTER DESIGNS, NARUTO IS ANEMIC ON THAT ASPECT. And perhaps this is it, all the reasons why this series sucks and is overrated, it's an series that has finally fucking finished,(at least until boruto shows up ZzZzZz) being stretched up to 500 episodes thanks to its fillers, and perhaps something better will come to take it's place, from which i deeply hope, this series is an testament of how people let their nostalgia a lot of time speak bigger and ignore flaws, flaws from which made naruto lose a lot of popularity especially in the future fourth ninja war, like i said i tried more than once to like it, but i's like banging my head against the wall for something not worthwhile, i hope clichemoto(yes i call him this way after my friend called him that) at least learn something from all of his mistakes, and please god stay away from any other ethnic group and don't try to deturpate it, this review is huge but i wanted to stay clear all the reasons, not just some empty hater who just hates it because it's popular, no i hate it because it was never that great to begin with, only have popularity, thank you and have a nice day watching better animes.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 3, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e45a18edf8,12
"This is my first review, so please forgive me if I make grammar mistakes as English isn't my first language Naruto is a show that many have grew up with, many people love this anime and I have lots of friends who told me Naruto was the first anime they've watched, even Naruto was the first anime I've watched. But enough of bias opinions, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should watch this show. Story: The story is simple to follow and isn't difficult to understand, although some points in the story it's starts to downgrade and begins to become a bit sloppy, the show is 220 episodes long and does it ever feel to slow down? Yes it does sometimes, I wasn't completely upset by this as I still enjoyed the story till it's finish line. Overall: 7 Art: The animation unfortunately isn't very consistent, it sometimes dips in quality and can look really bad sometimes, other times it can look great where it's concentrated at best, some of the fight scenes in this show can be done good or bad. thankfully the majority of them are good(in my opinion at least) Overall: 6 Sound: The music in this show really is one of the best aspects about this show, the most notable one is probably the sad tones which stand out the most, especially in emotional scenes. Even when the battles start the music gets you pumped up and excited. Overall: 8 Character: There is a large cast of characters in this show, there are some good and some bad characters, Naruto can be found annoying sometimes and it's easy to see why, the character designs are unique and it's an underrated aspect of the show, each character looks and sounds different, with different morals and goals which makes the characters so beloved in the Naruto series. Overall: 7 Enjoyment: You can enjoy the series a lot, watching Naruto getting better and learning from his mistakes gives you a feeling of happiness, unfortunately the show has a lot of fillers which are one of the biggest drawbacks of this show, fortunately you can easily skip these episodes by searching online filler and non-filler episodes of Naruto and you can end up enjoying the series a lot. Overall: 8 So should you watch this show? Yes, It's a show with many flaws but can still enjoy it on certain level, just don't have high expectations or you will be severely disappointed.",7,Recommended,"Jul 1, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1075c86724,12
"Introduction *Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read me blabbering on and on and want to go to the story review part.* Naruto is a great anime that I have watched so far, I started off with Naruto Shippuden at first because I didn't know about the original Naruto. I then, held on to Naruto Shippuden at about episode 200 when I found out about Naruto. After I started the first few episodes, I was very hooked and it seemed really cool seeing Naruto when he was young and knowing the back stories of Naruto. I finished watching all the episodes in about 1-2 weeks, due to the fact that I was on Summer Break and had the whole day free to do as I please. Story 9/10 In the beginning of the anime, the first few episodes was great. They gave me tears when I was watching them because it was both joyful and sad. Later on, the story began to get me very hooked due to all the action, friendship, and training in it. It taught me many lessons and got me thinking. The fighting and action in it was enjoyable and didn't last too long or too short like many other action anime. What made me give a 9/10 instead of a 10 full was because: First, I didn't like the too many fillers that didn't relate to the story and was very boring. Second, the fighting was repetitive, Lastly, I didn't like the flash backs that Naruto had *SPOILER* about Sakura, Sasuke, and him. *END OF SPOILER* (Or if you want to avoid the boring parts, skip to the Overall Review) Art and Sound 10/10 First of all, the art was great considering when the anime was made. The art included lots of detail and the colouring was great. Next, the sound for the dub that I was watching was very good. I didn't notice any mistakes in it at all. I might have lots of Spoilers here during the Character Review so if you don't want any spoilers, skip to Enjoyment Review Character 7/10 The characters were okay but *SPOILER* I didn't really like how Naruto's personality was being all goofy and weak. I personally didn't like how Sakura treated Naruto very poorly, and Sasuke like he was the hero of everything. I also didn't like how all Naruto's classmates including his friends, Sakura and Sasuke treated Naruto and bullied him. But I guess the bullying made Naruto stronger and not weak anymore. The last thing I didn't like was how Sasuke showed off all the time and called Naruto a loser. *END OF SPOILER* Now, moving on to what I did like. *SPOILER* I liked how Naruto's character developed from a weak crying boy, into a strong, never giving up kid. I also really liked the scene when Naruto fought Kabuto to save Tsunade and him not giving up even though he had little chance of beating Kabuto. *END OF SPOILER* Enjoyment 10/10 Even though there were some minor things that I didn't like, I really did enjoy this anime. It is one of the few best anime I've watched. This anime is really enjoyable and if you haven't watched it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW! Overall 9/10 This anime is just great with some minor mistakes/annoyance in it. As I said in the Enjoyment Review, if you haven't watched this anime, GO WATCH IT NOW!!",9,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b168af7ef5,12
"Naruto is a mediocre anime but the main reason why everyone remembers it better than it actually was is because nostalgia. I'm sure plenty of old Naruto watchers used to do that stupid run and stuff like that makes people remember it more. The story is aight and same goes for the art. The soundtrack is alright as some of the sound effects are memorable,I can't say the same about it's OP and ending besides Fighting Dreamers. The characters are the usual shonen protagonist. Bullied kid,Cocky Bastard,Useless girl,A sensei to teach him shit. Naruto is the embodiment of the classic Anime protagonist. Even though it's a mediocre show,I enjoy it purely based on nostalgia. If you're in your early teens,you'll probably like this but if you're in your latter teens/adults,you're gonna cringe a ton. You probably shouldn't watch this.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 28, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_52f2781bd9,12
"To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

"i was a big fan of this manga & show when i was in elementary school but as the time i grow up i kinda find the story too monotonous but it doesn't mean it's boring. Story [9/10] acually the plot and the universe is masterpiece, pretty interesting and well made, but as i grow up reading this manga, it's kinda like lacking something... i wonder what it is.. Art [10/10] but i have no objection with the art & animation is superb, the action and all is the best! if i would compare to any other anime that have combat action scene i think naruto is one of the top list!

SOMEHOW.. i found naruto filler episode is the best! even i kinda skipped one piece filler episode, but there are interesting filler episode of naruto that become my fav! because it has a lot of character, the filler makes it great how its create more story about the side character and how the relationship between each other!

"Naruto was one of my first anime's (other than Pokémon) and I loved it I started watching it in 4th grade when I was only about 10 years old I'm not one of the og's that watched it on cartoon network I watched it on Netflix but I still loved it in story I give it a 10 the reason I give the story a 10 is because it was amazing and I was not bored for a single whole arc (not counting filler) for art I give an 8 since it was made in 2002-2007 it doesn't have the greatest animation but its not that horrible there are some fights that have really smooth animation for sound i give an 8 for characters I give a 7 characters are the only weakness of Naruto as a whole a lot of the characters they just throw away maybe make them do a couple cool things but then they just use them as side characters for example Rock Lee, Shino etc. but a lot of the characters are still good and I really really enjoyed this series I would rewatch it if i had to except the filler so overall I give this series a 9",9,Recommended,"Apr 23, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_37bb295bab,12
"Alright, let's get into this. I have watched Naruto as a comfort anime since I began it when I was 7. This review is coming from someone who really likes Naruto to this day, 9 years later. But I will be as honest as possible. If you are just now watching Naruto I'm sure there aren't as many good reviews, for it's time Naruto was definitely cool and interesting in concept and execution. Also you're pretty late to the party but that's alright :). The concept is very cool, a story about ninjas, fights, bad guys, and the characters finding themselves? Heck yeah, sign me up. The story is done well, one of the big complaints I saw was the amount of fight scenes. This wasn't really an issue for me as I like action packed anime. Another complaint I saw was fillers. And since I started this anime so young, I didn't know what fillers were so they never bothered me. But I re-watch Naruto almost every summer, and honestly they still don't bother me. I always treat filler episodes as a kind of break, for me and the characters. Plus most of the filler episodes were pretty fun, aside from some of the less interesting ones. But if you can't stand fillers I really can't recommend with full confidence no matter how much I love Naruto. That isn't to say that fillers are the whole anime or that they ruin it, but there are a lot and some people would rather not and that's understandable. CHARACTERS!! This is where my personal favorite part comes in, but it also comes with some of my biggest complaints. The overall character development is very cool, especially if you continue to Shippuden. The main character, Naruto grows into a very likable person right in front of you. Sakura is one of the most complained about, as she is seen as useless and annoying girl who just needs help constantly. But personally she was one of my favorites, because her constantly feeling useless and even being called it by the other characters made her want to be better. And lead to great character development over time. Sasuke is the edgy mf that younger fans of the anime always end up fangirling over. Not that it's a problem just kind of silly :). He is the mysterious guy, has his own selfish goals and cares not for the rest of the main characters. (seen above). He's also strong from a pretty young age, and smart too with gifts of his own. But he still needed a lot of work to get better and that makes him not so unpleasantly overpowered. He shows a lot of changing of which I can't mention because of spoiler reasons. But he still has a growth throughout the anime, even if it is in a strange kind of way. Now my biggest complaints about characters, is that some of them are very interesting and cool in their own ways that are nothing like the main characters. A lot of my favorite characters didn't get a whole lot of screen time and felt VERY slightly neglected. I say slightly because eventually, if I'm not mixing in Shippuden here, most every character gets some kind of screen time with their squad. Which made me very happy to see them have their own little arc. But they do tend to do typical side character things, but they are still pretty well rounded overall. Fight scenes are an interesting thing to review on Naruto. While being a lover of fight scenes and not really caring how long they go on for, I would get very invested and the time just passed. Some would last several episodes and could have been done in fewer, but it just added a little something I can't explain. But yes there are long fights. The fighting animations are really fairly done. I'm not an animator so I feel uncomfortable dissecting it harshly. I felt that it was overall smooth and eye catching. Very proud of the studio. Overall 8/10 :)",8,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_14683ff89e,12
"Okay Okay Okay. Naruto is a great series to watch... If you have no job and have a few spare hours to fill. It has enough to be mildly entertaining. I have a few annoyances with this series though. Characters: Usually naruto and sakura; They both tend to do things in the middle of a fight that make you want to cringe at. Sakura just sits in fear, hardly has a decent fight scene. Is really boring to watch. HELL!! It annoys me when she constantly bags Naruto for being useless and you feel like screaming ""WELL WHY DONT YOU GET OFF YOUR ASS THEN SAKURA!!"" Naruto: I enjoy humour, but this kids a little brat. He just complains and gets in the way all the time. Its like that annoying smelly 5yro cousin the constantly gets his face in the way when you are ready a book. Or who sits and asks a million questions when you are playing video games... annoying is an understatement. Also, when it comes to the fight scenes. I get extremely annoyed at sequences where the main hero powers up to his highest levels AND STILL GETS THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF THEM! You get all excited, only to be very disappointed. I might add Dragonball Z has this problem time and time again. Plus the fight plots arent very creative. it starts off easy, then the enemy has hidden potential. someone comes in and saves the day.... BEARLY!! There arent any moments when you are proud of the characters triumphs. By the time it ends you are left thinking ""well its about time!"" Also, I dislike the lack of variety in the fighting. They seem to forever repeat the same attack again and again. No new moves. No combos. Nothing that makes the next boss fight amazing! Coming back to things characters do that are just flatout stupid. You think ""that was obvious!! how did you not notice! you are a freaking ninja!!!"" Im not saying they need to be godly powerful, but its not clever stuff that gets them. ALSO IM SICK OF THE REPLACEMENT JUTSU! the one where they trap the guy and they turn out to be a log or something. WAY WAY OVER USED!!! I might just add, that Gurren Lagaan has none of this and is still amazing. The fighting is impressive and gets.to.the.point. when they power up, you know its gunna get brutal! and it does! Even when Rock Lee uses his 'Forbidden' jutsu, its amazing!!! But it doesnt even amount to the finishing move. He still loses and it kinda feels like it was pointless to even try. I like my Movies, anime etc to get to the point and stay on track. Like Dragon Ball; naruto is fine to watch with a spare moment. But its so repetative in ideas, it feels like ""same shit different story"" THE END",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 5, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_29ade9dd3e,12
"Review 6: Naruto (Favourite hero of all time)??? now if you haven't ever seen or watched naruto, then ur crazy..... and if you haven't even heard of Naruto....then where the hell have you been all of your life!!!! Nearly every anime fan as watched or has been reading naruto and if you haven't and you love manga or anime then you truely do not deserve the title Super Fans or Fanettes!!!!!!! if you haven't heard of Naruto then i do sort of feel sorry for you in a way, since nearly everyone has at least been reading or has read the naruto series. i don't want to ruin it for nearly everyone who actually reads this review but it is an amazing series that everyone should check out, it doesn't matter if you read the series or watch the series it really is worth your time and will stay with you for the rest of your life. obviously naruto is the main character through out the series, he lives in a small village with plenty of other ninjas that are his age and there are plenty more kids you'll meet on the way to discovering who naruto actually is and what can make him so powerfull yet so stupid at times. Naruto: obviously the main character in the series. he's a young, active and slightly weird boy who loves being a ninja even though he isn't very good at it..... He's crazy even from the beginning of the book when as soon as you go onto the first page he's dangling from a rope painting on the hokage (s) stautes faces, he does get caught and then you can see how weird he actually is. Most of the teachers get extremely annoyed with him no matter what he does, he annoys a lot of people in his classes and is jealous of the strongest and most good looking boy there is named Susuke. He hates him and never gets a long with him, apart from that Naruto can be an annoying boy in the series but as time passes you grow to love him even more! he can be really strong and quick witted at times, like when ever he's in a fight. you'll grow to love him as time passes on. Sasuke: A mysterious young boy who's about the same age as Naruto, every girl in the school loves him and has an extreme crush on him, he isn't really bothered about all of the girls though he and he doesn't seem to act really cool he just is cool.....naturally!!!!! every time he walks in to the class room all of the girls stare and it falls quiet. Naruto hates his guts because he gets all of the attention off of the girls, Sasuke hates him aswell which must be natural aswell. At the start you'll love him but as the series progresses then your opinions on him may change slightly. Sakura: Sakura is a young girl about the same age as Sasuke and Naruto, the only difference inbetween Sakura and the other two is the fact that she is mature enough to understand that not everyone has to be rivals in life, she loves almost everything and has the biggest crush on Sasuke ever, but Sasuke captures all of the girls hearts so he doesn't really notice if there is one person stands out more than the others. She has a rivalry with an old freind that you'll meet later on in the series. She doesn't have a mysterious past at all, but when she was younger she did get bullied a lot for having a high forehead which made her stand out a little bit more then everyone else. she's an average character who i think everyone will love from the start. if you live in england then you might know that there is a magazine called NEO which comes out every month and if you read that then you should now how many films there are on the naruto series, how popular it is, the fact that there are loads of videogames on the series and that naruto has to be in the magazine every month to new releases and new books coming out. the series is on going and amazing even though it is long. if i was one of you guys and i was reading this i would check it out straight away it really is worth the time and you will enjoy it. i would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!! of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4th Of July 1:15 pm ~Amy Xxxx",10,Recommended,"Jun 8, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_5a7d43c2b5,12
"Naruto is exactly the epitome of what's wrong with shounen anime/manga the same way Bleach and Dragon Ball were flawed. YES I realize these three anime, however flaws they may have, are iconic and staple mainstream anime... but if you stopped to think about the story REALLY, they're not very good. Naruto starts off strong and likable as a series altogether. The show however uses a bad trope that ruins most shounen stories; escalation and one upping the previous arc with a stronger enemy. And the protagonist becoming stronger by rinse/repeating what they did previous arcs is how they show character growth? So dumb. I know most people complain about fillers but I don't even need to. Even without the fillers, this anime gets it so horribly wrong. By the end, they lost sight of what this anime was even about in the beginning. Sure he wants to be Hokage but honestly that's so vague and general in the grand scheme of things going around our character. Also how this anime holds your hands like a baby? Do we really need a flashback to the last episode 3 times in one episode? Naruto is trash; there's a lot to like about Naruto but ultimately it isn't very good. If you MUST know what happens in Naruto, just read the manga so you won't at least waste your time. This show is so cringe worthy too; like if a giant monster is attacking you and you just took a fatal blow to save someone, you're going to die or the monster will go after you. It's not going to let you sit there and allow for a crying sappy 10 minute scene. Stay far away from Naruto. Go watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's actually a good shounen and holds up well. Also, shows like FMA does NOT use the terrible ""escalation"" trope where the character's growth and journey is parallel to their growth of strength/power like some bad Dragon Ball fanfic.",4,Not Recommended,"Jul 28, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb5692bd4a,12

"Naruto is one of those animes that is really well known has a huge following. I've attempted to watch it for years but failed in a couple attempts. But thanks to netflix i have finally been able to watch the entire series. Well minus the filler i skipped those episodes. The show starts out and i hated the lead character he was loud and annoying and seemed to repeat the same lines a ridiculous amount. As the show went i would say i had passing interest until around the episode 50 mark in the series. The characters seemed to really start to develop around this point. In the chuein exam arc in particular. Naruto himself gradually became less annoying. Sakura slowly faded to the background before disapearing almost completly. I found that supporting cast was actually moe likeable then the main cast. Kikashi was two scoops of awesome but their would be long spans of time he would completly disappear from the show. this would happen with pretty much everyone except Naruto. One problem was that some fights would drag on way too long. One in particular that featured a character death took so long that the impact of this characters death was completly lost. This was something id call dbz syndrome where a character over explains their moves. Another thing that came up alot is that it seemed during every battle a character would say ""i have used up all of my chakra"" or something around those lines it got to a ridiculous point that i joked about it with a friend. I think what holds this series back is the fact that it drags things out too much. In the same way dragonball z did. The fights that are the most enjoyable are the more all out action fights. There were fights that did last multiple episodes that were fantastic like the last ""main"" fight of the series that the animators seemed to bring beyond their a game and during that series of episodes itself i would give a ten for the arc as things just looked beautiful. The story had some great moments and if some things werent dragged out like i think that if the show were cut it half we probably wouldnt lose alot. All in all i would recommend this show it may not live up to the hype some people give it but it does have its moments it is worth a viewing if you have the time i would suggest finding a filler list to skip filler episodes though.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 11, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f10db1fa70,12

"Naruto has changed my life for the better, growing up with it in my childhood it really helped me through some tough times. I absolutely adore this anime even with its glaring flaws, like, for example, the story sometimes gets mixed up and doesn't make sense a bit of the time. Even with those, it's an outstanding anime that I would rewatch thousand times over. But again, there are major flaws. They tend to make some characters bland or not even give them enough screen-time to flesh them out, characters like TenTen are really good examples of a good idea but not enough screen-time. Not to mention, Sakura, a main character, had hardly any screen-time and was the bland female companion to slow down everybody. Bringing it back up, the story sometimes gets a bit mixed up in itself which can lead to confusion or completely backing up on something to make it work. I get it, the whole series was 720 episodes you can't really predict what'll happen in the next 700 episodes, but storyboarding exists for a reason. People wonder why I like Naruto as much as I do, but I gotta say it's mainly because of just the overall appeal of it. Who doesn't like a story about ninjas who can do cool techniques featuring elemental styles? Not to mention there are some techniques that are a mixture of elements for specific people or clans, it's really just an overall great concept. Not to mention I really enjoy some of the characters, one of my personal favorites is Neji because he was a really fleshed-out character with motives that seemed reasonable. All in all if you wanted to, I'd advise recommending this to your friends or even watch it yourself. It's a good watch and it'll definitely fill up a lot of time and boredom.",10,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_798b46880a,12
"I haven't read the manga. Yes, I watched the dub. This review is episode 1 to episode 135. SPOILERS! Naruto really isn't that amazing. It's story is overall decent with some great moments with decent characters but it doesn't matter because it's fun. The characters are fun even if they aren't that deep and their designs are great. Kakashi, Shikamaru, Guy, Lee, Temari, Jiraiya, Hiruzen, Tsunade, Neji, Hinata, Kiba, Shino are all good even if some of them don't get a lot of screen time. Standout is Shikamaru my favorite, he's a genius with a unique way a fighting, he's lazy, he has great moments, his sexism is a fun character quirk when all his fights are against girls and he just a cool guy who's actually one of the nicest. Tsunade is the perfect foul to Naruto, Naruto is an optimistic kid with a big dream while Tsunade is a bitter old lady who drinks and gambles who's lost the people important in her life. Sakura and Ino are the weak links but Sakura does improve. The main villains are great. Orochimaru, Zabuza, Haku, Gaara, Kabuto, Itachi, Kisame,The Sound Ninja 4, Kimimaro, and eventually Sasuke are all great. There are some weaker minor villains but they serve their purpose. The music is amazing and they sound effects are nice. Openings 1-5 are all great. They're not Full Metal Alchemist level but they come close. The fights are great. Their long length will turn a lot of people off but they feel like real struggles with the two fighters in combat for hours and the show really sells the illusion of multiple fights occuring simultaneously. One major problem, the show really overuses flashbacks. Most of the time they're new information and they're interesting. They have good visuals and music but there are many that look visually boring or are information we've already scene and only pad out the run time. Top 7 Fights 7. Shikamaru vs Temari 6. Neji vs Kidomaru 5. Naruto/Sasuke vs Gaara 4. Gaara vs Kimimaro 3. Rock Lee vs Gaara 2.Orochimaru vs Hiruzen 1. Naruto vs Sasuke",8,Recommended,"Oct 22, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c020035c70,13
Naruto is one of the best story lines no one will tell you otherwise. However i feel like if someone knew nothing about Naruto and just watched the first few episodes they may find it a bit too childish but i ashore you if you can battle threw the first few episodes you will find out why people of all ages love this story so much and hopefully they make it to shippuden for a even more enjoyable experience. there are some darker moments to the show that give many a new perspective on life its almost like watching a motivational video as well as a very well done story its a long story but definitely worth the watch. 8/10,8,Recommended,"Feb 24, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_520f96e5cf,13
"I love this shit, ever since 8th grade when I started this show its made me feel nostalgia no other show has ever made me feel. God damn, shippuden kinda dissapointed me but this, this shit rocks. This show deeper than anime, the life lessons actually meant something and kinda shaped my life into me wanting to be a hardworking person. The nostalgia when I think about being a kid watching this show is overwhelming. Never in my life have I cried over a show, unless i tried to i dont think I would be able to cry. But Naruto, the nostalgia, it made me so happy yet sad as I reminised over my childhood and the sheer happiness I had when I saw this show. I can understand why people think its overhyped, you need the right conditions to experience this fucking masterpiece. Make this the first anime you watch, dont watch another one for a month and let the nostalgia roll in.

"So, Naruto. The first anime I watched, back when I was 8. I rewatched it recently and deciced review it. Naruto is a Masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I know it has a lot of flaws, but the positives aspects outway massively the negatives ones. So, let's get started: The story: amazing and unique. It talks about an alternative world where most of the population are ninjas, that do missions to help their villages and can do special techniques/ attacks with hand signals and 'chakra'. The commedy was , for the most part, funny ; the mistery was enthralling. The pacing was decent, not being great because of some filler episodes. The art: honestly, is the weakest part of this anime (as well as the animation). The beginning especially, although we can forgive it because it is from 2002. It gets progressively better and better as the episodes go on. The animation is fine too. The sound: awesome! I can't say if the japanese voice actors fit the characters or if they were good (beacuse I watched in my native language, not japanese - in my language they did fit the characters and were good). The music and sound effects were amazing. Sad songs to make you feel, inspiring / 'fighting' songs to get you hyped and excited. The characters: very good too. Of course there are some steriotyped characters, but overall they were interesting, and they did a good job developing secundary characters' personalities and backstories. I thing I found fascinating while watching Naruto was that you see the evolution of the characters. They grow, deteriorate and learn with their experiences, throughout the series. Maybe part of why I love Naruto so much is beacuse it feels very nostalgic to me, but I am sure you can enjoy it even if that doesn't apply to you. I really enjoyed this anime, and it will be forever in my heart. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Feb 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7cfd726b00,13
"I'm a short and sweet kind of reviewer Overall I do believe that is so is very, very over hyped, at the same time it doesn't live up to it. what I mean is the majority of fans will like it be able to follow the story and have little to no complaints, but people who may have higher standards for animes. For me this is the first anime I ve watched all of the way through every episode. some of things I liked was the character development, the characters don't have a random spike in power, or just some bullcrap a randomly happen. its a slow steady climb and when the he there peak power is feels natural. another thing I liked was how they pulled your emotions through the story. it was kind of like real life in away. every time a character grew and though they were at the max somebody was better than them and challenged them to grow even more.. some things I hated was the overlapping of episodes. most of them were the filler episodes but there were some cannon episodes did kind of retell what happen the last one and it was the whole episode, or even the origin stories were at least 2-3 episodes long which was annoying to me. Overall this does hold a special place in my heart as the first anime I watched all the way through, and has I said at the start this is a great anime for people wanting to get into it so I suggest you what it but don't get your hopes to high P.S IM WAITIG ON A DUBBED VERSION OF 336 OF SHIPPUDEN TO COME OUT PLS I CANT DO SUB",9,Recommended,"Apr 24, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6c6d57b1c7,13

"Naruto.. I wasn't sure how to go about writing this since it's such a long series, so I figured the best way would to be write a little bit as I go and piece them together. You immediately start off with Naruto Uzumaki, he's a cheeky kid, always causing trouble and when he's not, he's eating. Though you find out pretty quickly that there's a reason for it; he just wants to be cared for. Everybody has always looked down on him and judged him for reasons he didn't know. He always just figured it was because he was different, not because of something inside of him. Finding out he has the love he's wanted from Iruka sensei, his point of view starts to change but so does everything else. From there he's placed in Team 7 with Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto has a massive crush on Sakura, Sakura loves Sasuke, and he doesn't really want anything to do with either of them. Naruto comes to have a lot of respect for Kakashi sensei, like he does with Iruka and then Jiraiya. All 3 of them play a big part in his personal development. They all show him he's loved, which is something important to him. From the beginning it's a little slow, but it gets better. New characters start coming in, whether they're here with their own stories or to embellish on unfolding the plot, it depends on the person. Some stay and become prominent, others are just in and out very quickly. In all honesty, for a lot of it it wasn't really keeping my attention well, there'd be a couple of laughs or plot points that would catch my attention, but it would drop off quickly; Until Jiraiya. He's what saved the series for me, his character type and personality, but with him came the story getting deeper and lots of questions about how multiple different things will turn out. As with really long series, it takes a pretty long time for the story to get deep, this is no different. But once it does, it's decent. A lot of it is kids growing up, that might be why I wasn't enjoying it a whole lot until more adult humour came into it. But if kiddy characters and voices annoy you, this probably will too. They're kids, they're learning, so things that are obvious to the viewers aren't quickly discovered by them, there's childish arguments and irresponsibility. But they're kids. That's the point. This is showing them growing up, becoming better and learning about themselves and others. That's one thing about the fillers, I always watch them, but people who skipped them for this missed all the growth these kids go through. Becoming stronger mentally and physically, seeing it happen is one of the best parts, and makes the fillers worth it. There are some definite feels parts, I got a little teary a couple of times. The Menma Memory Search mission arc was a big one. So be prepared for hidden emotional parts, because they pop up out of nowhere. By the end I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, no it's not something I'm extremely impressed with but I'm happy I finished it. I enjoyed it, I'm glad I gave it a chance to prove that it's better than I assumed it would be, and I can see why so many people enjoy it.",7,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2db0b136b8,13

This anime is also very unique and i would say definitely deserves the high ratings it has.

"The story started off slow enough, it doesn't help that pace gets slower once you hit the chunin exams and relief doesn't arrive till well past the introduction Tsunade. The decent fights are full of bloated dialogue What ticked me off was how overhyped people that Sasuke was. What ticked me off even more was how filler increased when pace picked back up a bit around the Sasuke retrieval arc. WHAT TICKED ME off the most was how there were so many frocking prodigies. Allow me to list: Sasuke, Kakashi, Neji, Shikamaru, Haku, Itachi, Kimimaro, Jiarya, Orochimaru, Tsunade, Gaara, All the Aukatski, Any kage, basically anyone with kekkei ginkai.

"There are so many good thins to say about Naruto and also a few bad things, but the biggest issue most people complain about, are the many filler episodes. To enjoy this great anime I recommend to skip these episodes, there are many sites that have a list of these episodes so it's easy to skip the fillers and to start enjoyimng the actual show. The story of Naruto is great, I love everything about the world the anime takes you in. The way they make you love the village and the ninjas in it, it's just amazing. The storyline has so many exciting things and unexpected twists. It didn't take me long to adjust to this show and love it. The art is good, but I've seen better. The characters look very unique but when it comes to quality it isn't outstanding. But I have to say that I have no problems with this. The fight scenes look good and almost each fight is memorable. The music in Naruto fits in every aspect. This is such an important feature in Naruto. It completes every scene in it. Almost every opening is an opening that you won't skip. The music is just great. The character diversity is another great thing about Naruto. You'll love so much characters as much as you love Naruto himself. Each and everyone has something unique and that's why you'll love them. A lot of character developement, very divers abilities, diffrent disigns. Konoha isn't the same if one of its ninjas wasn't there. This show is a must see, but I highly recommend that you skip the fillers, its much more fun that way. I don't think that anyone who has watched everything without fillers has regrets.

"Well, my first review on this website - lets see how this goes! So, I like to think of myself as a definite otaku (...sad to admit, I know). However if being obsessed over anime is what 'otaku' means then I most definitely fit the description. Naruto was the second anime I watched when I was beginning my 'japanese cartoon' journey and I'll tell you all now - if you want to get yourself dedicated to a shounen/ninja/hero/action anime with a little emotional rollarcoaster thrown in with a bucket of laughs to top it off then Naruto is definitely one to get yourself attached to. True, you might think I'm going into this with a bias opinion and I probably am however I'm going to write a review anyway. Story:- I gave the story a 9 because despite my never ending love for the anime it does contain a few plot holes which (depending on how hard you look) are noticable when you look back. For example; parents! We don't see enough of the parents buuuut nagging parents aren't something you want in an action packed anime. It might just be the hardcore fans that need the little details (I know I certainly do). And when I say little details, that's all they really are. The story arcs all eventually link together towards the end of Shippuden (which is the sequal season to Naruto) but you can tell that at the beginning of Naruto they didn't know they were going to have a second season. Art:- I gave the art an 8. Now I was a bit skeptical of my choice because the only reason I'm not marking it a nine is because of it's age. It was first released in 2002 so you can only imagine the old animating style they used to have then. You can clearly see the progression of the style as time goes on. In the main areas of animation; speaking, running, fighting etc I'd say they're top notch for the resources they had 'back in the day'. Sound:- I gave this a 10 because of the soundtrack. Naruto (and Shippuden) has some of the most beautiful and emotional music in the anime community. When I'm looking at Youtube comments I can see that people who don't want the anime are listening to this music. It's amazing. Simply put. And when put to the animation it's even more incredible. Such an experience! Real edge of your seat stuff! (I don't mean to sound cheesy). Character:- This is where Naruto gets a liiiittle flawed. I'm giving it an 8 because of the way they sometimes portray little girls. And I don't mean anything to do with hentai, Christ no, I just mean sometimes they forget how young girls are. You know it; crying. And this is where I'll leave it for 'character' because I don't want you to go into this anime clouded by the fact they portray some girls a little annoying. Enjoyment:- Well, obviously a 10! I, to this day, enjoy Naruto as much as I did when I first started it. Thoroughly enjoy every episode, including the fillers. Overall:- I gave it a 9 all together because of the two 8s and two 10s. Overall a fantastic anime which came to it's end at 220 episodes. When you get to the end, God, you don't know how to feel. You don't know if you can ever feel again. But it's worth, afterwards you get a whole season more! WhooO! I think I lost steam towards the end but I hope you find the time in your schedule to add this in. It's a great anime!",9,Recommended,"Apr 3, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e26e2f7ef2,13

"There are so many reasons to love the classic Naruto. The very first reason is the character Naruto himself. He is a young boy who is very immature. As the show progresses he begins to grow up. It is so fun to see him develop into a true shinobi. While the show focuses on Naruto he is not the only character who develops. There are many characters who you will fall in love with along the way. As far as the story goes it is quite compelling to a certain extent. What I mean by that is it tends to drag on a little bit. While on this note one downside to this anime is the number of filler episodes. It seems like once most of the show is done (around 3/4) the filler episodes go full force. The only problem with this is it has nothing to do with the main plot. So for that reason, I have lowered the overall score.",8,Recommended,"May 30, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_942a8b1f81,13

The story is one of the best i've seen, and after watching it again last year I can confirm it even more. The art may not look the best but the fight scenes are portrayed very well with the angles and sound and portray emotion very well.

You can really see their development and they get you to feel emotion for lost characters. Even the fillers in Naruto are very good and do a exceptional job at keeping you entertained.

"Naruto 1% action, 99% flashbacks I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails. Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far. Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over… It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc. You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks.

Without the fillers you still need to watch around 400 episodes but you'll never get bored even once. It's a true masterpiece. The soundtrack alone is just perfect, it fits every scene perfectly! Furthermore you get a perfect japanese dubbing, each voice is unique and acted out superbad. The story is one of the most meaningful ever created. Overall as I stated before it really is a masterpiece. Of course it has flaws but overall you'll get to see some of the best villains ever created (all of them carry a superior motivation, noone is just plain evil), the twists are really breathtaking and you get great character development as well (even the smallest siderole gets the time it deserves to fill that person with life). You won't regret it, I promise.

"I watched Naruto when I was a kid, because there was nothing else on TV. So I had to basically do with what I had. I didn't particulary enjoy it at the time either because there were more interesting shows on air like the hilarious dub for Duel Masters which is one of my all-time favorites. Naruto? Pfft, sure, the first, like 30 episodes are alright, up until the genin exam is over or whatever that shit was. And then Sasuke turns up the edge levels so high you could cut yourself if you touched the screen. The character development is an absolute joke and if you actually have some taste you'd know that someone who spouts nonsense about growing stronger and whatever the fuck else while managing to be so incredibly annoying and without any redeeming values whatsoever except the fact that they are vaguely fascinating to look at when genderbent, cannot be a good lead character. And you'd be right! Naruto is one of the, if not THE worst lead characters of all fucking time. A harem protagonist is more entertaining to watch than this bloke. It's obvious he's going to win every fight, it's obvious he's gonna train hard and get better every time. It's painfully obvious whenever someone smiles off-cam that something evil and spooky is gonna happen. Now I know the general consensus about this load of trash, it got most people into anime(unfortunately) and also unfortunate is the fact that they didn't stop after Naruto, they went after other edgy shows like Tokyo Ghoul and whatever other miraculous trainwreck and made the scores skyrocket. The fandom is garbage for this show but that's not related to it's show itself, just tangentially. You see, this show gathers all your pains and hardships from when you were an oppressed Eastern European infant with a fox in your guts and turns it into the most disgusting power trip you'll ever see, it's delusional, and suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Perhaps the delusional premise is what is most attractive when it comes to Naruto. Cause that shit just doesn't happen, ever, and if you're gonna be a smartass and tell me it's fiction, then tell the genius behind this series to make fiction credible within it's own described limits and not just plop a twist and jump the powerlevels by a googol every time he feels like it. It's strangely entertaining to watch things fly on the screen but at that point you're basically okay with just about anything ranging from flies circling your lightbulb or Michael Bay. Naruto is basically the B-Movie of anime. The budget for this is trash so the show looks as you might expect, the sound is, like, something to write home about in the sense that it's so boring you have to tell someone how boring it is. Terrible in fact, the music is trash too. Didn't have to be anything high-brow but damn they could've hired some better bands to perform instead of those garage party trash lid bangers that worked on this. If you want a power-level heavy show that really does take its time to tell you how people got those powers, in detail, bit by bit. Wasting a good two episodes or three to show you how people die. Then go for DBZ. If you just want a good shounen, a story about growing up and becoming stronger, with some real actual emotion. A Sasuke archetype that isn't completely shit. A god damn banging OP that will stay with you till your very last day. Then go with the king. YuYu Hakusho. That's my baby, that's my secret ingredient. If you feel the strange necessity to call this a good anime because you get nostalgic when you watch it, then do take in consideration the fact that you're basing it off the fact that you get nostalgic when you watch it, not because it's good. And it's true. Naruto is fucking garbage.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 26, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_efc42d934d,14
"I originally refused to watch the Naruto series all together simply because the characters appeared annoying and childish to me. I eventually tried watching it and failed the first and second time. I eventually saw the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke on youtube and this allowed me to give the series more of a chance. I rather liked it. This is one of the harder series to write a review for due to the sheer length of it. There are too many recaps throughout episodes; these take up sometimes 10-15 minutes of a 23 minute episode which is rather annoying. Filler episodes are also littered throughout the series which can be beneficial or annoying depending on how many and how bad/good each episode is. The last 40 episodes consist of about 20 filler episodes which was horrible. The length also gives it several benefits character development is one of the most notable (Maybe not for Sakura…). Character growth and evolvement is visible in many of the main and supporting characters especially Naruto and Sasuke. The animations throughout the series are solid and there are several instance of using unique art styles to help enhance fight sense and humor. The voice acting is well done but, the dialogue can be very cheesy at time, making one possibly slam their face into a wall. Naruto is an exciting series that has a solid and creative storyline complimented with excellent character development. Regardless of any shortcomings previously mentioned Naruto is a solid series and worth watching. It also has some of the best fight scenes in anime.",8,Recommended,"Jun 11, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ebcdde18e5,14
"As you can see I had to give this anime 7's all across mainly because the last 70 episodes were dreadful and drag this anime down a whole lot. With that said the first 130 episodes or so were fantastic I Must say. Naruto was one of the first animes I cracked open, and at first it appeared fresh and bold taking Anime to a new level, and it did for the most part. Although Naruto has MANY good points, it also fails miserable at many things. Story The Story has been kind of done before, a loser kid wanting to become a winner. But this loser kid has been given some kind of special power which the leader of his ninja clan implanted in him at birth known as the Nine Tail fox. Naruto now looks to become the leader of his Ninja clan, so Naruto Uzamaki with this orange jump suit and heart wrenching battle cry &quot;IM GONA BE HOKAGE&quot; sets out to become the best ninja in his clan. Characters This is where I really enjoyed the show and didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show. Of course Naruto the main protagonist is interesting for a while but the anime focuses far to much on him and puts everyone else in a very long waiting line. No other characters besides Naruto and to some extent Sauske (Narutos rival and best friend)get a fair level of development. Now the villains are certainly exciting in Naruto and for most fans like myself, the villains actually carry the show more then Naruto. Its always interesting when the villains are conspiring mysterious schemes. Overall Although Naruto is entertaining at first, it quickly begins to fade as a show that&rsquo;s lived for too long. After a while the story line becomes weak and very boring as fans ache to see more of the villain instead are fed filler episodes. The characters may get annoying but to Naruto&rsquo;s credit, the fighting style and drama is very real and new. If your looking for that anime that has a good level of action, drama, and comedy you should try Naruto.",7,Recommended,"Sep 11, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_69cfbb2661,14
"be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&quo;ve heard it was much better&help; I really hope so!",10,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e936a953c7,14
"MINOR SPOILER!!! Naruto is one of the greatest pieces of fiction in existence not even anime and it's not a debate. While it's not The Best Piece of Fiction or anime, It is by far the most influential and iconic shonen anime after Dragon Ball. It is an anime that defined the culture of Shonen anime. Naruto is one of the most Over Hated Anime of all time due to it's immense popularity. There are alot of Haters of this show and one thing I've noticed is that most of them are One Piece fans, I love One Piece but I would never hate on this Master Piece and I prefer it Naruto over One Piece after catching up. To put it, OG Naruto was a whole vibe of a show at in my opinion it had no Bad Arc and had only one bad episode(canon episode) and that was Sakura vs Ino(LOL). Review of the canon arcs: 1. Land of Waves Arc: 9.1/10 This Arc is one of if not the best first arc in all of anime and I'm not biased at all. The Land of Wave's Arc sets up this beautiful show really well and it has some very iconic moments which I will not get into if you are one of the people who haven't watched it 2. Chunin Exams: 9.2/10 Chunin Exams was another brilliant arc, Tournament Arcs always go hard and it's not hard to screw them up. The Chunin Exams were an emotion with all the things that happened in it. I can't go into much detail because I don't want to give spoilers to new fans of anime but this arc is pretty relatable with every character struggling in the Traditional Test cuz it always felt like that 3. Konoha Crash: 9.1/10 Konoha Crash follow's after the Chunin Exam's arc cuz Orochimaru(A Gay snake man) pops up and decides to vampire bite children(pedo). It follows are main guys trynna stop this gay pedo from killing everything and it is just one hell of a ride. It has some iconic moments that are unforgettable and adds on the this beautiful piece of fiction 4. Search for Tsunade: 8.4/10 The Search for Tsunade certainly wasn't a top tier arc but it had some really hype moments during the conclusion of it. This is the arc where Naruto master's the Rasengan and show's us that Talent isn't everything and with Hard Work, even the impossible is possible 5. Sasuke Recovery Mission: 10/10 The Arc that Turned Boys into Men. This arc was one hell of an Arc. The gist is, Sasuke has gone rogue and decided to go with the snake pedo in order to achieve power to beat a certain somebody which is not Naruto that we met during the Tsunade arc. This Arc was a master piece and the Naruto and Sasuke fight at the end was just a feast for the eye's, it still remains in my top 5 favorite fights in all of Anime. This Arc is better than most New Gen Shonen Anime coming out like Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen S1 and even MHA and a million time's better than all of Boruto Negatives: I've only Boasted alot about this anime but I should talk about the few flaw's in this anime 1. Naruto is quite annoying, now I love my boy Naruto, but he can be pretty annoying 2. Sakura, that's it, the entire character of Sakura is boring and infuriating 3. It doesn't give it's side character's development, it only developed Naruto and Sasuke throughout the anime 4. Too much Filler but it can be skipped but it is kinda sad that alot of it is filler 5. The Pacing can be slow sometimes but most times, it really good and not boring Rating: 9.1+9.2+9.1+8.4+10=45.8 = 45.8/No of arcs = 45.8/5 = 9.16 Final Score: 9.16/10",9,Recommended,"Jul 20, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_59a4b9a4dc,14
"The story centers on Naruto Uzumaki, a young knucklehead ninja who lives in the hidden leaf village of Konoha. He is often shunned and ignored by most people because years ago a fox demon called Nine Tails tried to destroy the village but was sealed inside Naruto as an infant. Wanting to prove himself as a force for good, Naruto makes it his goal to become Hokage, the leader of the village. Once Naruto graduates from the ninja academy, he joins Team 7 headed by elite shinobi (ninja) Kakashi Hatake. Naruto is also joined by Sasuke Uchiha, who wants to avenge his clan by killing his brother, and Sakura Haruno. Together they go on numerous missions honing their jutsu, as Naruto and Sasuke compete and fight alongside each other. The world they live in is populated with colorful characters, as well as villains who want to throw the other nations out of balance for their ends. Particularly the dangerous shinobi Orochimaru, who shows interest in Sasuke for his natural gifts. He offers Sasuke the power he needs to kill his older brother, which results in Naruto and his friends doing everything they can to stop Sasuke from going down a dark path. Whenever people think of shonen anime, this is usually the type of show that comes to mind. In that, it focuses on the hero’s journey about an underdog with latent powers he didn’t know he had, and trains to hone his abilities as he fights stronger opponents along the way. If you liked “Dragon Ball” but wished it had ninjas, then this is up your alley. It’s obvious that creator Masashi Kishimoto was heavily influenced by “Dragon Ball.” You can tell since both series share similar character archetypes, as well as humor. Some of the visual cues are obvious as well with Naruto loosely resembling Super Saiyan Goku’s appearance, and Sasuke resembling Vegeta. Both characters even share a similar frenemy rivalry that plays a major role throughout the series. Even though its inspirations are obvious, “Naruto” was more grounded in its concept because it was able to tackle meaningful morals and themes that make for deep storytelling. Naruto being an outcast is already something people can identify with. There’s also the fact that he starts out as the least talented ninja of his class. While these are tropes we’ve seen done numerous times, you still want to see what they do with this character. Not only in how he matures, but also in how he literally learns to master his inner demon. I also like how Naruto and Sasuke have similar backgrounds of having lost their families and are trying to accomplish their individual goals. With Naruto wanting to prove his worth, and Sasuke’s desire to avenge his family. Even though Sasuke is more respected by his peers because of his bloodline, he willingly distances himself from most people because of his tragic past. You see where both characters are coming from and understand why they make the choices they make. While you like seeing them interact with one another, you also want to see them go all out and see who comes out on top, which is what you would expect from a classic anime rivalry. With that said, there are a few characters I wish were given more purpose. For example, Sakura’s character was not very interesting. Most of the other characters have multiple traits and arcs surrounding them, but for some reason, she’s mainly relegated to the love interest archetype. While they do have her do some action, and even give her an arc where she proves she’s useful, I feel like a lot more could have been done with this character. Eventually, they give her a major role near the end of the series, but I feel it could have been done a lot sooner.",9,Recommended,"Feb 17, 2022",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4d0072be7c,14
"I watched Naruto fully over the course of several months, as i was very turned off by some of the filler that was painfully boring, not to say that all the filler was boring, because some of the filler is actually entertaining when done right. The Story of Naruto was very entertaining up until the Naruto/Sasuke fight, which afterwards is basically filler until the final episode. My favorite arcs from the story were the Chunins Exams, (yes, i know its a tournament arc, but still) the Zabuza arc, and any arcs with Jiraiya. The story grinds to a halt after the fight in the final valley and that is where the series turns into filler and it suffers as a result. The Art is obviously not the best, as many have probably paused the show and seen some very questionable still frames of characters. The style of the show is still very recognizable which i feel sets it apart. The Sound for the show is some of the best of heard. From the Fight music to the ""Sad Naruto Music"" the show excels in conveying the emotion of what is happening. The Characters are great with the Main cast of Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzamaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno (not really her though.). The side characters also are very well adapted, as shown with the Sasuke Recovery Mission arc. The only character that really gets on my nerves is obviously Sakura. I know hating on Sakura is a tired out subject, but it is very true, everything she did in the series was basically whine about Sasuke or hit Naruto, while one of her character defining moments was cutting her hair. I enjoyed Naruto a lot, despite its very apparent flaws and would recommend this to anyone wanting a long series to binge.",8,Recommended,"Jun 17, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_289ccc3303,14

Now as I and many other will agree naruto is absolute horrible compared to shipuden its perfect. It's one of those cliche ridden stories thats just a blast to watch. The fights are great and fluid. The art is amazing. The story is generic underdog and its perfectly enjoyable and a blast to watch in every way shape and form. Naruto is a loud obnoxious brat, sasuke is an edgy teen, and sakura is literally the most useless person ever. But its hard not to enjoy because its so well done.

"— Canon arcs were solid, except for the unnecessary recycled flashback spams at times which really annoyed me, if I'm being honest. Sasuke Retrieval Arc could easily have been a solid 10 had it not been for the Naruto vs. Sasuke on rooftop flashbacks for like a million times. However, the progression was great & it always leaves you at a state where you'd be asking for more & more. Enjoyably intriguing, to say the least! — Filler arcs, on the contrary, were inconsistent throughout with no evident tonal difference, which was a great aspect. Some were great, some were good, some were mediocre & some were flat-out boring. However, the filler arcs explored the characters, provided them some sort of growth & surfed the world pretty well! But whether the events & developments remain intact remains to be seen. I'd be happily surprised if some of the filler arcs are addressed in the future! That said, the one-shot fillers were mostly hilariously great! Wish if they did those much more than what they did otherwise. — All the characters were great. However, the vast developments were mostly dedicated towards Sasuke & Naruto. Sakura, for example, barely had any major significance or impact. Hinata too barely appeared in the canon arcs, with all the ""crush"" & stuffs there was to show. On the other hand, many characters particularly required no such development & were really likeable! Naruto's charm made him the best character of the show pretty easily. Although, Kakashi, Jiraiya, Tsunade, Lee, Guy, Gaara & Shikamaru were few of the others I liked too! Character designs were also as lovely — Naruto, Iino, Sakura, Sasuke, Itachi, Kakashi, Tsunade, Jiraiya, Kiba, Neji, Shikamaru, Choji, Shino & Anko's designs specifically were my favourites! — Comedy was spot-on. Even though some of them were repetitive at times (Jiraiya sneaking in on women, Lee drunk, etc), they always felt hilarious! My favourite gag was Kakashi's excuses for getting late though! — World-building felt solid & really interesting at times, but nothing was particularly explored to the extent where it could be judged thoroughly. The fillers could've done a better job, under the supervision of the Mangaka, at this one instead of just throwing off random locations. — Action was brilliant for most of the part, from choreography, to shot composition & animation! Especially in the canon arcs. The power system however wasn't mind-blowing or something but was simplistic & that's where its strength was! Although what held back the action's full potential was the storytelling structuring, in my opinion. For example, One Piece usually sorts out a huge chunk of flashbacks before the real fight begins. But for Naruto, it's the opposite. The start-stop-start-stop action is something I didn't exactly like, as it all comes down to preference after all. — Off-the-fights animation, on the contrary, was inconsistent throughout just as the art. Sometimes, the characters looked too round or sharp, with the backgrounds being good or mediocre. Animation too felt stiff where the characters looked so unlike. But whenever Studio Pierrot animated an episode themselves, it was always fabulous! — Background music was great throughout. Nothing extraordinary, nowhere near bad. The perfect balance you can ask for. Although, a bit old school understandably. But honestly speaking, it gets kind of repetitive & boring at times as the series progresses. — Opening & ending themes mostly were boring to me. Fighting Dreamers, however, was an iconic banger undoubtedly! Three or four OP & ED were also good enough. — I watched the full series in English dub & I must say, it was fantastic! From cast to the voice acting, everything was top-notch. The only English voice I wasn't fond of was of Orochimaru. Overall, 9.5/10 for the dub! — Movies were so very unlike the series. All of them were bad or just ""barely watchable."" However, most of the OVA's were great! Especially the Sports Day one! — But despite having not read the manga, I can confidently say the direction was mostly spot-on for the canon arcs but the fillers spread basically ruined its potential of greatness. 89 episodes of nothing significant was a pure waste of the potential though, primarily because of the storyboarding & spread. The pacing also could've much better had they addressed the issues I mentioned earlier. — Would've a 10/10 without the flaws I mentioned. Still a solid 9/10 for the canon contents, 6/10 for the filler arcs & ovverall a good 7/10 for the entire series. But in the end, the series was still enjoyable, if not ""very,"" regardless & that's what matters the most I believe! — The first & last episodes of the series were really memorable! That said, I am onto the Naruto Shippuden now! I don't exactly have huge hopes for the series, but I do expect some obvious improvements after everything Naruto Part 1 has done to set it up perfectly. Consistent enjoyment is what I'll be asking for primarily, nothing else really.",7,Recommended,"Sep 13, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_79d597a5af,14

"I know I'm probably gonna get hate for saying this, but Naruto is really mediocre to me. The story gets stale after a while, and the animation quality is poor. The biggest negatives of Naruto is its animation, and its story. The art style of the manga really didn't translate well into animation at all, and the plot gets boring. Some of the episodes are just the characters talking for 23 minutes, and that's it. People don't just want to see characters talk and not move at all for 23 WHOLE minutes. They want to see something else, like battles. The battles in Naruto are lame. I'd probably like them more if the animation was a lot better, but its not. There's too many battles, to the point where we can't breathe. And the worst part is, THEY'RE ALL MEDIOCRE. While you might think that I completly despise Naruto, I do still think it has some positive qualities. The music in Naruto is really catchy, and the characters are also very interesting. Heck, if the story wasn't so plain and stale, I'd probably really care about all the characters just like I do with Hunter x Hunter. To sum this review up, Naruto is a boring anime. It does have its few good qualities, but they're mostly overshadowed by the negative ones. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 2, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_aa3254e242,14

You are tasked to write down a set of questions related to motion, then have a random classmate answer your questions, while you answer their questions. Ok so, you get a girl's questions to answer. You read one of her questions. The first question starts off with ""Naruto runs 10km..."" and you think to yourself... ""Wait a minute, Naruto? As in the orange dude from the anime? That Naruto? Hold on... girls like anime?!?!!"" Yes indeed! It was at that exact moment that I realised girls watch anime. In that moment I thought to myself, what if I watch Naruto and try to impress this girl with my Naruto knowledge. Maybe I could gain a new friend. I know, I know. Typical cringe 14 year old logic. Later that day, I went home watched and Naruto. Man... to describe me as addicted would be a HUGE understatement! I was completely hooked! That day I officially became a weeb! Why didn't I watch this sooner I thought. Since it was a weekend I had so much time to get up to speed with the basic Naruto lore. Then here comes Monday... it was finally time.

We got a physics question that was about projectile motion. Projectile motion just means motion for a thrown object that is moving through midair. Anyway, I see this as the perfect opportunity that I was looking for. The girl then asks me (btw quick flex, but she sits next to me 😎) she asks me something about one of the questions where you need to calculate the speed of a fast moving projectile and that's when I strike her with my Naruto KNOWLEDGE! This was it. This was my moment. I say, ""dang that's a fast moving projectile, if only I had the sharingan then I would be able to see it moving"" and I smirk waiting for a response... She asks, ""the what?"" I reply with, ""you know, the sharingan... from Naruto"" That's when she tells me that she doesn't even watch Naruto and only needed a random name for the questions she wrote the other day and Naruto was the first name that popped into her head. Ayo. What? So yeah. That's basically the cringe tale of how I became a weeb. I did it all for a girl, who didn't even like anime. At least the anime was good.

I really did enjoy Naruto for the character development, you can really see Naruto gets more mature as it progresses (Not talking about Shippuden). Its also really fascinating to see all the new Jutsu that Naruto starts learning and he also learns to walk on water. But also like every anime he has a goal, to become Hokage. The anime is really amusing and it can get really intense and some points, not a lot of emotional parts though which is a shame. Now the bad part about the review. Naruto gets super repetitive. The story starts off like ""i want to become the hokage"" and they start doing missions which dont help in becoming Hokage at all. Also Naruto gets really off track when something happens to Sasuke. The other thing is the english dub voice acting, it sounds like Naruto smokes like 10 packs of cigs a day In conclusion, i don't hate Naruto. I sincerely don't.

"Es una serie de aventuras ninja con muchos combates y una historia algo comun, al menos eso parece al princio con todo el rollo de los torneos y eso. Sin embargo goza de una gran cantidad de personajes perfectamente definidos, cada uno con un encanto especial y que interaccionan muy bien. La historia es sumamente dinamica y entretenida, pueden disfrutarse varios episodios seguidos sin problema, es mas, el problema sera dejar de ver la serie jeje. En mi opinion, es una de las pocas series que de verdad logra integrar una gran cantidad de personajes sin que se sienta forzada o manipulada la historia, cada personaje tiene su lugar y momento de importancia. Hay escenas dramaticas, de mucha accion y algunas que hasta hacen llorar. Una de las mejores series, yo no diria que la mejor, pero si de las infantables en toda coleccion anime. Para usuarios nuevos es recomendable ver al menos 3 o 4 episodios para agarrarle el gusto e ir comprendiendo la trama, que en apariencia no es complicada, pero si que engancha con el tiempo. Tiene un cierto parecido a yuyu hakusho o dragon ball, al final de cuentas es un shonen de batallas, pero a diferencia de estas, como ya dije, goza de mucha variedad de personajes que interactuan perfecto, seguro encontraras a tu favorito muy pronto. Recomiendo verla, es una de esas series imperdibles.",9,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_203f6cff04,14
"Yo fine people of myanimelist.net, I'm about to set this whole Naruto debacle to rest so sit tight, get a blanket and get damn comfy cause this is coming rough and raw. Let me start by saying you need to get rid of your f**ks all of them until there's nothing left but a child like sense of wonder and a hunger for adventure with a thirst for escaping reality , put them f**ks in a basket or a storage cabinet somewhere where you can use them for an anime that is thought provoking because that isn't Naruto. What Naruto is ladies and gentlemen is a quest of the imagination and an adventure of the soul, It ain't gonna tease your brain, It ain't gonna make you fall madly in love with characters in fact more than a few will piss you off BUT ladies and gentlemen what Naruto will do is have you coming back episode after episode like a crack cocaine fiend. How you ask? Why through none other than damn fine story telling, good and at times beautiful artwork and sheer blunt enjoyment. Time for some further detail folks. We gonna start with the good and work toward the worse here. STORY Most synopsis of Naruto state that it's the tale of a young boy Naruto Uzimaki and his quest to become the greatest village leader in the history of the village (Through brutal ninja slaughter of other villages) but i'd like to say that it's just the base story (there is a multitude of and intriguing mini stories and sub plots in Naruto). The real story in Naruto is about friendship, see people, in life friends sometimes grow apart, different interests and the pressures of life take their toll and people go their separate ways, it's happened to me and i'm sure it's happened to a few of you. This happens in Naruto and my boy Naruto say's ""f**k no"" leading to a fantastic adventure to regain what has been lost, truly touching stuff here folks. SOUND It took me a while to realize just how big of an effect the tunes in an anime,Tv show or movie has on the overall experience, due to this i decided to take a look back over Naruto and the soundtrack it provides for a better analysis. Hot damn was i happy with it, an almost perfect selection of songs that will have you feeling tense or at ease depending on the scene as well as songs that help portray mystery and wonder when necessary. In summary the soundtrack really helps compliment the whole atmosphere of the Naruto series. ART A lot of people doing reviews on Naruto will probably bitch about the artwork saying it's ""patchy"" and what not. Don't listen to em folks don't do it, see what these people don't realize is the cost,time and effort it takes for these companies to hire Pro animators who basically do slave work spending days on end animating a single scene. Naruto is one of the longest running manga/anime out there so its easy to imagine costs are high. It also provides excellent action sequences and when the Naruto series calls for good animation it delivers it, when it doesn't require it, it doesn't provide it simple as peoples. CHARACTERS Now if there were an area in which the Naruto series falls down for me it would surly be the characters.Why you ask? well because i feel that more than one of it's large ensemble of characters are incredibly one dimensional with the main focus of character development being on our two main characters and a handful of minor characters and even with this in mind the development of said characters is incredibly slow. Also with such a large ensemble of characters more than a few pissed me off with their quirky ways (Also Sakura is one of the most useless, worthless and genuinely SHIT female protagonists i've ever seen). Now if there is a saving grace for the characters of Naruto then for me it would be the antagonists, i say this because the series crafts them Lovely backstories that allows you to understand what lead them to their wicked ways rather than the usual bullshit in anime that has an evil character who is just evil for the heck of it. Terribly sorry about droning on here chaps so ima wrap this review up with a suggestion, don't analyze it, don't critique it and just sit back and enjoy it, if you watch it with the above in mind it's sure to be a roller coaster ride of epic fun. Peace Much Love Owen",8,Recommended,"Mar 27, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ffc1c38e51,14
"YoungChigga (All reviews) 0 people found this review helpful more pics Look this series has changed my life forever. I watched alot of smaller anime shows in the past and this was the first ever long show I ever watched. It turns out I liked long series and I have been watching short series my whole entire life. I usually do not like main characters with blonde hair but I started this series thinking that I was blonde or something I was delusional around December because it was delusional December. NARUTO: FIRST SERIES ------------------------------ Even though everything was good about the series the story was the best part. Out of all the anime I have ever watched I was never so engaged with a series like this one. What made the plot so good was because of how long it is and to be honest even if the show was 12 episodes like most of the shows I have watched in the past it could have been great still but not as good if the story was just in 12 episodes. In the beginning the story was great but compared to the future plot it was average. It was cool seeing how the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke started and the first couple episodes with Naruto playing around with Sasuke and Sakura was like a fun slice of life. It is so cool that all the characters from episode 1 still exist 700 episodes later in the boruto series. It is just really cool to see this. The first C mission they did was cool because you see Naruto being annyoing but super cool as well. The chunin exams to be honest were kind of the best thing I have ever watched. This anime season of Naruto was like th best even though it was realesed during 2003. Its crazy because this was made when I was born I legit was 0 years old well this was being animated even though it is weird because the manga started in 1999 this is crayz because it existed as long as spongebob. I use to think everything made before 2010 is trash but alot of old school things are cool. The chunin exam was the most smartest thing I have ever seen in the series like legit it rose my IQ. It was so funny when Naruto did not know like anything and he was just writing down nothing. Hinata and stuff was offering him questions and at this scene I got kind of pissed cause Naruto can not see that Hinata likes him its crazy. Anyway the exams in the beginning I could tell it took alot of thought. Anyway the second exam kind of reminding me of a battle royale because they are in the forest and teams are being elimanated. I was watching Naruto and this season around the time PUBG and fortnite was becoming popular. Its crazy because I thought minecraft hungergames in like 2011 than I learned about the Battle Royale Movie from like 2000's. Than this which was crazy. At the third exams when all those kids were fighting from the main characters. It really shows the personalities of the characters. Kiba vs Naruto was my third favorite fight because it was like dog vs fox because they both have animals inside of them. The hyuga clan fight was also lit as well even though Hinata loss but they got some bonding experience which I really enjoyed. The best fight was between Rock Lee and Gaara. Tbh I never really likes Gaara he reminds me of a messed up kid who has no friends. Legit I do not feel like I have empathy for this guy even over all his flashbacks. I feel like with the right personality you can make urself likeable even if you have an animals with tails. So Rock Lee when he took off those weights it legit got me fired up. Sorry about that fairytail reference. Look the Neji fight where he took revenge for Hinata when Naruto got those good speech. Legit everybody doubted Naruto. He showed his ninja way in that fight you know but I aint spoiling anything but that fight is the reason is why Naruto is Naruto. Look I had a handful of fights and though fights are not always like this. Look fights are one sided in real life but it is so cool to see fights where you see alot of comebacks. So the fight with Shikimaru look I cant say his name but that was pretty analytical and I kind of got pissed on what rank he became because of what he done because I feel like it should be someone more deserving with power. So Sasuke is really cool and was not my favorite in the beginning because I was not digging his blue shirt but later he becomes cool. In the beginning I feel like he did not know what he was doing but his Chidori was popping espically when he popped Gaaras little pimple looking barrier. Like what was he trying to finna do it was crazy. So anyway after that the fights between that puppet guy and Shino was decent not something to remember though. Anyways the training with Jiriya whats im talking bout was the funniest thing ever and how he was training for summoning or whatever. Anyways him using that in the fight with Gaara and saying how they had the same childhood or whatever was lit. To be honest I do not believe they the same. They may of had the same childhood but what about personalize wise. Naruto is cool and funny but Gaara is not. He gained his powers from birth and Naruto work hard for this also Rock Lee is lit. Bruh him training for 10 hours straight. 24/7 GRIND that is the Rock Lee way and his ninja way and he did not deserve what he got. Look Gaara thinks his life is so hard being op and whatever but no no no. Anyway lets talk about someone who does not work at all but is also lit and this is Choji. Choji has the nonstop grind on the food though. Like I love how he eats so much potato chips and ramen. Look I eat a lot of ramen and eat noodles. Kiba is lit but also I have a grudge against him because the way he talks to his dog is hella akward. I feel like this dood is a furry tbh but who cares anyway he still is lit. Neji is an okay character and reminds me of me when I was like 5 for reasons I will not tell you at all. So after the Gaara vs Naruto their was alot of filler episodes until when the gang which is Neji, Shikimarou, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto goes and tries to retrieve Sasuke from becoming evil. It was so cool seing each one of them going after a bad guy with 2x the amount of power but since they ninjas they still found away like ghost busters. So after all of these fights it made me realize their is alot more meaning to life even though I wasted alot watching Naruto. To be honest during this time I could of been spending time on so many other things but again im wasting my life and I do not even know why its crazy. I think thats it for the story and I would give it a 10 out of 10 ok. The art was from 2003 so I guess it was okay for 2003. The soundtrack for Naruto and openings pumped me up espically opening 2,5, and I think 8. Enjoyment was a 10 because of the ships. Overall a 10.",10,Recommended,"Aug 15, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_acf529b499,14
"Naruto is another in a long-line of popular shounen battle anime in its focus on the titular, simple-minded and obnoxious titular character desiring to become his village's leader through hard work and perseverance despite being a societal outcast because of being the human host for a demonic fox. Essentially, whatever typical shounen action anime tropes you can think of apply to much of what Naruto has to offer up from the titular character being a worst case of the simple-minded hero character than Dragon Ball's Goku, Sasuke being the revenge-seeking loner, Sakura the short-fused kunoichi with a single-minded interest in Sasuke, powerful sage Jiraiya being yet another dirty old man, and so forth. It also has some of the typical battle arc tropes of the genre such as Naruto and others seeking to grow stronger, a battle tournament, and a main villain attempting to wipe out the heroes throughout a good span of the series. The series does make its attempts at offering depth to its story and characters. It explores a number of the consequences that the ninja lifestyle has with affecting a number of characters that include the mental toll being a demonic host takes on Gaara and Orochimaru's quest for seeking knowledge on all ninja techniques leading him to continually manipulate others in his schemes. The development of Sasuke's character also leads to what is considered one of the franchise's best arcs with the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the orphaned Uchiha takes on his own plans to seek the revenge he wants. These more serious developments do lead to the mentioned obnoxious traits of the characters to be dialed back a bit as the series progresses, which leads it to actually be a little more engrossing as a result. Unfortunately like many titles of its ilk, Naruto does eventually find itself getting into filler arcs because of catching up with its manga source material. This especially gets bad after the end of the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the remaining 85 episodes of the series consist of nothing but filler thus leading the advancing plot to be dragged to an abrupt halt and be left incomplete until Naruto Shippuuden comes along. The fillers do make attempts at trying to develop some characters who otherwise didn't get much exposure in the series proper, some of this working well with Sakura and Hinata. But for the most part, the fillers are otherwise non-essential viewing thanks to their self-contained and anime-exclusive developments, and you could just as easily skip past them if you only wanted to watch the series up to the Sasuke Retrieval arc. In terms of artwork, scenery and character designs are reasonably detailed and well drawn though nothing out-of-the-ordinary for a 2000s anime. It makes use of a good number of animation shortcuts thanks to its long length, but has its occasional fluid movements in some of the anime's pivotal fights that include the climactic fight between Naruto and Sasuke during the Retrieval arc. Opening and ending musical tracks mostly milk use of J-rock and J-pop tracks, but the insert tracks consist of some catchy traditional beats with the use of drums, chanting, and instrumentation. While having its occasional moments of quality, Naruto still does ultimately suffer from a number of the typical pitfalls of the shounen action anime genre from its rehashing of the typical character and storyline elements of the genre, frequent use of animation shortcuts, and having a good helping of filler arcs. I would only recommend this title if you are a big fan of similar long-running shounen action titles like DBZ or Bleach.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 20, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ff8bd36af9,15

"There is no doubt that Naruto is one of the best classic Shounen anime. The story soundtrack character development is great, and most importantly Naruto has gifted some splendid fight scenes. I would have given it 10 out of 10 the only reason i deducted the two stars because of those continuous meaningless fillers. Fillers which have absolute no context to the original main arc, what is the meaning of having continuously straight 30-40 episodes fillers this breaks the continuity of a show and viewers gets easily bored.

"The fact that this show has an average rating below an 8 is just dreadful. This show was amazing. I went into this show thinking it would suck, and only wanted to watch it because I had no other show I could watch at the moment. The reason I hated Naruto so much before I saw it was because I loved Bleach and I was in that Bleach vs. Naruto argument. So no, I'm not one of those people who went into it because of hype, I had no good expectations for Naruto nor Naruto Shippuuden(still currently watching). Watching this show has exceeded my expectations by a million percent. Watching the first episode I was completely taken aback by the show. Remember, I was a big Bleach guy who had no good expectations for Naruto. However, this first episode was great. After that, I continued on with the story. As it progressed, my love for Naruto only grew larger. I loved the conflict that Naruto and Sasuke had with their own hidden demons. Honestly, I could relate on so many levels. And, of course, Gaara was the craziest thing ever, always love seeing him on screen. I love the relationships that the characters build throughout the series. I specifically love the relationship between Iruka-Sensei and Naruto, despite the fact that Iruka's parents were killed the 9 tailed fox, who dwells within Naruto in the 8 pronged seal. Kakashi-Sensei's and Sasuke have a great relationship. Pervy Sage, Naruto and Granny Tsunade's relationship was amazing. Kabuto and Orochimaru were a great duo. Even though many people dislike Sakura Haruno, I actually liked her in Naruto, although I can relate to the people who think she was pretty useless in battle. However, lets be honest; in Naruto Shippuuden she is extremely underrated and is great in that show. I can see why people don't like Sakura in the original Naruto though. The end fight scene is pretty awesome. I won't spoil who was in it but it got me pumped up for Naruto Shippuuden. I haven't watched the infamous filler arc yet and I don't know if I ever will. All in all, from what I saw from Naruto I give it a perfect 10/10. I also feel the same way about Naruto: Shippuuden so far, a show that I'm getting toward the end of. After that, I will watch all the Shippuuden filler and I will begin Boruto, and yes I know that the show is quite infamous at the moment. Final Thoughts? Both Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden are light years ahead of Bleach. I still haven't finished Bleach, and I'm still not planning to do so at the moment.",10,Recommended,"Aug 27, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb8c4d7afd,15
"Aight so people normally say Naruto is too overhyped and all that but homie went on that grind from zero to hero on god. Watching him start highkey trash at the simplest then push to progress was a ride for sure. Fairly would have rated overall 10 but there do be filler episodes that are kinda meh. Naruto is the storyline so these extra episodes can be sus. Visuals be above what you'd expect and you learn to even love it to a nostalgic point though in some fights, you may think to yourself they could have done more but not enough to ruin it lol. Audio is kinda jus like any other audio but it def matches what you see very well and gives you a good reason to watch. The character development is the whole ass reason we love Naruto. Homie was down bad and then begins to do something about it, it keeps you wanting him to get better.

"REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS Ah Naruto, one of the most popular anime ever. I am sure many people have seen it and have come here to see how others think about it, i will let you all know this is my first review. Many people think it is overhyped but i will let you all know i personally enjoyed this anime a lot. If you are worried about the number of episodes are too long or something then let me tell you the story will leave you wanting for more at the end of each episode. The entire series consists of comedy, emotional scenes which might teach viewers life lessons. Naruto teaching lessons may be an unpopular opinion. The art and sound is exceptional as the series started in 2002. Talking about character development- I think it has been done really well as each and every character except a few of course has been given proper time to develop. So it's not like Naruto will be the favourite character as the story contains of great heroes and villains. The entire story is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs, in some cases the characters might also relate to the characters connecting to their emotions and thoughts. The only negative part which me and others do not like about this show is that there are many filler episodes. Other than that i hope you all enjoy watching the show and feel free to refer to other reviews if you think i am being partial",9,Recommended,"Sep 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8d694af7e0,15
"Story: Naruto is about a boy who is misunderstood and Wants to become hokage someday. As it turns out he deals with lots of problems that your average person wouldn't deal with. For example: Being an outcast, Not having his parents around, Having to prove others wrong time and time again..... The story is basically about the main character and The story only gets better within the next series which is Naruto: Shippuden. Art: The art is much better than your average shounen, as a matter of fact I would go as far to say that it's better than the animation for Bleach and No, That isn't a joke either. The art style is close to being in the same tier as Fullmetal Alchemist or One Punch Man. Sound: The Intros/Outros are something that Naruto does perfectly and You can tell from the amazing Rock n Roll or Japanese Folk music being played. Simply put the amount of Intros/Outros within this anime are amazing and It would be hard for me to even choose a favorite for either topic. Character Development: Character development is obviously there, as we see Naruto mature more and more. In the beginning you would get this immature and annoying vibe from him, but Later on in the series you see he starts to mature and Becomes more serious about his dreams. Side characters also have development which is always a good thing. Cause your average shounen hardly ever pays attention to the side characters. Personal Enjoyment: I personally enjoyed Naruto very much and Would like to thank my Little brother for getting me into Naruto in the first place. As a matter of fact all my friends we're into Naruto. From buying the games for Gamecube and Playstation to buying the merchandise and The posters and So on and So fourth. I really did enjoy the show that much! Overall: In all honesty Naruto is an Amazing anime and People need to see it before hating on it. It's has everything that most people would enjoy from Character development, Perfect intros/outros, and Overall a great story. I rate Naruto a 9 OUT OF 10 Naruto is an Amazing Anime!

"This is my first review so lets get this started..... Naruto..... A good ass anime, for the people who don't have taste in this anime or say this anime is trash only loves the anime's with overpowered anime emo boys with busty girls crawling all over him, anyways. The story: a solid 5 strait filler besides from the Sasuke retrieval ark the best ark in the anime. The Art: A 5 if you didn't watch Naruto Shonen Jump in 2012 you thought this was the best art in the world! The art did have its flaws. The Sound: Solid 4 while watching the anime in dub, with some characters just listening was strait torture to my ears. characters: An 8 amazing characters, for example, Rock Lee a character born without jutsu spends his life striving for the best of the best only using tijutsu. Another character is Kakashi hes a chill character and he has a good design. One of favorite characters is Zabuza even though he is dead great character. enjoyment: Solid 8 have you seen the fights..... Good ass choreograph! good ass fights! But the plot is trash i guess. Overall: Solid 9 The fights are to be praised don't believe me take a look on YouTube, the story.... nah i guess its good. good Sasuke retrieval ark how could you not love this anime. bruh I am telling you if you don't love this anime with good fights you must only like the anime's like non-action or slice of life or other lame shit like that.",9,Recommended,"Apr 5, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e7326143c4,15

The show most definitely had it's flaws, but it never ceased to amaze me with the story. The fights were beautiful and the second and fifth arc were possibly one of the best arcs in anime. I wish I could go into greater detail on why this was so good, but I would have to spoil the show for newcomers that want to check out Naruto. To all the newcomers, Watch this show, Period. The bar set by this franchise was so high, I have yet to see a show other than FMA, AOT, OP, Bleach and HXH come even CLOSE to how good this anime was and this was in 2002. I wasn't even born yet!

"Naruto is the anime that accompanied me from my childhood to adolescence until early adulthood, and I feel the series have a lot of love because of this personal experience from the fans. The story is typical of a hero (Naruto) passing through various difficulties and challenges, but the ninja world, all the jutsus and emotive moments give the show its uniqueness. Every character has a distinct personality, and the episodes present you different perspectives of goof and evil, right and wrong, and of course Naruto trying to convince them to change their ways, and being influenced and growing out of those experiences. All of that is covered with a lot of action, fights, and mysterious stuff. I recommend that you watch it all, even if you feel the first episodes art is crap, because they are the foundation for your attachment to the characters.

Hello back with a review for naruto p1 The story: at the first 2 arcs it was really decent but once the konoha attack started it became serious and amaaing specially akatsuki which are really interesting. it got some silly moments and fillers are really bad but its not a problem just skip them. the first arc story was just good for a prologue its gave us an amazing backstory between zabusa and the other guy. the chunin exam was really boring and a part of any exam arc in anime until orochimaru appeared it got us interested. who's that guy? whats his goal? many other things konoha attack arc was awesome got the best fights specially the hokage level fight the building of orochimaru and gaara is perfect for a psycho path character. search for tsunade welcomed a really interesting organization got us wondering who exactly are they. the last arc was really decent bad pacing but its idea is cool and the development of sauske. I rate the story 9/10 The art: really decent don't ever think of pausing you will see the worst frames ever but in normal watching its just good so 9/10 no one would feel that without pausing sound: 10/10 easily sad themes are great and it suits the events character: naruto always develops and not the same unlike some mc's like luffy. he's not the most stupid he's just normally stupid. Every side character got a backstory and a motivation and a goal which is perfect no would like more than that some great characters like orochimaru and itachi made the anime more enjoyable. sauske and naruto development is perfect too and sauske is following the same path as his brother to get power. 10/10 for me enjoyment: Omg the pacing of chunin exams decreased the enjoyment with a crazy way but everything else was enjoyable the psycho path characters gave a special mood so 9/10 overall: 9/10,9,Recommended,"Aug 8, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_101efad739,15

This show brings about some of the coolest and heartwarming moments that I have ever seen in anime. I felt so attached to each character. Their best moments, their power ups, their lessons that connected to life, and even some deaths brought me speechless.

"There is no need to introduce Naruto to anyone. Everybody knows it, even people who are not into anime. This manga has become extremely popular, and even though it is over, it lasted long. STORY As in every long shônen anime, a lot happens in Naruto. We follow the everyday like of Naruto, an orphan rejected by his own village, in this world of shinobis who work for a living taking missions with their team. We see these Shinobi pass exams to level up, take missions, and fight several threats including Gaara who has a demon inside him, Orochimaru who tries to destroy Konoha, and the Akatsuki, a group with unknown purpose. Now, the story is what makes Naruto popular. I can understand that. I actually would like the story... if it wasn't so non-concise and full of fillers. Want an example? Just look at the 80 fillers in the end of the series ; or take a look at the Chunin Exam arc, which lasts 40 episodes (JUST FOR AN EXAM). Basically, not only Naruto is extremely full of fillers, even the main story is very slow. As a result, it feels like nothing happened. MUCH MORE should have happened in those 220 episodes. Hell, some anime with 50 episodes or less have as much story as Naruto! As good as the story sometimes gets, there's just too few (compared with the number of episodes). ART Naruto is... not very good. The chara-design is weird and doesn't follow any logic, the drawings are bad and the animation is disgusting. That said, the art does get better with time. I like some openings. SOUND The OST is very basic, if not bad at all. The themes stick to the Ninja theme, though. The seiyuus are good. CHARACTER That's both the main weakpoint AND the stronghold of Naruto. - First, let's talk about the secondary characters. They're a bunch of useless crap with no charisma, who sometimes show an interesting attack/power just to try and get the viewer's attention for a bit. - Then, there are the main characters. The Uchiwas are awesome, and thank god the story revolves a lot around them. Sasuke is often criticized as he is ""just an edgy character"" ; I personally liked following his path into darkness, although I am not a huge fan either. Sakura is a useless chick and she just doesn't even deserve to be a main character. There's nothing to argue here. Then, there is Naruto. Ah, Naruto. If he does get an interesting journey, as he evolves through the various dangers he encounters, in this first part of the manga he is a really annoying brat. Basically, 90% of the characters are useless and uninteresting 95% of the time, and even the main characters are really lackluster as Sakura is useless, Sasuke is too edgy and Naruto is a brat. Luckily, some characters do stand out, especially Itachi and Kakashi. But it's not enough to change the fact that the Naruto crew is really screwed up. ENJOYMENT I read the manga and did enjoy some parts. I watched the anime and really hated it. As an anime, it fails ; as a story, the huge amount of fillers and the very slow pace makes it really annoying to watch.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 14, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1127cfe985,15

I always say that a soundtrack can make or break a series. The Characters were perfect. You get a lot of enjoyment from this show. The one problem I had with it was ALL those fillers! But, I can let that slide:) Overall, I would say this show will forever stay in the hearts of those who grew up with it.",10,Recommended,"Feb 1, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4228e7fd12,15
"You gotta watch Naruto. It has a total of 220 episodes but without fillers it's around 100. ( skip the fillers, the good ones are in Shippuden, not here ) First off, you're gonna know the name of everyone from his village which is pretty cool to begin with. You'll find the hand seals pretty satisfying and most characters come out as very cool and chill. Each character brings something very significant to the table. The action is epic and it's pretty funny at times. The walk through Naruto's life is emotional occasionally but really gets you motivated, dattebayo! The protagonist Uzumaki Naruto defies limit time and time again, it's heartwarming. Story of Uchiha Sasuke is one you'd not wanna miss. With that said, you must watch Naruto Shippuden too, 500 Eps but less than 350 without fillers, though some are good. Shippuden is just sooo much better.( flashbacks are outrageous ) I'd say Naruto is the ladder to get to the real deal that is Naruto Shippuden but don't get me wrong, Naruto is not to be underestimated. There are two fights which are on par with the greatest fights in Narutoverse.( You'll understand once you see them ) The hype for villains is unparalled The OP's( Opening Sequences ) are pretty dope too!. I hope you actually get into the Narutoverse coz of my elaborate recommendation. I believe i have hyped it enough for you without any spoilers, although with spoilers his would have been 4x easier. Enjoy Watching !",9,Recommended,"Jul 27, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_89dd29e1b9,15
"Naruto (and Shippuden) is one of my favourite creations, not just within anime but in media overall. This is in spite of a few flaws, which I will outline along with its' strongest elements. The story is a well-paced, exciting, and focused adventure. Naruto sets out his goal from episode 1, and never strays, though he has much to learn. By episode 4, the friendship, intrigue and rivalry that will be of overarching importance right till the very end is well established. One possible exception to this is episode 2, which focuses on a character who is fairly minor, but in my opinion, really annoying. But again, he's a minor character, so it's a small gripe. Though the anime follows perilous fights and tragic characters, it has many light-hearted scenes and downright goofy moments that give it a grounding as an optimistic show. It has minimal fanservice. It doesn't fall into the 'monster of the week' format (at least the non-filler episodes) nor is it bound by being seasonal - it takes exactly as much time as it needs for each arc, and gives good build up for the introduction of new major characters, including truly mysterious and intimidating villains. Speaking of which, here lies Naruto's greatest strength: a compelling cast of fleshed out characters. Like many shounen stories, Naruto has a large cast, but it never feels TOO big. This is down to smart and memorable character design, and the time spent getting to know each one through a mixture of battles and flashbacks. This creates a wealth of characters with varied motivations worth rooting for. While Naruto himself certainly annoys the people around him, he avoids annoying the viewer. His sympathetic background, the motivation for his behaviour, and his optimistic, good-hearted nature make him an endearing protagonist that you can believe in. Naruto's perfect foil, Sasuke, while certainly part of an 'edgy boy' trope that you either love or hate, is every bit as compelling. His overarching backstory and development is central to the series, and one of the most enjoyable elements. To accompany the action is some great music. Toshiro Masuda's score blends traditional Japanese elements with invigorating battle music, giving a unique and memorable tone. This mirrors the setting of the series, which draws on old Japanese folklore and modern fantastical elements. Overall it is an OST that I have kept in rotation for over 10 years. There are some suitably badass opening songs (Re:member and Yura Yura are my own favourites), and sweet melancholic ending songs (the very first ending, Wind, remains the most memorable across this and Shippuden). Personally, I've always watched the English dub, and I find it perfectly satisfying. I've watched odd episodes and compilations with the Japanese audio and that seems good too; I haven't detected any big shift in tone from one to the other. The art is pleasant and fair quality throughout, with an obvious focus on fast-paced fighting animations. While there are many fantastical battle elements that are exciting to watch, some of the best moments are in more simple, hand-to-hand combat, where the brutality of each move is felt (a particularly good example of this is in episode 85). The show also doesn't hold back from goofy, cartoon-ish frames to accompany light-hearted moments. The palette remains vibrant throughout, which I'm sure helps it appeal to younger viewers, but is not so garish as to put off older viewers. Now, one big potential drawback of Naruto is a heavy volume of filler episodes, even by the standards of its' peers. Fortunately, this series is laid out so that the vast bulk of filler comes in the last 84 episodes, meaning the first 136 are all pretty much essential viewing and advance the story. After getting that far into the series, you're well able to decide whether to watch some of these episodes or to skip ahead to Shippuden - most of the filler is enjoyable, if not all that memorable. Another element that has been the subject of plenty of gentle fun-poking over the years is how many battles are drawn out over multiple episodes, with excessive recaps thrown in. This, combined with the use of flashbacks during battle sequences, can slow the overall pace down quite a bit. This is a legitimate criticism, but not one that spoils the show, for me at least. For viewers wanting fast, shorter battles, and a quick resolution to the story, this may be too frustrating to get past. However, this happens because Naruto isn't a 'monster of the week' kind of show (I guess it would be 'mission of the week' in any case); each enemy is treated as interesting and important - even the earliest opponents Naruto's team faces are remembered by the characters and still influence them all the way down the line in Shippuden. Overall, I enjoy Naruto more than any other anime series. It was the first shounen series that I watched, but I have still not found another to top it. While at first I was intimidated by the sheer volume of episodes to get through, by the time I first finished the whole series I actually found myself immediately rewatching all the story episodes again before moving on to Shippuden! It remains a heartening, life-affirming story that I continue to dabble in, and one which I will revisit throughout my life. For viewers looking for a gritty, or cynical anime, this won't satisfy you. Naruto is relentless in his will to never give up on himself or his friends, which is the central joy of the show. If you're a fan of the genre then it is surely worth your time. As an introduction to shounen anime I think it is also a worthy series; a simple premise and lovable characters will let you know within a few short episodes whether or not it is for you.",10,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bad8bb5004,15
"After watching the entire of Naruto (fillers and all), I give the show a score of 8. It's not the best anime by any means' but it definitely has an endearing quality to it. If you're thinking about watching, go in knowing that there will be tedious fillers and that the show is not perfect, just enjoy the little details like character quirks and jokes which make Naruto great on a whole. In the first episode I did not like the main character, Naruto, at all but once I got into the main arc, I had come to appreciate him and eventually through out the 220 episodes it was as if I was watching my brother grow up. The show brings a nostalgia, which is something I think is very difficult to achieve, I felt tremendously sad watching the last episode. Story line up until episode 130 was extremely engaging but after that the fillers spoiled it. The art is standard, it gets the story across but considering the how long ago it was created very understandable. The music of OP and ED were outstanding, I still have the songs in my head till this day and I don't think I will forget them anytime soon. All the characters have at least one good attribute (shout out to kakashi hatake, he made the show completely worth watching). I recommend this greatly, just give it sometime to grow on you.

"Saw this anime when I was a kid but never really finished it nor watched it religiously, then when I moved country I needed a show that somewhat feels like home al and saw this on Netflix, finished the whole thing so fast, that time Shippuden's dubbed wasn't finish yet so I watched it on subbed, just my own preference I like dubbed more coz I hate reading subtitles.. I wanna see the characters facial reactions into detail.. just me. LOVE the character development. Rewatched it early this year again, from Naruto to shippuden, and the movie, the nostagia is the same. the whole NARUTO is overall my favourite anime, and will let my kids watch this someday.",10,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2022",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_243dd49a56,15
