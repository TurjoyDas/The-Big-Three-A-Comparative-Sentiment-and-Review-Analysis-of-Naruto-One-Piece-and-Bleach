"This anime has a disastrous montage. Burn The Witch is anything but a movie. The biggest problem that prevents any internal logic is the way it was distributed by Crunchyroll. The movie was perforated like a seasonal anime, and the transition between the 3 episodes is disastrous, the narrative tone of each episode gives the feeling that the story is going to be much bigger than it really is. In the little show time we have, the anime tries to develop an internal problem that doesn't work or just doesn't matter, and tries to assimilate that with a drama of some characters that does not move. When I finished watching, it got that feeling of something unfinished. It can even be a very rich anime visually, but it does not explore any of this, the anime universe is very artificial, it seems that the characters were taken from another world, and played there in the middle. To conclude, Burn The Witch was not able to enchant at any time thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers who seem to me to have prioritized a visual part without correctly assimilating it as the work's unity.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_aaf851ef92,1
"Well, this movie was nice to watch. It really brought back that Bleach nostalgia. While I can't even to begin to express how glad I am that I could experience Burn The Witch immediately as it released, it wasn't a flawless masterpiece. It tried to tell way too much story that could naturally fit in a one hour movie. The world building wasn’t as strong as it could have been. If only this movie had an extra 20-30 minutes to its runtime, like a normal length animated feature, it would have flowed a lot smoother and could have fleshed out the characters and world a bit more. Some things weren't explained fully and the characters didn't have enough time to become fully developed. This is especially true for Balgo, who is easily the flattest and least interesting character in the movie. There is a moment at the end of the movie where two characters hug (sort of), and it feels so random and comes so out of nowhere, that you would think that there actually was a prequel movie to this, since nothing in the movie made it seem like they were on hugging terms. Another flaw I would give this movie would go to the animation team at studio Colorido. While the fight scenes were well animated for the most part, a lot of the still frames felt stiff. While that may seem like an obvious thing to say, it felt stiffer than most still frames feel. Some of the CG was off-putting as well, but most of the CGI was integrated well. Now for the positives, as I said before, the action scenes were well animated for the most part. They were very slickly and stylishly animated and the CGI was integrated well most of the time. The Marchen (legendary dragon) was animated nicely as well. The entire backstory scene with Macy and Elly was presented wonderfully. The ED song was nice and the soundtrack fit. The voice cast was all solid as well. Most of the cast had great designs. The character designs were very Bleach-like and they looked great in this setting. Also, it is just nice to see the Bleach references and to just be back in the world of Bleach. The main characters, Noel and Ninny, are really likable (even if not fully developed), and they really had a natural and believable chemistry between them. This movie was enjoyable, although I went in to the movie already loving it, so I have a bias. That being said, I think that non-Bleach fans will have a harder time enjoying it than Bleach fans. There will probably be more animated Burn The Witch content down the road, so it will be interesting to see where the series goes from here. All in all, an 8 out of 10.",8,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_272fddb1a8,1
"Burn the witch made me feel like I was watching the 6th episode (and only the 6th episode) in a 12 episode series. The first part of the anime jumps straight into action with minimal information. We get about 2 minutes of the anime establishing the setting, another 2 minutes of vague implications about who and what people are, and then all of a sudden we’re fighting dragons in the middle of the street. The lack in background isn’t so bad that you can’t follow what’s going on, but the anime would have been a million times better if everything had been laid out properly before the plot started escalating (which is how stories usually work). On a positive note, I thought the sounds were amazing. The greatest selling point of this anime would probably be the background music which fit the scenes very well. The music had a magical vibe that was perfect for the plot. It was also very innovative since it combined different kinds of sounds: modern sounds, orchestral sounds, and even some really cool vocals. I enjoyed the effects and outro too. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_881af0dfbb,1
"Oh my, the time has finally come for Burn the Witch, a much-anticipated movie constantly advertised by your favorite streaming site: Crunchyroll. I can best describe this movie as average and enjoyable. In fact, I can't even call this a movie, maybe an OVA would better describe it. Let me start off with the first thing that greets you when you watch an anime, the animation. I must say Studio Colorido has done a great job at animating this movie, the fight scenes are visually pleasing and the movements are fluid, there's no sign of shoddy work done by a bunch of underpaid chumps. Although some frames felt a bit jagged and stiff, great work! I will also praise the character designs which fit perfectly into the setting. Now onto the story and let me say this again, it's nothing special. Just your average shounen anime, fights, drama, and bam that's that. Although they did a decent job explaining the backstories everything just felt a bit rushed, if this movie was maybe 30-50 minutes longer, they could've executed this a bit better. MC's are likable, nothing special, there's chemistry but at the same time it doesn't feel as fully built as it should be, the ending scene seemed completely out of place. Then there's Balgo, who is so damn bland, so boring that even some plain tart from Yogurtland had more ""spice."" I understand there wasn't much material to work with, but everything felt extremely rushed. In summation, Burn the Witch is an enjoyable movie, albeit with no depth in any way. Visually rich but falls short when you take the story into account. Nothing more than your average shounen anime as I previously stated. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_79c2b0ff16,1
"Holy mother of kino. I completely expected a soulless cashgrabbing garbage to fund Bleach 2021, but I was absolutely surprised. Burn the Witch is the only anime I didn't drop at episode 1 in 2020, and not because other shows this year were absolutely horrible, they were, but Burn the Witch is so god damn good. Let's get this out of the way. I am a fan of Bleach, been one for some 12 years now. But these 3 episodes, or should I say, 1 movie, took me in way faster than anything Bleach EVER did. Interesting characters? Check. Amazing power system? Check. Amazing animation? Check. Bleach references? Check. Kubo once again showed why he is a master of character design, if not story telling at least. But BTW GENUINELY has a great premise. The series fully deserves to be completely adapted, and I can easily see it overcoming Bleach, in both quality and popularity. To keep this short, it's an amazing watch, doesn't even matter if you saw/read Bleach or not. This movie is absolute quality of the highest standard, and it is surprising it comes from a hack like Kubo, who butchered the ending of Bleach. Give it a watch, for sure.",10,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_d199fdb211,1
"What you need to know about this movie is that this is only season 1, which most people seem to not be aware of. There will be a season 2 for the manga which will more than likely be animated as well. On the production side, there is nothing to complain about. The animation is totally smooth and nowhere does it ever drop in quality. The ED theme is beautiful. The sound designer didn't do that annoying thing where they just added a ton of bass to every explosion/hit and crunched it. The comedy was on point, the character designs are all unique, the voices fit every character to a tee. Good job Studio Colorido. The plot for this first arc was very clear and concise. Every character had a unique personality nor did they seem cookie cutter. Season 1 did an excellent job of providing a foundation for the chapters to come. The viewer immediately gets a sense of the world the characters live in and its rules. Despite its short run time, I totally felt the emotions of certain characters and have become attached to quite a few that aren't the protagonists. There's just too many good things to say about Kubo's BTW and Studio Colorido. Stan Noel.",10,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_667ed46cc2,1
"For those of you - like me - who have never watched Bleach, I wouldn't pay too much attention to the fans who are saying ""non-fans might not enjoy it."" Perhaps Burn The Witch makes some references that went completely over my head as a non-fan, but there wasn't a single moment that I felt like I was out of the loop. Sure, the story suffers from being so short - time constraints mean having to dump the viewer right in the middle of the action. I agree with the criticisms that say this feels like a 12 episode show and we're starting on episode 4, but I think overall they did a good job of establishing relationships, each character's personality & motivations, and a pretty significant amount of worldbuilding in just 1 hour. Everything left me wanting more, and I PRAY that one day this gets picked up as a full series, even if it gets handed off from the author to a studio for them to make their own thing out of it. (Maybe it wouldn't be as good then, maybe it would be best to keep the author on as a director/helper in the script department or whatever, I'm just hypothesising here after all...) Animation was top notch, and they really got the ""feel"" of central London down pretty well. In fact the only other show I recall getting it close to spot-on is Princess Principal. (Even Magus Bride's rendition feels kind of one-dimensional and fictional/idealized, though that one gets praised a lot. But I mean that's just my own opinion.) The OST was pretty sparse overall but what *was* there was great. I actually need to do a quick re-watch because there was one song in there somewhere that I liked a lot...

"I gotta say,Kubo sensei really did a solid job with this one. Being a Bleach fanboy,anything from Tite Kubo goes into my watchlist without me giving it a second thought. ""Burn the Witch"" was no exception in this case. When the one-shot came out,I didn’t really feel the urge to get into it. But after the serialization,I got the drive force to give the manga and the adaptation a try and it sure as hell didn’t disappoint me. In simple terms,I would say,""Burn the Witch"" felt like an anime version of J.K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts(Hey,Harry Potter fans! Did I catch your attention with that?). But,firstly,let me clear up the confusion you’re in right now of whether this is a sequel to Bleach or is it a seperate story. It doesn’t directly involve the characters from Bleach but it does occur in the same universe. Ok.Let's get into it. The show does feel a lot like Bleach as the characters are a lot similar. But it actually works and doesn’t feel like a repetive out of place setup. The basic concepts are pretty much the same. MC is a human,he gets involved with an other worldly girl with powers and the girl is a part of a police force that supervises the control of other creatures in her reality. It does have fun characters and the story itself is interesting. Although,I would've loved to see more of the story as a one hour movie kind of felt short as it's set up in the universe of a long running anime. The animation wasn’t top notch throughout the whole thing but it's still pretty solid. The fights were perfectly done with great animation and amazing sound effects. Athough,One of the negative points this show has is that it might not be appealing to someone who's not familiar with stories from Kubo as this one attracted Bleach fans the most. If you haven’t watched it yet,step back as I'm about to spoil the story now- Earlier in the review,I did mention about this show being a lot like Fantastic Beats. So,let's look into that. Instead of the Obscurus,we have a featherless chicken that turns into a disney princess after losing contact with it's owner(I said that because it's name was Cinderella after the transformation). In case of the characters,Balgo feels like a blend of Ichigo and Kon,Noel feels like a fusion of Orihime and Unohana,Ninny feels like a combination of Hiyori and Yoruichi and Bruno is like a mixture between Grimjow and Bazz B. I liked Noel's tsundere act at the end and the Bleach logo inside the Burn the Witch logo was definitely clever. In conclusion,it's a solid and entertaining show and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",8,Recommended,"Mar 14, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_8ee8f54288,1
"Man, people out here judging this anime for being a lackluster ""1 hour montage"" judging it as if it was a one shot movie. This is not the end of the story, the manga is getting a continuation and I'm totally into this story and hoping for way, way more. The fantasy dragon bleach-esque setting is really cool, the characters are all very enjoyable to watch and they have so much depth to the character design. The author has obviously put a lot of thought into this world and I'm looking forward to see much more of it. Studio Colorido did a great job with the animation, the art style is fantastic as well.

"I'm not the type of person who gets into every single detail and I'm also not really good at writing reviews so please don't come at me (pls). Story: It just has your usual find a problem, fix it, then there's another problem and at least one character has the desire to fix it all on their own but is backed up by the main crew later on. Also has your typical higher-up people who are like, ""We're gonna take care of it, stay out of our way!"" and one of the main characters (or just one, but we have a duo) is like, ""Nope, can't do!"" and goes all out to be a hero in the end. I think we've all seen these scenarios and the anime directors seem to can't get enough of it, so they don't wanna try to be original. If you're gonna use this scenario, I always hope it's at least interesting and unique from the others and this anime got off the hook with it, but barely passed. Art: It looks like a typical anime design (and it is), but they kept it clean and consistent, even during the fighting animations. I really like how each character looks the best rather than the scenery. The scenery barely changed throughout the movie anyway. But I like the designs and the dragon designs were nice as well. Job well done. Sound: I don't really pay attention to OSTs, but they have to be unique and good for me to notice it and even start listening to it. If I like an opening/ending, it has to be good. The ending of the first two eps were okay, but the ending on the last ep really got me jamming. So my score is a 7 just because of that ending. Character: This movie did a good job including all the typical characters: loud and determined one, reserved and follows the rules, the pervert, the one who cares about people, and the reckless with the most self confidence. I'm not gonna say who's which because I don't want to put any spoilers, but at least every character was likeable (for me, at least). Enjoyment: I actually really liked it, even though it was such a basic anime. If a basic anime goes right, it actually turns out to be really good. The plot itself was definitely not interesting, but the animation and characters made up for some of it. Overall: I'm not picky when it comes to watching anime and if you look at my list, you can tell I don't really give any bad ratings. Most of the bad ratings are in my dropped list, but when it comes to watching till the end, it shows that I enjoyed it some way. I know a lot of people thought it was just average and nothing special, but if you're looking for a refresher, this anime might just do the trick.",8,Recommended,"Oct 5, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_48be98e374,1
"I will keep this short and pretty spoiler free, I'm not the best at reviews but I hope this helps :) Overall 8/10 I would say overall, give it a go, the story was lacking in some parts and the ending was a bit of a let down, but it was still fun to watch. I think the art was amazing and really suited the story, I would've liked it better if it was a longer (and more 'fleshed' out) anime but we can enjoy what we have got, so I say give it a go, its not bad at all, although there is room for improvement. Story 8/10 To be honest, the story was a lot different than what I was expecting, but it was enjoyable except for the few plot holes and things that just didn't make sense. I feel like the story was a bit underdeveloped, but in the end it was pretty good. I will say though, the ending was a bit of a let down, it was very different to what I thought was going to happen but I personally think the ending was a bit eh Art 10/10 I absolutely adore the art, I think it is super pretty and it created a nice atmosphere, I would watch it again just for the art Sound 7/10 I dont have much to say here since it was mainly just sound effects and stuff, but they were good Characters 9/10 I really liked most of the characters, they were enjoyable and I liked watching how they interacted with each other, especially ninny and noel. I liked their personalities for the most part and they made it much more enjoyable to watch the anime since they weren't very dull Enjoyment 8/10 I did enjoy watching it, I feel like this would've been much better if it had been longer and more fleshed out, as the story felt like it was missing something, but overall pretty good to watch and its not long or anything",8,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_7802ea6ef3,1

"(This is my first review, so go easy on me...) I see a lot of people giving Burn The Witch mediocre reviews, and I think that's in-part due to the of the way the film is organized. Burn The Witch is split up into three twenty minute long ""episodes"", which ends up making it feel more like a mini-series rather than a film. As a result, it barely manages to offer up an hour of content, and viewers are left only wishing that there was more. Is that really a bad thing, though? For what content is provided, I feel as though the writers did an excellent job of answering most of the big questions, and left enough unanswered to make me wish it was a full series. In that way, this feels more like one really long pilot episode... which just happens to be split up into three episodes. Confusing, right? Is it a mini-series, a film, or a pilot episode? In any event, there seems to be a lot of meat left on the bone. The world of Burn The Witch has a lot to offer, with an interesting magic system and dragon species galore. It feels like if Harry Potter was set in the Bleach universe. That description doesn't give it enough credit though, because Burn The Witch stands alone from Bleach. It's a spin on that universe so creative that I couldn't believe it was set in the same world. The characters are endearing (albeit a little shallow on the surface), and their personalities mesh well with one-another. It's unfortunate that the run-time wasn't longer, because they didn't truly have any time to develop. This also leaves the characters being this film's weakest aspect. However, that isn't to say it detracts from the entertainment factor. I found it to be hugely entertaining, with fantastic visuals and a great score. TL;DR - It's good. Enjoy it for what it is, and don't let people's negative opinions stop you from enjoying it.",8,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_d2cac438fe,1
"(This is the first time I write a review) The anime has a low rating on MAL mainly because the reviewers aren’t aware that it’s an ongoing series. The creator has confirmed a second season. The plot is concise and to the point. There weren’t unnecessary dialogues between characters meaning that the forward button isn’t tempting. The characters’ designs fit their personalities.

"Never have I seen an anime from a manga adapted from the author of Bleach that had turned out so good. Burn the Witch is without a doubt one of the best animated films/anime (regardless of the three-episode count) I have ever seen in 2020-2021. ---STORY--- Rating: 9 The story was set up very well with the concept on the setting of Reverse London which plays a huge part in the anime and its lore. The plot turned out to become interesting for the most part as the story advances throughout the story, though at some points may make viewers feel like the story has nothing special. However, besides the speed bumps that had underwent in the plot, I do think there are some parts in Burn the Witch that may be special in particular. The set up of Burn the Witch even reminded me of the Little Witch Academia series I watched a while back, which they are both some of the great witch anime as well. The character development here and there was evermore interesting, especially for characters Ninny Spangcole, Noel Niihashi and Macy Baljure. One scene particularly in the first act and the climax was intense and had a ton of action that is worth entertaining for many. ---ART--- Rating: 9 The art direction in Burn the Witch was pretty spectacular with the landscapes, the vastness in the environment of London/Reverse London, and the production/set design in some of the settings in the anime. There were even some scenes with amazing art in particular that help play out some of the great cinematography/layout that the film has in some sequences. ---SOUND--- Rating: 10 The sound design (mixing/editing) was incredible in Burn the Witch, alongside the fantastic original score/music composed by Keiji Inai. Though the anime has perfect voice acting and the action sequences incorporate great dragon/magic sound effects, the film orchestrates a various array of using a mix of sound effects and voice acting in some parts in a wonderful display of sound mixing/editing in anime that immerses viewers into their world. The ED song, Blowing, is no doubt harmonious. ---CHARACTERS--- Rating: 10 Along with the major and technical specs Burn the Witch had to offer as well as its imaginative character design, the characters/voice acting was the main highlight of the anime for me. Asami Tano (english dub actress Olivia Hack of Avatar: TLA and Bratz fame) has brought humor, drama and passion to her role as Ninny Spangcole, in which her character examples ambition, beauty, magical and complexion in the anime. Ninny has a tour-de-force powerhouse anime performance that I believe that she is one of the best anime girls of the year and is one of the best animated performances in my opinion this year. Yuina Yamada (english dub actress Allegra Clark) on the other hand also brought serenity, empathetic and splendor as the other main Noel Niihashi, who also brings sensitivity, courage and teamwork in every scene she's in. Saori Hayami (english dub actress Brianna Knickerbocker) apparently has one of the strongest roles/performances in the anime, exemplifying shrewdness, emotion and even humor in her role as Macy Baljure, in which, alongside Ninny, is one of the best characters in the anime and has one of the best developed character developments and backstories, showing melancholy, dignity and/or comedy in many of her scenes. Other major supporting characters in the anime, including male characters Balgo Ywain Parks (played by Shimba Tsuchiya (english dub actor Griffin Burns)) and Bruno Bangnyfe (played by Chikahiro Kobayashi (english dub actor Sean Chiplock from Re:Zero)), has shown promising and intriguing roles by playing crucial parts to the story alongside the other characters. Osushi was at least pretty cute too. ---ENJOYMENT--- Rating: 10 Hands down, I have enjoyed every minute of Burn the Witch, if its not the best anime ever (since there's also Ghibli and other anime films/series out there that are animated masterpieces). If I made my own animation awards for films and series, I'd definitely contend/nominate it for one or some awards. I know some people don't agree that Burn the Witch is great, but I for one loved it. Ninny, Noel and Macy are the best characters in Burn the Witch, in my opinion. The director, Tatsuro Kawano, has made a mesmerizing debut in his first anime direction for Burn the Witch after his commitments to key animation in various animes. ---OVERALL--- Rating: 10 (96% as a percentage) Burn the Witch was a splendorous, whimsical wonderment that's ever been adapted from a manga by the author of Bleach. I hope more of the story is told later on with a sequel in the near future, because I would love to see where their next adventures would take them next. The story was amazing with a faithful adaptation to the manga, the artwork is well done, the sound design is immersive/innovative with the use of magic/dragon sound effects, the characters along with its designs and developments absolutely shine in every scene, and the anime itself is impactful, especially for diehard Tite Kubo and Bleach fans.

"Burn the Witch is a joke. A sad, overhyped joke. I personally have not seen Bleach, so I would not understand the connections between this miniseries and Bleach, but I feel like I don't have to to be critical of this pure waste of time. While Burn the Witch is incredibly well-animated, it's so devoid of substance that I couldn't feel any emotion towards this whatsoever. All I could think was that I was glad it only lasts an hour so I wouldn't waste any more of my time on it. There are so many pieces introduced that don't end up playing any role in the show's outcome, and the pieces that do play a role are really stupid. For example, Balgo is one of the worst characters I have ever seen in an anime. His only purpose in the story is to be protected for reasons that are far beyond me, there is no indication as to what his relationships to Noel or Ninny are, and he somehow ends up as a Mary Sue in the very end. What hurts the most is that far more interesting characters get no development whatsoever. Ninny is a protagonist that simply exists, without getting nearly enough of the backstory or development she could have used to become a good protagonist. And yet somehow, Noel gets even LESS development. The show just leaves you with so many more questions than answers because it's so dedicated to the idea of doing nothing with its characters. Burn the Witch also has perhaps one of the worst climaxes I've seen in an anime. In retrospect I'm glad I felt nothing towards it because if I had somehow become invested in these characters I'm sure the final battle would have been even MORE insulting. There's no story, no satisfying combat, no genuine attempts at comedy (seriously it's almost exclusively the ""panzu"" jokes""), no good characters, and overall just nothing positive going for it aside from the animation.

"I truly enjoyed this anime. The story itself was good enough that I didn’t necessarily need to have any prior knowledge that it takes place in Bleach universe. Although with only 3 episodes, the story sets itself up with the potential that it could later turn into a full 12 episode series. The artwork was amazing. When I think dragons, I think cute or total badass. Burn the Witch managed to deliver both. The fighting sequence was well done and didn’t feel dull. The main characters were enjoyable with the classic fiery witch being paired with the more calm demeanor one. Voice acting was on point.

As reviews need to be longer, just a few more words: There being a law that those who have touched dragons are to be imprisoned/executed sounds completely unreasonable. But, this could lead to further reveals, and I wouldn't mind just assuming it as a premise. The greatest part of the short story for me: in the end the problem isn't solved by friendship and love between human and dragons. That the white dragon outright tried to kill its adoptive mother lays promising grounds for further dragon-human relationships.",8,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_4deb74cb0b,1
"Burn the Witch was a pleasant surprise to me. It appeared really bland and mediocre on paper. Moreover, I have never read even a single chapter of Bleach, forget about being a fan of it. But still, the movie did a pretty decent job at entertaining me within its span of an hour. I'll explain why. Burn the Witch takes place in the city of London. It mainly revolves around two witches, Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, who are a part of an organization named Wing Bind. Their job is to protect and cope with dragons that are invisible to most people and cause the majority of the deaths in London. Needless to say, the premise of Burn the Witch isn't very unique. However, as I have always said, the story doesn't need to be completely unique in order to be compelling. If executed properly, even shows with the most unoriginal plots can be very entertaining to watch. Initially, Burn the Witch seems to follow that formula pretty well. Though, the problem with the plot becomes apparent as we move onto the second episode. Burn the Witch can be a bit overambitious at times. It tries to tell way too much story than it actually needs to. It wants to narrate a lot bigger story, but fails at doing so because of its short span. If the movie had run for 30 extra minutes, it could've done a much better job at world building and storytelling. But that isn't to say the plot is completely irredeemable. Despite not being particularly innovative or outstanding, it does a decent job at keeping the viewers engrossed in watching. But as I said before, just taking a little more time with the world building and storytelling could've been really efficient in making the plot even more enjoyable. Because of that exact reason, most characters don't get the chance to be fully fleshed out either. Not enough time is given to properly develop all of them, which can become a little problematic later on. They aren't unlikeable in any way, though. They all have their distinct and likeable characteristics which make them pretty entertaining. Our protagonists, Noel and Nana, are really likeable and their interactions are always amusing to watch. The backstory of Macy and Elly is also presented decently. Even Bruno, who seemed like a huge asshole, turned out to be a not-so-bad person in the end. I especially enjoyed Balgo's personality; his idiotic nature and uselessness might annoy some viewers, but I personally found it very appealing. In case of animation, Burn the Witch does a pretty decent job. Studio Colorido isn't the most renowned studio out there, but they handled the animation greatly in this case. The character designs are distinct and attractive. The dragons are decorated nicely in terms of designs as well. While some action scenes feel kinda stiff, most of them are very decently animated. The voice acting and soundtrack are also very decent. Most background tracks, despite not being very memorable, are befitting to the movie, which makes the fight scenes more dynamic and enjoyable. There isn't any opening theme, but the ending song ""Blowing"" sung by NiL is kinda catchy. To summarize, Burn the Witch is a pretty enjoyable movie. A little more runtime could've helped fix some of the issues regarding the narrative, but the movie was quite good for what it was. So if you are looking for a short but entertaining movie full of epic action and goofy characters, give Burn the Witch a try.",7,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_4904f3675a,1
"Cons: This three episodes transition and pacing isn't good, the way the episodes end aren't well done. It feels like they just wanted to squeeze some artwork with a catchy song at the end. The world building wasn't that good but not terrible, you could understand in a way what the world is in a few minutes. The main characters aren't bad, they're good characters. The supporting characters are just there, they could've played a better role in the story (specially Banx). Balgo is just annoying and useless. Pros: The world has an interesting setting Good artwork and sound Likeable main characters It's an enjoyable watch The pacing isn't that bad Overall: This one-shot has the potential to become a good anime, just fixing the pacing problem might be enough sense that's the main problem. It has a good setting, with supporting characters that can be great if they are done right, with two main characters that might become popular, sense there personalities are quite good.",7,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e047fb5fd3,2
"Burn The Witch is a average movie. The 3 episode format led to a unnecessary ending for two episodes when it should have just been put all together for fluidity. Story was nothing special but nothing trash. Plot twists were cool but generic. Characters were extremely average to me but Noel and Ninny got thighs so thats a plus. The interactions between the two main females are funny, sometimes. Animation once again is average and non-memorable. In conclusion, if you have a rough 1 hour of time to do anything, watch Burn The Witch if you just wanna pass time, but do not expect anything amazing.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_812eb3f85f,2
"Don't be mistaken: This is just a prologue. The movie adapts ""Season One"" of the Burn the Witch manga... which is only 4 chapters, with a Season Two confirmed to come at some point in the future. If you're familiar with Tite Kubo of Bleach fame, you will be able to tell that he plans on expanding this series way beyond this first movie. Story: 5/10. There are two things you need to know before jumping into this movie. The first: it's a sequel to the original Burn the Witch one-shot. Yes, not an adaptation, a sequel. The events of the one-shot still happened, but you don't get to see any of it. This is why you're just thrown into the series' world, without any real introduction to its main characters. The second: the story is incomplete. As I mentioned above, this movie, as well as the first season of the manga that it adapts, is a prologue. It serves to introduce you to Ninny, Noel, Balgo and a few other characters before the ""real story"" actually begins... Which is very weird, considering that the manga went into indefinite hiatus as soon as Season One was done, so we actually don't have that ""real story"" yet. Let's talk about the movie's story, for what it's worth. Two girls work for an agency that handles dragons, both friendly and useful, as well as aggressive and dangerous. They're currently taking care of this really annoying guy called Balgo, and if you want to know why... you have to read the one-shot. This is bad story-telling. Nothing indicates that the movie is a sequel to the one-shot, and you'll only find out about this if you do research on the series on your own, because there is NOTHING that alludes to why or how they got stuck with Balgo, which raises a lot of questions and confuses the viewer when they start throwing around terms that are explained in the one-shot... but not in the movie. You shouldn't have to do homework in order to understand the basic premise and world of your movie. Looking over this HUGE flaw, the story is... ok. Nothing special, for a prologue. It's meant to introduce you to the characters and establish the world and it does that fine enough, even if a bit clunky sometimes. Art: 8/10. It's Kubo. The man who achieved ""Big Three"" status on drawing cool shit alone. The character designs are great, which has always been his strong point, and the animation by Studio Colorido is fluid and pleasing to look at. There is a lot of flying around in this, as you'd expect from a show about witches, and it's all pretty well done. Spells look a bit boring for the most part, with the exception being the spells cast by Bruno, which are very creative in how they're cast and look different enough from the rest, which are basically just light being shaped differently. Yeah it's all a bit samey but it's not what I'd describe as bad, at all. Sound: 6/10. The voice acting is good, everyone fits their character and helps the movie sell you on who these people are. The background music was fine, if a bit unremarkable. The same could be said about the ending song, it did its job fine enough, but it's not like it's particularly memorable or something that I'd add to my anisong playlist, for example. Character: 7/10. Kubo knows how to write likable characters, even if he doesn't really know what to do with them as the series goes on. He also knows how to write insufferable characters. Case in-point: Balgo. Balgo is by far the worst thing about this series. Comic-relief characters are hard to write, I know that, and if you're not careful enough, you end up with a character like Balgo, a complete useless tag-along whose only role in the movie is to ""be funny"". I did not find him funny, I found him incredibly irritating. Everyone else is good, for what little we've seen of them. The two main characters are your typical energetic-apathetic dynamic, but what I like about them is that neither one of them is your typical hero(ine). They're both selfish, Noel is greedy and Ninny is ambitious to a fault, disregarding rules and even the safety of London citizens to prove herself worthy of a promotion. Their dynamic is nothing new but it was enough for me to want to see more of them. Other relevant characters include hot-headed, over-confident Bruno Bangnyfe, which is my favorite character thanks to a combination of great character design, cool powers and scene-stealing personality which is a Kubo classic; Macy Baljure, whose only real role in the prologue is to be cute and naive which I assume is to establish that she's going to be changing a lot throughout the series (whenever that decides to start); and Ninny and Noel's boss Billy Binx, Jr., a laid-back and lazy character who is pretty charming considering his small screen-time. The movie also introduces the Top of Horns, the rulers of the Wing Bind association, but their appearance is very brief, only serving to, again, assure the viewers that the story is only at its beginning. Honestly I would give it an 8/10 if Balgo wasn't so damn annoying. Enjoyment: 7/10. It's fun. That's all I can really say about this series so far, really. It did get me interested in seeing the rest of the story, which I guess was the purpose of the movie. It feels incomplete because well... it is. In a way this movie is just a big advertisement for Burn the Witch Season 2, whenever that decides to show its face on Weekly Shonen Jump. On its own, I'd give it a light 7/10.",7,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_506fc0782f,2
"I am going to start with the positives first. The animation is amazing, to the point that I feel bad the it going to be associated with this show's everything else. Also, it had some interesting worldbuilding ideas but it didn't explore that nearly enough. Ok that's the positives, now the negatives. The story feels both rushed and stalled at all times, I'm not even sure how that's possible. Things will just happen as if it was an already established, meaning there is little no explanation why things happen, but then there will be a 10 minutes of talking about nothing with characters we never met. This entire show feels as if you started a long-running Shonen on episode 50, which just so happened to be halfway into the arc where they introduce the over-arcing villain of the story. It just tries to gaslight the viewer into believing that the characters and the world have already been set up and that there was an actual story being told. I had to check many times to see if this was a sequel or prequel or a part of a franchise or that there was some thing that tied everything together, but no there wasn't.

"It probably should be more of an 8 rather than 9 but seeing this many nagging reviews... This piece has HUGE potential. In those few episodes it manages to show the universe (like scanning codes to open portals, using phones to keep track of their progress, those areas being locked by hidden fences) a plethora or characters (that don't look or act alike), great art (with plenty of detail and without those dumb underwear shots), good music (though unfortunately rarely played), a few twists (like that fingershot at the end) and jokes, everything being mixed in overall dark (or just far from fairytale) mood. Plot overall wasn't the best but... how can all this be squeezed in 60 minutes and reasonably development? Obviously it was rushed but characters are not irritably stupid, act naturally, dialogues and situations are well above good and I wish it would not have ended so abruptly, though they just had in order to have certain closure (unlike many others) and that just ears them more respect points.

I definitely hope, despite how unlikely it is, that this will be developed into a full fledged series, because the potential is amazing. The animation is smooth and super high quality, the choreography is amazing, and the visuals are just very pleasant and engaging. I found the two main characters very interesting, personally. Ninny is an automatic fave from me. The world building is pretty neat! Not entirely original but vague enough to be expanded on and twisted into something new. The concept of Front and Shadow London is pretty cool! I kind of want to know more about how that works! The world building and overall plot would be phenomenal for a longer show, and I really would love to have more. Like... what are the repercussions of traveling between the two? Do some of the characters have split lives based in each world, what is that like? I think this is so cool! Also, I just love dragons and girls being badass so... I'm all here for this!

"It's always upsetting to see such a good-looking show end up being all form over substance. Unfortunately, things such as stellar animation, beautiful colours, interesting looking art style, and cool character designs can't carry the overall chaotic direction and extremely rushed, poorly written plot. ""Burn the Witch"" offers a very nice and intriguing setting that serves as mere background to a story that's just half-baked. Half-baked, because how would one call a situation when viewers are supposed to care about anything and anyone, when all they learn throughout the show is that ""this place exists, this person exists as well""? Why do viewers have to learn about presumably important and strong secondary characters, see them saying a phrase or two, and afterwards not hear anymore about most of them, or just see them being somewhere in the background and saying something cryptic that's also not elaborated upon later on? Many high schoolers would write a better scenario, even for such a short animated series. It's even worse if we consider that without knowing the prequel movie, which was released 3 years (!) after the reviewed series, the viewers will have a hard time figuring out what the heck is exactly happening in the story, why do some situations occur, and why do certain characters act like they do. Yup, ""Burn the Witch"" doesn't offer any introduction, not without watching the ""Burn the Witch #0.8"" prequel movie. Speaking about its length, there are three episodes, and each one is 20 minutes long. In theory, that would be alright to tell a cute story. That is, if the writing was at least on an acceptable level. Sadly, like I mentioned earlier, the writing was mediocre at best, but most of the time it was chaotic and messy. The direction was weird as well, as if the show couldn't find balance between more static and more dynamic scenes, but preferred to just mix them up and end up with a rather convoluted mess. Some might say that it was like this in the source material. Some might say that this show fits the ""Bleach"" universe in which it is set. I'm neither familiar with the first nor the second thing, so as an anime only viewer, I can't relate to any of them. However, even if I had knowledge about one thing or another, I wouldn't treat it as something positive. If an anime is not labelled as a spin-off series, then it's not unwise to assume that one may enjoy the story without knowing the main series, no? Obviously, a shared universe is not the same as a shared story, after all. And at the end of the day, we're talking about an animated show that is loosely related to an already existing series. The fact that source material was worse or better, or that some elements might make more sense if someone is familiar with said existing series, shouldn't matter, in my opinion. I was torn between choosing ""Mixed Feelings"" or ""Negative"" as the final verdict for this review. I think the former will be more appropriate. I don't regret watching it myself. It didn't take a lot to watch the reviewed show and the aforementioned prequel movie, after all. Although, I can't recommend this show if you care about anything else than its great-looking visuals. Not with all the cons this show has, which I pointed out earlier.",4,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 9, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_531c7a3724,2
"That's a nice movie to watch, don't expect a masterpiece from a hour movie, but you won't regret spend that time on this title, I wish that title will get a tv shows seasons in the future cause it definitely deserves it. First of all the movie take place in the same universe as Bleach but it's in London and as y'all seen in trailer it's different than a well known Bleach world. It also bring a little bit of nostalgia, especially that characters gives you a 100% vibes of Tite Kubo drawing style and not gonna lie Bruno Bangnyfe give Grimmjow vibes unfortunately these characters don't share the voice actor. Story: It's good, but too rushed, alot of people will disagree with my point of view, but let's be honest you don't need to know everythign about a world to enjoy the movie and that's what happens here, a short plot with introducing a little bit of the world, of the main characters and with few actions. Art: I really like the art style of Tite Kubo which is visible in this movie and I love that fact, also i want to point out something which some people like some doesn't it's the specific art of background which in my opinion is familiar to Owari no Seraph background art, for me it was great the whole Reverse London looked incredible. Sound: Well that's a too short movie to even notice anything, the sound effect during actions is quite good, there is only one soundtrack which I memorised from that movie which is the main theme of burn the witch and that's all what I can say about that, unfortunately I didn't like that much of voice acting for Bruno. Character: They are unique but not unique at the same time, the art style and their look like is something which will make you remember these characters but their personalities is something which you can definitely find in another titles and it makes you forget about the character, the example is that Noel for me is like a female version of Ishida from Bleach and as I said before Bruno is similar to Grimmjow, but to be honest I like very much his balaclava, clothing for mouth i don't know how to properly call it in english. Enjoyment: That's a short and good movie to watch in an evening, to eat some pop-corn, chips or some other snaccs and just chill out while watching it, without thinking about what's gonna happen, who is who, who will do what, who will survive, etc. Just a simple story for a chilling which I personally like. Overall : 8/10 I really hope that burn the witch manga will have more opportunities for develop and will not have to be rushed like Bleach to give time for Kubo to make and procces this title for a better score, I hope that I will oneday be watching week by week episodes of Burn the Witch if that's gonna happen, I will be positive that it will happen, when?

Since there is so little of it I don't think there is much for me to dislike in it really, the one nitpick I would say is Balgo's subs voice is a little too whiny for my liking.

"Up until this point, Bleach had always had bad luck at adapting anything outside of its main TV series, the movies, the specials, everything just had to suck one way or the other, so when I heard of Burn The Witch, Kubo Tite's new One-Shot getting an animation short series, I had my doubts, and so, I help on the hype, I gave it time, and only decide to watch it recently, maybe, anything I was fearing would not come to pass. And man, did Kubo ever slapped me this hard since the early days of Bleach. Story (7.5/10): I'm only going for what I saw on these three episodes, because had it been a tad longer and more things were explore, this would have been an easy 8 if not more. These three episodes felt like the Romance Dawn arc of One Piece, it's super short, it has the spirit, but does not tell everything, no, no way near half of everything. You feel like setting the stone into a grand world build on top of Bleach's, but which entirely new and more expressive lore that followed everything thing. This felt like if Ghibli Studio were to animate a series instead of a movie more than not. Art (9.2/10): Close to perfection. The art style is there, the color palette, also there, the animation is dynamic and fluid, and the cinematography and camera angles were not of an average Anime screening. This was the best any of Kubo Tite's animate characters looked, and I hope it's a ten that will follow with the 1000 years blood arc of Bleach, Inshallah. The characters felt really, really fresh and new, but also very familiar and nostalgic, I guess Kubo is one of the few Mangaka that persists his signature art even as he improves it. Also, more of a reminder that Kubo really did miss a promising future as a fashion designer because the clothing and customs here are a moo of their own. Sound (8.3/10): I did not notice anything out of place, audibly speaking, the voice acting was sharp and great, the emotions were delivered, the passive-aggressive commentary was there and hit the comedic effect they aimed at, such a shame that no opening song came with this, but the ending was a great pleasurable treat. The OSTs were good and felt organic and part of the scenes, however, not quite on Bleach's level, to say the least. Characters (8/10): Obviously, we saw no character development “that mattered” in these three episodes, but it's fine as the start of the story is yet to unfold. The cast however is very varying and alive, with different characters with different interactions and charisma, never a dull moment of a boring conversation. The main duo, Noelle and Nina was just the right nail to seal this story, both great in opposing ways, which keeps it interesting and fresh, with countless of Shounen that features males as the primary main characters, it's about time we saw things differently from a protagonistic female ^point of view. Enjoyment (10/10): Three episodes were never going to be enough for this great showing. I certainly I not feel like I was gonna enjoy this this much, but I'm glad I did. Overall (8.6/10): That I better than was anticipating. Kudos to Kubo sensei for this new work, and looking forward to featuring sequels.

"Burn the Witch (2020) Whilst this was released as 3 episodes and not a movie and it would be a fairly short movie over the average I must say it was actually unexpectedly good. Whilst some of it can seem crude it actually does most of what it wants to right. The story has got a few pacing issues and would have made more sense being 3 episodes as part of a larger season but then its from a one-shot manga. It is a shame because the premise of the show is really interesting. The art although it can be a bit crude is perfectly good for the show. The majority of the art is a very high standard and what I love so much is the facial expressions when such things as Star Ash get near their faces. It is hilarious and so well thought out. The soundtrack generally is excellent and the SFX it produces was also excellent. Characters develop in as much as you learn who they are as much as you can in 3 episodes without derailing the story. The two main girls Noel and Ninny are really well thought out characters. Overall, It is definitely worth a watch. Is it a shame it probably won't ever come back?

"Is it worth watching? probably yes but get ready for some unnecessary mentions of pantsu and a dumb, blond, annoying dude. The setting looks amazing, the story looks interesting, the characters are a bit cliché and the fanservice is cringe. The setting is the city of london, cool place especially considering that for obvious reasons most anime don't have europeans settings, in this case London is a magical city sort of, the world has weird and well designed dragons and they are up to no good or atleast some of them. With all these creatures and magic there had to be, as the title says, witches and they are divided in different groups sorted by their tasks. Watching the prequel makes the story better since there is 1 character that looks a bit odd in the story but if you watched the prequel it should all make sense, anyway this anime made me so upset that i had to write my first review. It looks like someone took a perfect recipe and then chose to buy expired ingredients to make it. The story is very dynamic it starts right in the middle of some action losing little to no time explaining the backgroud of the world which is fine in this case, it makes everything really engaging and it allows the spectator to learn about the backstory in a less stagnant way. The main characters are fun and boring at the same time, you have Noel and Ninny that have very different personalities and they of course get on eachother nerves from time to time. Then you have Billy the chief of these 2 little witches, he's the typical character that looks like he's almost lost in his own world just to then realize he is smart and all and was just playing the part. At this point you get Balgo a character that has a flat personality he literally doesnt seem to be able to think like a normal human being, as dumb as a rock and cringe, his main goal in life is watching some ""pantsu"" same goes for his stupid dog that keeps repeating this deside of its owner. I just started watching this anime and i haven't read anything yet so i don't know where the story is going to go but the feeling that you get once Balgo gets on screeen is enough to turn your TV off even though everything else is amazing. This really looks like a missed opportunity, could have been such a cool anime and story but as far as i've watched it doesn't seem to become anything above the usual anime that you'd watch when you are bored but nothing more especially thanks to the fact that it looks like it's written for a 13yo with all this pantsu here and pantsu there.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 14, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_a74ef1ea5d,2
"A fun introduction to a cool concept (that turned out later on to be something a little more), 'Burn The Witch' is simple but generally effective. It doesn't explain a huge amount about it's world (even burying the lead of what world it even is until the end), but trickles the details through well enough that I don't consider most of it confusing. There's perhaps a couple of details I'd have preferred them to be a bit more upfront about, like what the seemingly separate divisions of Wing Bind actually do, but those things don't get in the way too much. And many of the other things that are left vaguer, such as just what a Dragonclad actually is, feel more deliberate than careless; after all, with more manga on the way, there's plenty of time to open the world up more. The characters don't get time to get deep development yet, but Ninny and Noel are an enjoyable enough pairing, with a decent energy around them, and the supporting cast in the status quo the ending establishes should be enough to build a story around going forward. The story of the film itself is a strong enough pilot. Certainly, it's not especially complex, but it throws in a couple of surprising enough beats, and does its job of introducing the world and characters perfectly adequately. The animation is strong, with a fun, slightly rough art style that I really like. Overall, a solid adaptation of the manga, and a promising start to something that will hopefully get a lot more time to flesh itself out.",7,Recommended,"May 4, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_ffc99b66d1,2
"Coming from Tite Kubo, the same author as Bleach, is Burn the Witch. Although not the most impressive start to a series i’ve seen, Burn the Witch is simply charming. From its clean animation and fantastical world to its badass designs and stupid humor, it had me entertained from beginning to end. I really only have two criticisms and first would be that it needs more source material to work with. Many characters come off as pretty flat, uninspired, and maybe even annoying in the case of Balgo. My second complaint would be one that even plagued Bleach. As story-beats fly by, it becomes apparent that the world and its mechanics need more time to be fleshed out and explained. Everything in the world just happens without any real explanation, and only becomes more confusing when remembered that BTW and Bleach somehow take place in the same world. This only leads me to one final conclusion, and that is we need more Burn The Witch. You should definitely watch this if you haven’t already watched it. It is one of last year’s best animes and is only 3 episodes long.",7,Recommended,"Jan 12, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_20a669c51b,2
"Spoiler free review: After seeing so many other negative reviews, i'm just gonna say this: THE STORY MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE IF YOU READ THE ONE-SHOT MANGA CHAPTER FIRST!!! It's just 60 pages or so, and it's totally worth it. While I wouldn't say it's required viewing/reading, the story WILL flow significantly better having read the chapter. After all, the ""movie"" adapts chapters 1 - 4 in the manga, and those all occur after the original one-shot. It helps to flesh out the characters with proper, longer introductions, including Balgo Parks, such as explaining how he obtained his ""abilities"" and Noel's relations with him. Now, finally, all of that aside, what do I actually think of the ""movie""? It was great! Obviously it wasn't flawless, and it could've used maybe another ""episode"" to flesh out the greater details (maybe adapt a little of the one-shot chapter, though that may take more than an entire ""episode""); however, in terms of adapting what they set out to adapt. they did a great job. The scenes in the manga were definitely enhanced with the music and beautiful animation. Many scenes were conveyed better to me in the animation than the manga, and the amazing dynamic ""camera angles"" really sold the fights. The voice acting is great, the story is quite decent (though the start may seem off-putting without having read the one-shot), and although it doesn't get quite enough time to flesh out the characters, they do have their own unique personalities (Osushi is the cutest thing ever, change my mind). Overall, I give Burn the Witch an 8/10. A solid experience, but please, for the love of anime, and for the thousandth time, READ THE ONE-SHOT FIRST!!!",8,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_7e036b59ef,2
"I honestly think this was a pretty cool 3 episodes and I would GLADLY watch an entire anime based on this that continued this story. Also, I think that one thing people get wrong about this one-shot is that it's meant to be like a base of sorts, one guy explained it well saying it's like a pilot episode for a series. A pretty good story that would make a great anime and the story introduced could be grown upon greatly! The art was pretty great, though I can't say much cause of spoilers Sound also great, fit the scenes pretty well IMO Characters were for the most part interesting, though one thing that people keep bringing up is how flat they are and no development, but seriously guys, it's 3 episodes.

"To best summarize how I feel, it's a nice watch but it just feels too short and incomplete. It's as almost they were planning a season for the anime and then realized they only had a budget for three episodes. So the ""movie"" is three episodes of ~20 minutes or about an hour long. That's not a lot of time to make a complete and satisfactory story. There needs to be time to set up the plot, get some background and a foundation for the story, create characters and explain their quirks and relationships, etc... There just isn't enough time for that in an hour movie... Even worse, it feels like the movie drops you right into episode 6 of a season (of 13 episodes). Two minutes of a backstory isn't enough to fully nurture a good story. Even worse it tries to get to the last episode of season if the span of time equal to three episodes... which is a bit too rushed. There isn't any real growth in the characters... and characters show up but they just don't have any major importance to the movie at all. That aside, what I watched... I enjoyed. It was a fun watch and I see potential for anime series that could work and I would be down to watch that if that were the case. There needs to be more time to explain things and not to have them throw everything to the viewers in just one hour. This could have worked as a movie.. but in the end it just turned out three episodes that were treated as a movie which just doesn't work out that well. Perhaps the creators didn't have a choice in that manner... which is a shame because I do see some positives in Burn the Witch.",7,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_7c6c2355e3,2
"I've never read or seen much of Bleach, but I'm certain that this show has nothing to do with the plot of it other than being in the same universe, and is perfectly enjoyable without the knowledge of Bleach. What appealed to me when scouting for something, anything to watch, was the character designs, which are pleasant enough to look at even when they're not moving. I was pleased to see that, in motion, the characters are detailed and distinct enough, as well as plenty expressive enough for me to enjoy my time watching the show even if I had the sound turned off and had no clue what was happening. I'm pretty confident you actually could watch these three episodes without any sound and interpret a general idea of what was happening anyways. That is the sign of a competently made animation is my opinion. Tite Kubo wrote the story as a one shot, and I think the concept is creative, the two central characters are at least entertaining to see interact with each other and the world around them. Ninny and Noel have distinct enough personalities and designs that fit well with Studio Colorido's interpretation of London. Kubo's character designs blend and move well with the environment thanks to the animation team's talent and, I assume, damn good budget, considering the only three episodes. The story felt to me somewhat interesting, but of course not really that impressive considering the length of the one shot. You have three episodes to decide if the characters are worth following, because really that's what drew me in and kept me watching, aside from the gratifying animation of course. If Kubo decides to expand on what he's created here, I insist he do so. I imagine he could do quite a lot given what he's already done, considering the cool magic system, entertaining characters, interesting setting, and of course a promising animation direction. Are these three episodes worth your time? I think so; there's a lot to appreciate here. And if the designs are to your liking, you'll probably get enough out of this show to feel satisfied when it's over, which will unfortunately be very quickly.",7,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e75653fa20,2

Yes, a world of free-roaming dragons being left unchecked is a problem. But burn the witch feel way too forced when it already has a believable base to it. That followed by a lack of explanation into the actual problem make the story a wild mess to watch that is only made bearable by some really amazing main and supporting cast.

"I thought Burn the Witch is an anime series. I never knew that it's a movie split into three episodes. Here are the high points. The world building is pretty neat with London being split into two dimensions--one of them being the magic realm. I like the way it treats its rules with nuance with the characters casually giving the audience information about how things work without looking like exposition. The magic in the story is also unique, somehow modernizing the witch motifs. The female leads are also fun to watch. The male major character is also charming and the other female character that showed up near the end is also interesting. Here are the not so high points. Burn the Witch forgot it's a movie and instead acted like the first three episodes of an ongoing anime series. Alongside its worldbuilding, it introduces new mysteries and conflicts that implies that you have to keep watching to figure them out but that won't happen because it's a movie. As a result, there's no clear narrative or conclusion. This weakness in the writing has dragged the story down significantly. That being said, the production value is pretty good. The animation and artwork is great with a pretty good OST. The character designs really pop. I never watched Bleach so it's only after the ending card and further research that I realized that this is set in the Bleach universe. Overall, Burn the Witch as a stand alone movie isn't the best. I hope there's a continuation because the story that's about to unfold has promise.",7,Recommended,"Dec 5, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_5781e3c236,3
"Burn The Witch, the newest piece of fiction related to the well known Bleach series by Tite Kubo, It's been awhile since I've written a review, so apologies if it's not the best written review. Story: The Story of Burn The Witch is an interesting one and very different from that of Bleach, in this case we're not talking Soul Reapers or Hollows, as this takes place in the London or rather Front London and Reverse London, and focuses on a pair of witches working for a organization called Wing Bind, who deal with dragons, and dragons cause roughly 72% of deaths in London are caused by dragons, Wing Bind will protect dragons if necessary even raising them, other times they have to kill dragons, but the story outside of that focuses Ninny and Noel, who have to do their job for Wing Bind but also protect Balgo a Dragonclad, as dragons are attracted to him due to being a Dragonclad. I give the story an 8 (Very Good), it's interesting and distinct from others. Art: The art and animation is really good in this anime and it nails down the art style of Tite Kubo, and that for me is enough to give it a 9 (Great). Sound: The sound is good, voice acting and music were good, but I can't say it was amazing or bad, as such a 7 (Good) for the sound. Character: The characters are interesting and largely do complement eachother Ninny is a driven character with her own goals with her job at Wind Bind, and being a celebrity infront london, Noel is a character who largely follows the book to some extent, but is willing to do two person jobs in order to get the rewards for herself. Balgo may be an annoying character to some, with his head over heels feelings for Noel, but he isn't super over the top and just avoids being that one annoying character that I hated. Other characters are given brief introductions, that give you a relative decent impression of what sort of characters they are, but you do not get bombarded with information about them, for example there are multiple characters who are high ranking members and you can fully guess the type of character they would be from their designs and the way they present themselves. For the characters I give it an 8 (Very Good). Enjoyment: This is something that is very much different to the other categories, as the enjoyment for each person that watches this anime will depend on not only the previous categories but also any prior knowledge and/or enjoyment of related works, I was very much a fan of Tite Kubo's Bleach and the Burn The Witch manga one shot and series so far as well as some of his other works, the fact that the characters are different from others in his other works, the fact the anime captures Tite Kubo's art style pretty well, it was truly a 10 (Outstanding) for me, but it may very well be anywhere from 1 to a 9 for others, but to me it was truly a 10. Overall: so overall the way I do these written reviews where I go through the different things like story, art, sound, etc. I will give an average score, so summary here's the scores > Story: 8 > Art: 9 > Sound: 7 > Character: 8 > Enjoyment: 10 > Overall: 8.4 I recommend it for general anime fans, any fans of magical/fantasy shows, but personally I would say if you're a fan of Bleach or any works by Tite Kubo, this is a must watch.",8,Recommended,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0e4ac3ab86,3

Have the right expectations going in; good art check, good music and sound check, good shonen level enjoyment check, good story no (hopefully its coming in the future).

So there is not much to say about the series due to the fact that it consists of 3 episodes .It's not even close to its end ,but I have to say that I'm really intrigued in it. There was something really beautiful about the artstyle in these episodes ,especially the way the enviroment around the characters is drawn.The animation was pretty cool too. Well we still have very little info about the plot ,but it really seems to have the potential to become pretty good. The characters are pretty likeable and fun to watch,unlike a large amount of new anime/manga casts that tend to make me feel like ''ah I really don't care about these guys'' I would recommend it ,it's pretty promising and a really enjoyable small pack of episodes",7,Recommended,"Jun 17, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_35c6704b84,3
"The good: The animation is excellent and the super stylized character design is typical of Tite kubo which is excellent if you love the art of bleach, the world and premise are imaginative, the action scenes are entertaining. The bad: the story moves very fast, it does not let you familiarize with the environment and characters, although you cannot expect much from a 50-minute movie, just don't expect a deep story and three-dimensional characters. In conclusion: Its a fun and ejoyable movie/miniseries but as i stated before the story moves at flash speed and there are so many elements not explained or expanded on, I hope and one day the creators will make a complete and proper anime series and take their time to expand on their world and how it works as well as the characters and their past, the lore of this anime have so much potential and dont want to watch it being wasted just in this movie.

"I have to say I very mush enjoyed watching this. While not finding anything very thrilling to watch this season, this was really refreshing! Something about the mood and the tone that was set in the very beginning really hooked me and urged me to keep watching. The animation and the fights was very clean. I loved the team work and fight moves the girls had together. The character dynamic between the main girls is great. It create a good balance. Now what I did not like. It felt very rushed. I had just meant the character and next time I know they where fighting the main boss? I wish it did a bit more world building and explain things more. If this ""movie"" has J.K Rolling style world building the would be top tier 10/10. Maybe if the had more eps/ movie time?? A bigger budget? source material I don’t know ? It left me with two many un answered question. What are they flying on dragons? Why are there's so small ? Who is their boss? What association are involved. Whats up with the sword? Also the one thing I hate is when they skip part of the story and flash forward like nothing happened. It really reduced the impact of the big boss fight.

"This anime was released this season in 2020 and was supposed to be an anime film, but for one reason or the other, the producers ended up making this a short three episode series. Because of the length, however, some negative aspects really seemed to stand out. But, before that, the positive. The animation was very clean, especially when a good chunk of the series had the two witches flying around, evading enemies or buildings in a stylish way. The character designs were also very well done, especially when it came to non-human aspects such as the dragons. The action scenes were not overly dramatic but they certainly had their own charm and made you excited for the battle itself. Some things, however, did not go as smoothly. The characters themselves were a little too on the nose. I understand that this was only three episodes, but they only really stuck to one generic characteristic. For now, there was not a lot of depth into their characters or personalities. This was based on a manga of the same name in 2018, which has since announced that there will be a second season of the manga. Because of this, and the relative success of the anime adaptation, it is very likely that there will be a legitimate season, not a three episode/film sort of thing. Lastly, this may be a slight spoiler so be warned. This is officially set inside of the popular Shonen Jump anime Bleach universe. This can be realized at the end of the third episode where a sign is established over the company labeled “Western Branch of Soul Society”. With a new season of Bleach coming at us sometime in 2021, Burn the Witch certainly could be involved in one way or the other, something many fans are now excited about. But, all in all, I did enjoy this anime. I certainly do not regret it, especially since it was only three episodes. If you are looking for something new to lightly binge, here you go!

Despite being very impresive for 3 episode Anime, this movie does'nt feel solid. The visualis good, the sound design is also good, the characther is fine, but the story is that makes this movie does'nt solid at all (at least what i feel when i watch it from non-manga reader perspective). We got a little naration for what happened here and the world of this anime, but that is nothing more. And the story is like in the middle of the series it self (we have nothing know to start the series and the ending just cliffhanger). I think the purpose of this Movie is just to show what the studio can do, and what would be like if Burn the witch is adapted to anime.

I feel like Kubo really wanted to go in a younger more colorful direction in contrast with the edgy and angsty style of Bleach and he has done that very well. This being set in the Bleach universe also brings up a lot of questions regarding what dragons are. Since they are basically a version of hollow, what would dragons be? Hollows come from the souls of humans while dragons seem to breed and hatch from eggs. How does the power system work? Could the Chief beat Goku? I came out of this with more questions than answers.

Keep along with ""Noel & Ninni,"" the well-known kouhai/senpai team in WB (Wing Bind), as they cope with a misfortunate pervert who can't seem to quit attracting these lethal beasts. You won't find the most brilliantly written characters or the most compelling world-building in this fantasy tale. The anime has an introduction and all the necessary elements to begin a plot, but by the time it's over, it feels like you've simply watched a bunch of episodes from the middle of a previously aired show. With the exception of that hint at the end, I'm not sure whether this has any significant connections to Bleach, but this ONA stands on its own. Even if it lacks a complete plot, the anime has the potential to be an even more enjoyable journey. The anime's aesthetic department is unquestionably its most outstanding feature. The visuals alone are worth a watch, thanks to the appealing character designs, vibrant animation, and frequently spectacular camera movement during its action scenes. Additionally, the campy credits song is a nice way to conclude each episode, except it's not really essential. The fact that this collection of ONAs is a collection rather than a film makes it one of the biggest issues with it. It turns out that it was a movie originally only released in Japan as a one-hour film. Crunchyroll, however, had the strange idea to split the movie into three parts, which not only destroys the flow of the story but also creates a needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. They had to cut out a chapter from the source material (that chapter 0 gives a backstory as to why Balgo needs special attention, aka why he's necessary to the plot). Even though the emotional plot it builds for its characters doesn't reach its utmost height, considering the timeframe, the creators did a respectable job of getting their message out loud and clear with two female protagonists carrying the show with their charm. However, there are a few pointless kinks that can cause some people to avert their gaze. Who should watch this? Unless you're finding for something complete, I see no reason to not watch this ONA.

In short, it's Tite Kubo again, you can tell by the character models, with one of the main heroines looking like a more mature (not just in one particular body part) and taller Rukie, and the other heroine being a bit of a copy of Hijori, with a short-haired and taller Orihime, actually Marcy here, and I could go on and on like this.... What's worse is the fact that the Ichigo here, well so does Balgo, so far seems like a much more annoying and stupid character - I know at least one person who wouldn't believe that's possible... Anyway, I've seen a brief introduction to an interesting world, it's like Bleach meets the Dragon Hunter and occasionally even borrows a bit from Harry Potter, which I really like and obviously has a lot of rules and weird stuff to offer. Even animation-wise it was quite distinctive, Studio Colorido did a decent job - visually I was intrigued. I could find a few quibbles with the characters, like I've already written about Balgo, but overall I'm interested in them.

As this three part anime series opens we are told that most disappearances in London are due to dragons. Most of the inhabitants can't see them though. There is also a second City of London; Reverse London. Here people are aware of the dragons and they are controlled by 'Wing Bind'. Protagonists Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole are two witches who work for Wing Bind to protect the city. I enjoyed this short series; it is just a pity it didn't have more episodes. The setting is good and the characters are fun to watch. The scenes of them battling against dragons were suitably exciting without being too scary for older children. The plot is simple enough but effective. The character designs aren't as polished as those in most series made these days but they had a distinctive look that I liked.

"So I came to this a bit later than most which led to me not realizing this anime/movie is part of the Bleach universe. No where on Crunchyroll's app did it inform me of this nor did it state as much in the beginning. The issue with this is that I have never watched Bleach and have no interest in doing so thus I have no context for the things happening or mentioned in Burn The Witch making it a very confusing a sometimes frustrating watch. Story: This is very difficult for me to rate. As someone who has not watched Bleach I would rate this as a 1 because it felt like I was entering an anime part way through since they barely explained anything important. I'm not sure what a fan of Bleach would rate this but I'm assuming it would be significantly higher. We're introduced to concepts and characters as if we should have some additional information outside what the movie gives us - it's frustrating to watch at times. Burn The Witch feels like the beginning of a longer anime, while at the same time feeling like an arc taking place part way through a longer anime. I can see them possibly making a season 2 after this but they failed with their first season in my opinion. The first season of an anime is supposed to be used to build the characters and world, and this movie did none of that. It gave us ""mysteries"" that we are supposed to care about for some reason, and they rush through an entire arc in an hour. It doesn't feel like a movie at all, and should have been longer so they could explain things better. Also a side annoyance: There's some really bad tonal whiplash when Macy and Balgo are involved in a scene. Art: The art is fine. Nothing special. Sound: Nothing amazing but I didn't hate any of the music or voice acting so it's whatever. Characters: I don't care about any of the characters in this anime. I feel no connection to them and they barely show any personality traits outside a single one. Noel is boring and generic. She's the typical serious half of a duo and has no interesting personality traits. Ninny is the opposite of Noel. Shocker. She's like... famous I guess? She's part of a band I think but it doesn't really delve into that at all even though one of the main antagonists is linked to a former member of her band who also becomes a semi-important character toward the end. Speaking of, Macy is both sad and annoying. Her backstory and personality really shine through during the little screen time she has but holy crap is she the cause of some tonal whiplash. One moment she's pouring her heart out to Ninny, the next second it goes full comedy with her throwing shit at Noel. It's terribly paced and feels very out of place. Tonal whiplash from Macy is nothing compared to Balgo though. Balgo has no good qualities at all. He's stupid, ignorant, weak, pathetic, perverted, and happy-go-lucky. He never takes anything seriously in a ""I have no idea what's going on even though I'm going to die"" kind of way that is not at all appealing. I don't mind flippant characters if they apathetic or cocky, but Balgo is neither of those. He's just really really stupid and situationally tone deaf. He has no redeeming qualities and the way Ninny treats him is the main reason Ninny is the best character in the anime. There's a handful of other characters but most are not important, and the few that are aren't very interesting or relevant. Besides Bruno probably. He's like the big bad for 5 minutes and then he joins forces with Ninny and Noel to take down Cinderella (who just so happened to be named Elly by Macy even though she had no idea she was actually Cinderella so... that was dumb). He's brash, egotistical, and cocky. He's fine I guess? Not a highlight though. Enjoyment: As a not fan of Bleach I didn't find this enjoyable at all. Some of the art design was neat, and the magic system seems interesting if strange (and not explained at all). Some interesting concepts that don't get any real screen time or explanations. It was only an hour so it wasn't worst, and I wouldn't call it boring so it was fine. Overall I'm not sure if I would recommend this anime or not. It has some interesting concepts but is sometimes confusing and annoying. Not great. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 20, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_c4f32a5962,3
"Teaser for the potential to come... So Burn the Witch's ""movie"" is another of Tite Kubo's manga adaptations brought into anime and for what these 3 episodes has shown us as a ""sneak peak"" as it were LA is VERY intrigued and a bit invested into this IP. Burn the Witch's premise has most of the hallmarks of Tite Kubo's writing but heightened in some ways but still lacking in details due to the screentime of this ""teaser movie"". Burn the Witch's premise is also interesting in which there are ""Reverse"" Worlds and in London, dragon roam, Pipers eliminate them all the while humans who come into contact with them get executed, though there are humans form the ""Real World"" can go into the Reverse World and harbor dragons being ""Dragonclad"" and they are used to ""bait"" other dragons. The characters are also interesting, from the aggressively tsun Ninny Sprangcole voiced by Asami Tano a former singer turned Piper along with her partner the stoic teasing Noel Niihashi voiced by Yuina Yamada and the bumbling aloof idiot Balgo Parks voiced by Shinba Tsuchiya who's a dragonclad and has a MASSIVE crush towards Noel. The first three episodes mainly centres on Balgo for the first episode, while the last two centres on Ninny due to the other character of Macy Baljure voiced by Saori Hayami who used to be in same idol band Ninny was in and she somehow ended up in Reverse London. Though on this front, Noel seemed to be the most reactionary in the cast let laone we not knowing much about her besides her being Ninny's partner. Though to counteract this, Burn the Witch's world building was MASSIVELY interesting from how the structure of the Reverse London handles it's dragon problem to the higher ups, something Tite Kubo is adept at in writing. The world building all within the three episodes though giving us exposition but needed nonetheless, fleshed out Reverse London and it's workings all the same and made LA invested into it much more easily at that too. The animation done by Studio Colorido was done extremely well, with Tite's style pretty much shown through it's character designs off the bat to the good to great battles shown. Really not much else to say besides that the animation OOZES Tite's style and flair and Studio Colorido captured that brilliantly. The voice cast was also pretty good with some relatively new seiyuu's like Yuina Yamada to Shinba Tsuchiya to some veteran and somewhat rookie seiyuu's like Saori Hayami and Asami Tano in the voice cast, nonetheless the voice cast was REALLY good from Saori Hayami's quick changing cadence to Yuina's more stoic-ness reminding LA of Saori Oonishi. If LA had to pin LA's favoruite seiyuu in this cast..........Asami Tano, with Yuina Yamada as a close second. Nonetheless decent to almost great voice cast. LA sees massive potential in Burn the Witch and in this regard kinda makes LA want to return back into Bleach in this regard and yes Bleach and Burn the Witch does have connection which is shown near the end of the 3rd episode and to this regard, though Burn the Witch's characterization is lacking as well as the first episode's ""incident"" glossed over for plot and screentime reasons kinda rushing things, LA could see that being fleshed out from the teaser we got here. If anything if Burn The Witch manages to actually get a full series off this, LA will and would actually watch it as this teaser pretty much cemented that fact that it's something to dig into and having all the potential it can to be something HUGE if it can be, but we'll more or less see if Burn the Witch actually gets a full anime series in due time. The ""teaser movie"" has tons of potential, let's just hope for the best as this might be Tite Kubo's peak writing but for the teaser movie itself it shows promise and LA was decently invested in it and liked it more or less.

"Fair warning-This is my first review. I went into this not realizing it was a ""movie,"" so I was definitely a bit bummed when I realized I wasn't getting any more episodes, haha. However, a season 2 has been announced for the manga, and I'm hoping that will get an anime adaptation eventually. Burn The Witch has an overflowing well of potential to tap into. It did a great job of setting up the world and characters and giving a reason to be invested in them. As a complete story on its own, it's definitely a bit lacking. I feel as though the time spent on the EDs would have been better spent wrapping everything up. Each episode feels like it isn't entirely resolved, at least not on-screen. Instead, it's wrapped up at the beginning of the next episode, which is fine, but it's not entirely satisfying. I wanted to see more of the resolution. It's a bit jarring to cut from a high-intensity scene at the end to the next day where everything is fine and low-stakes again. Perhaps a more traditional movie length and structure would have benefited this series. Still though, what we *do* have is very enjoyable and absolutely gorgeous. The character designs are simple and clean yet dynamic and striking; they convey a great deal of character while not being overly complex. The simple and clean artstyle compliments the animation greatly, which is fluid, dynamic, and very creative. This is most certainly a 'spectacle' anime. If nothing else, it is absolutely worth watching for the gorgeous animation and spectacular cinematography. I'm not really well-versed enough in cinematography to explain why it's so good, but everything just flows together really well, and it feels very exciting to watch. The characters also have great chemistry and bounce off each other very well. Sometimes, the characterization can feel a bit off and out of nowhere, but overall, it's very strong. The main two girls especially have very strong personalities that are a joy to watch, especially together. Overall, while this may not be a masterpiece, I found it throughly enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who might be considering watching it. It's not a big timesink by any means, so there's not much to lose if you end up not enjoying it after all.",8,Recommended,"Oct 11, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9be55b4f4a,3
"Burn the Witch is the definition of a cashgrab that relies purely on the fame of a previous work of its autor in order to sell and it otherwise offers nothing of value. It’s supposed to be some sort of spin off that takes place in the same setting as Bleach but it has absolutely nothing in common with it. I didn’t make a review of Bleach because there is no point in doing that, since everyone and their mothers already talked about it both positively and negatively, but I will make comparisons between the two. First thing to notice is how it takes place in a different country, nothing wrong in that, and it goes for a urban/contemporary fantasy and magic realism type of story, meaning the normal people is more or less aware of everything that happens (in one side), unlike in Bleach where neither the Hollows nor the Shinigami could be seen by people with weak spiritual energy…at first, something that changed completely later on. This would be pretty interesting if said normal people would get a role in the story but as of yet they don’t do nothing of importance, heck, they are not even allowed to interact with the monsters, which here are presented in different form than they had in Bleach, as dragons. Another thing where is weaker than Bleach is having a much lighthearted tone. Although Bleach has lots of silly comedic moments from beginning to end, the first episodes have a creepy atmosphere with a haunting soundtrack at times, something which was completely lost here. For something positive, the Soul Society here works completely different, it no longer follows a military logic with clear borders that separates the japanese elite from the poor and miserable foreigners (cough) but instead works as some kind of company where the Soul Reapers are some kind of employees that hunts the hollows in pairs for credits. Believe or not, this is a good thing, in Bleach, the Reapers sent on a mission could be a single soldier or both the captain and lieutenant of a squad which was kind of sily if you think about it. Why would you send a single person on a mission, or why would you do that with the two biggest authorities of a squad, leaving it behind without leadership and boy was the Gotei 13 lucky that they never received an attack at the same time. Also, I never understood why the captains have only one lieutenant and only one squad under their supervision. And the ranks were complete bullshit, with stronger people serving under weaker people at times. None of that nonsense is present here, as everyone has the chance to get a higher rank just by working a lot. Also, the Gotei 13 is presented much sooner and they already began moving in order to capture some sort of legendary weapons/creatures which are seemingly going to be important later on. What I didn’t like is how the place feels like a school, is there really a need to have a school in everything, especially if it involves magic? Anyways, the premise is more or less the same as in Bleach only less interesting because of the lack of a creepy atmosphere as I already said but also because the characters here are complete shit. The black haired girl is the only one who is completely serious about what she does and does not take bullshit from anyone, but she’s also so serious she’s just boring to watch. The blonde one is just Hiyori from the Vizards in steroids and man is she annoying. And still not as much as the guy, he’s so stupid, he ruins any attempt at seriousness. And there’s also a yandere type of antagonist who has a crush on the blonde girl and just like with the guy, I was expecting for the moment both of them die on screen, which obviously didn’t happen because they are going to be main characters later on. Another problem in the show is how the spells are totally boring, they are just light beams of different colors and that’s it, nothing like in Bleach where they had all sorts of shapes and functions and I need to point out how the characters keep pulling powers out of nowhere, in fact that is how the anime ends, leaving any sort of closure completely open for it is just a prologue which exists only to promote the manga. That is another issue it has, it’s too short and silly to make anything feel important, and on top of that, since it clearly wanted to promote the manga, it skipped the pilot chapter which shows how the main characters get together and are connected, none of that is present here, which could have worked as a bit of their backgrounds. It also feels uninspired, with the dragons flying around it just feels like you are watching something made by Hiro Mashima, and the two sides from the same city, which seem to work as some sort of parallel dimensions connected to each other (I’m only guessing, it’s never explained), is basically taken from Harry Potter, with the only difference being that the “muggles” know what happens here and can move from one side to another under certain circumstances. I like how the legendary weapons/creatures are based on classic fairy tales, I’ll give it that, but even then it’s nothing I hadn’t seen done already in Read or Die, in a much more creative and fun way. Ultimately, what everyone who watched this really cared for was the action and the visuals, and I have to admit that they are not bad, but when they are praised beyond the point they deserve, I have to point out how neither of these elements are that great either. By comparison, in the same season, Majo no Tabitabi and Akudama Drive came out and Burn the Witch just pails before them. And in the same year we got the likes of Tower of God, Deca-Dence and Fog Hill of Five Elements, all of which are also far better and more spectacular than this show in these aspects. Another thing that was praised about it are the character designs and I don’t understand why, Kubo knows how to draw his stuff but he also tends to repeat the faces of his characters a lot, in Burn the Witch, the black haired girl is basically a mix between Orihime and Bambietta from Bleach and as I said the blonde is an aged up Hiyori. The same thing can be said about every other character, they resemble the characters from Bleach a lot and the artwork lacking in details does not help them either. There is a character with a somewhat original design, but he has the same problem as Mirio from My Hero Academia, he resembles a famous character (Luigi) a lot and the chances of liking his design are gonna be divisive because of that. The special effects are not bad but for a show where they throw magic left and right, they could and arguably should be better, the best things in the visuals are the backgrounds, the city looks really good. The motions are fine but nothing really surprising, again I feel like they could have been better and at times they felt kinda sloppy. They feel consistently fluent and fast paced but it’s mostly because of the camera work, which follows every movement the girls make with and without their brooms. And as I said, Majo no Tabitabi did it better. I have nothing to say about the sound, the sound effects lack impact, the voice acting is one of the same you can hear everywhere, the music is alright but nothing really memorable. And that’s it, there isn’t really much else to comment about it, it’s short, it’s just a prologue, it’s mostly silly and nonsensical, poorly written, it has trashy characters, it feels disjoined from the series it’s supposed to be related to, it feels derivative in some elements, everything it does has been done before (for better or worse) and it’s not amazingly animated, it also had the bad luck of airing in 2020, the anti hype year, and thus it didn’t caused as much impact as expected, but I guess it served to remind the audience that Bleach will get a sequel soon, let’s see if this one still retains its audience and manages to sell once that adaptation of a somewhat hated arc is over.",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 24, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_d99b2e251d,4
"In an alternate universe, there exists a ""Reverse London"", a place where people can see the dragons but that alone isn't issue. Despite their enormous size compared to humans, dragons can still infect normal humans into becoming something inhumane. Keep along with ""Noel & Ninni,"" the well-known kouhai/senpai team in WB (Wing Bind), as they cope with a misfortunate pervert who can't seem to quit attracting these lethal beasts. ""Merits"" The anime's aesthetic department is unquestionably its most outstanding feature. The visuals alone make it worth to watch, thanks to the appealing character designs, vibrant animation, and frequently spectacular camera movement during its action scenes. You won't find the most brilliantly written characters or the most compelling world-building in this fantasy tale. The anime has an introduction and all the necessary elements to begin a plot, but by the time it's over, it feels like you've simply watched a bunch of episodes from the middle of a previously aired show. But the characters make it fun, atleast. Ninni and Noel are definitely the charm of the show. The tsundere senpai and the calm kouhei dynamic is a fun to watch and there is also an often-wonderful display of their relationship in some nice emotional moments. Balgo is only important for the sake of plot. He has little emotional depth which is overshadowed by his carefree lifestyle and perverse attitude towards Noel. Like, come on, ma boy. The world is filled with magic and dragons out there, and you are still going after a girl with big breasts. Macy is a bit emotionally unstable, and the anime takes some tonally different visual choices to express her issue, but a small-time limit and a forgettable backstory makes her hard to connect with. Bruno is cool, I guess. ""Downsides"" The fact that this collection of ONAs and isn't a film is one of the biggest issues with it. It turns out it originally was a film, only released in Japan as a one-hour film. Crunchyroll, however, had this strange idea to split the movie into three episodes, which creates this needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. But the ED, however, is still a very chill song to vibe with. ""Conclusion"" Short, to the point, and Fun. The ONA stands on its own. Unless you're finding for something 'complete', I see no reason to not watch this ONA. If you are in a busy schedule but got an hour to spare or are just bored and want something entertaining, this will be a fun little jaunt you would like to take.",7,Recommended,"Feb 25, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_079a48ef0d,4
"Burn the Witch is a mixed bag. The story itself is a 6/10, but it has many redeeming qualities that elevate it to a 7/10, such as the animation and some creative elements. There could be a good story here if it were a 24-episode season to further flesh it out. However, it ends just as things were getting interesting. There are hints of a larger and more interesting narrative/mystery but it is unfortunately limited by its short format.

You lose the prologue of how Balgo becomes a dragonclad and that's really it. What carried me through this ""movie"" was Noel. Waifu material, buckaroo. If you're trying to watch this to get Bleach nostalgia, then this will do it, the art style can easily be compared to that of Bleach and if you want comparison. Noel is like Rukia, Ninny is a female Renji, and Balgo is most similar to Kon.

"This anime is the best kind of ok. An ok that has fun and sometimes rises above mediocrity to deliver a fun, but forgettable experience. The story is by far the worst thing. It feels like walking into a movie at the end of act 1 and leaving said movie before the ending. The world meanwhile is really imaginative. Reverse London is an improvement in almost every way when compared to the Soul Society, from its rules to its looks. The characters are in some gray area of quality between the confusing story and the great world. The standouts are Ninny and Bruno. Their loud personality and great really made them pop out. But then you have Balgo and Macy, both underdeveloped and in the case of the former wasted as the horny comic relieve Writing-wise, this is decent, but far from the hights Bleach once reached. What this has that Bleach doesn't is budget. Kubo already designed some of the most appealing and expressive character designs, so seeing these designs moving fluidly is a treat for the eyes. The score is also really good. My favorite piece was the ending Nill, its melody and singing make you think that this will be an emotional and action packed modern fantasy and I hope it becomes that. When you watch Burn the Witch, remember that this isn't really a movie is more a pilot for a new IP. And as far as pilots go, this is not that bad.

"This movie seems to pretty much just be a commercial for the manga. For me that's not necessarily a bad thing, as I did enjoy most of what it had to offer. First of all I gotta say, this movie was way too short. A movie split into 3 anime length episodes was too little and is one of the biggest setbacks this film has. The story starts way to abruptly with minimal explanation and the overall story suffers because of this. There just isn't enough time to properly introduce the character's or pull you into the plot. While the story isn't anything too special, I did find myself liking some of the character's even if they were pretty shallow. Now for the art, animation and sound I have very little complaints. The character design is well done, something Kubo Tite never seems to fail on. The animation was smooth and well done. I only noticed the 3D animation being slightly jarring once at the start, other than that I can't say I even noticed it being used much. Other then that, the art style is clean and I loved the color palette. The sound was really good and varied. I found myself liking a lot of the background music and the ending song was decent as well. All in all this series has good potential and I hope Kubo Tite is able make something great out of this. The movie did suffer quite a bit from being so short, but I'm excited to see where this goes.

"You ever anticipate an upcoming show or movie expecting to be completely entertained? Well, this isn't that. It was merely OK. The background work was great. But the character art felt flat to me. It looks like a lot of the current style of computer animation that for the sake of production speed, they sketch out the characters with minimalized details and then use a paint bucket tool to fill in the color. A stark contrast to the beautifully detailed background work. The sound work was nicely done, no complaints there and the music blended in beautifully as well. The problem is with the overall story. It felt like taking a twenty-four episode series season and condense it down into a one hour show. You learned only some bare basics about a couple of the characters and the rest are just chum for the water. And that is a huge problem as we have two lead characters with Noel and Ninny, two secondary characters with Balgo and Macy, a tertiary character with Billy, and an antagonist with Bruno. But we only learned a little about Ninny and Macy. And we learn that dragons are apparently attracted to Balgo who is the comic relief really. Spoilers below The initial premise (other than defending against dragons), is that a group puts a hit order out on Balgo. So the girls have to attempt to keep him alive. Meanwhile, Ninny's friend is dragged to Reverse London because she has a pet dragon. So Macy is dragged into the fight between the girls and Bruno, as her dragon transforms into an all-powerful dragon and starts destroying Reverse London. And just as the fight is going to have to come to a climax, Balgo somehow transforms his horn into an almightly looking sword. So you think that Balgo may end up being the hero.

"Burn the Witch, more like burn the whole series. I’m going to keep this short and simple. Keep in mind, this may contain spoilers. I personally didn’t expect this to be a so-called ‘movie’ with 3 episodes. Let’s begin on how this ‘movie’ is presented. First episode, without a doubt, must give a big impression to the viewers, in this case Burn the Witch actually does. It starts with Ninny helping her friend Noel on doing contracts(?) and developed from that. Moreover, the first episode packs quite the action with cool scenes and effects which I find very pleasant to watch. However, the second episode was probably the point where it just collapsed. I don’t want to get into details on each episode so I will only discuss the (really) main plot. Balgo, a normal human being marked as a dragonclad, was to be executed for having contact with a dragon. Why is this like this you ask? Well I really don’t know why since the 'movie' didn’t give any proper context in the first place. I can’t really tell why the 'movie' didn’t give context but it just keeps on adding new things without really explaining it properly. It’s like there are 2 things happening at once, and then another 2 followed on, and so on. However, in these action packed episodes, it made me feel that there is much more that’s going to happen, and I personally was really looking into it. Guess what, the producers slapped my cheeks so hard and said ‘no more episodes and explanations for you, here take the somewhat good animation quality and stay quiet!’ The characters were fairly interesting by itself. We have Ninny, a tsundere-styled girl; Noel, an expressionless friend of Ninny; and Balgo, the ignorant guy that’s going to be important to the story. I described these characters with only a few words because mainly the studio didn’t give any background to them, or show who they truly are and what they’re capable of. It really made me feel like the characters aren’t important to the whole series. As for the visuals and audio, it is pleasing for me. Like I said, the art was pretty nice with a nice touch of style to it. The voice acting was fine, nothing really special about it, and the soundtracks were able to fit in well with the 'movie'. To sum up, Burn the Witch was a disaster when it comes to the pacing and plot. However if you’re looking for some short movie and just want to clear your mind without using too much brain power, this ‘movie’ is probably not the one you want to go with since it may leave you disappointed in the end.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_b47bf5953e,4
"I’ve been meaning to check out Burn The Witch since it was released on Crunchyroll last October. Despite its slick animation and memorable designs, as we’ve come to expect from Bleach creator Kubo Tite, this fiery fantasy unfortunately underwhelms. This could be symptomatic of the adaptation dropping so early into the manga’s run, but there was just too little character development and world-building for a setting that could have otherwise been great. Between ‘Dragonclads’, ‘Watchers’, and ‘Märchen’, there’s simply too much lore and not enough time to flesh anything out. I don’t always mind comedic subversions of dramatic moments, but this happens every single time something impactive arises, making it difficult to connect with the text. The characters, as cool as they look, are the tropiest tropes to ever trope. The clearest motivation and arc can be found in the black and blue-haired support who appears in part two, while the mains are just archetypal tsundere and kuudere, respectively. Burn the Witch felt more like a pilot episode than a feature, so if they come out with more, I’ll check it out, as I do think the overall story has potential. In the meantime, if you’re after a fantasy anime featuring dragons, I’d recommend Ancient Magus Bride instead.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 7, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_83735a53b7,4
"Most of us are here for one reason, we heard that Burn The Witch was written by the author of Bleach, it peaked our interest and so we gave it a chance. But what a disappoint it was. Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" in a 3 episode format, except they're not even full-length episodes. Each episode is only about 18 minutes long after you take out the screen time used for the ending. This means that Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" that isn't even an hour long. Movies are already hard pressed for time when it comes to building an exposition, building up for a climax, and then an ending that wraps up everything nicely. Burn The Witch did none of this nicely. Art: 6 Nothing is really wrong with the art and animation. I actually fairly enjoy the art style and have no issues with it. The reason I'm giving it a 6 however is because this is supposed to be a ""MOVIE"". However the art and animation just feels like a standard anime. There are many anime that look much better than it. Sound: 5 Not much to say here. None of the songs really stuck out to me or really caught my attention. There was no song that made me go ""I want to listen to this again in my free time."" Story: 6 The format for the three episodes are as follows: Episode 1 - Introduction to Characters & World Episode 2 - Minor Backstory and Buildup to Climax Episode 3 - Climax and Conclusion. I will admit the first episode I think was very well done. It introduced the characters we would be seeing the most of us, it gave us a nice introduction to the setting and how the rules are in Reverse London when it comes to dragons. It even gave us a nice and entertaining fight with a dragon to show off what our main characters Noel and Nina can do. Episode 2 felt really rushed. I didn't really care much for Mary or the way she was introduced. It all felt sort of half ass done. This is where the 18 minute screen time really comes into play (I think. I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how religious it is the source material). It really hurt because not much time was allowed for proper build up. While I did enjoy episode 3 I also have some big complaints. They go on to fight this ""legendary"" dragon and they even go into some dialouge where they name all the legendary dragons BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS BECAUSE AFTER THEY BEAT THIS ONE DRAGON THE SERIES JUST ENDS. The last few minutes also didn't really feel like much of a proper ending as well, it more so just felt like a normal ending for a normal episode that would be continued later on. It literally just feels like I watched the first 3 episodes of a 12 or 25 episode anime. Why waste time naming all these legendary dragons when none of that will be explored, why give me an ending that doesn't feel like a movie ending and more so just feels like there should be an episode 4? This adaptation is literally based off of only the first 4 chapters of the Burn The Witch Manga. There is no chapter 5... yet. At the end of chapter 4 it says ""Season 2 Coming Soon."" I wish they would've just not adapted this until they had enough content for a full series. These 3 episodes just feel like an introduction to the setting and the legendary dragons, it does not feel like a movie because the story isn't complete. A movie has a complete ending, Burn The Witch just makes me feel like I haven't watched the other 9 episodes of a 1-cour anime.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_3ae37efcaa,4
"Hello there, as always watch something before anyone tells you anything! That being said, the mini-series was fine(don't let the other review tell you otherwise) but the feeling that there is still a hell lot more to offer was almost nauseating. If you've read any the reviews here you'll know that guys are pleased and are giving it a high score with the expectation that the manga will swoop in, sell big, explain things and more episodes will come our way. Woe unto thee who thinks the manga is going to solve any issues you may have had the show. Let me just list a few down. - The stoic stand in for Byakuya, who actually has an emotional side - The tsundere stand in for Renji, - The easy-going old-man that is far stronger than anyone else ever thought. - The references to past events that won't be covered - The references to a league of people or creatures who have some sort of power level stratification - Unexplained objects that do nothing but will somehow save the day - and many many more These are just some of the issues covered by SuperEyepatchWolf who has a great video addressing some of the issues he had with Bleach and the realization that that ugly head is rearing itself again just makes me depressed. Unfortunately, just try to think about what happens in the community when someone hasn't watched or played or read something from this split story. Stratification is what happens. There will be people who know the full story and those who don't. People will gate-keep. Some people will become outsiders. This at-least is my explanation why other reviews here start will full-fledged anime fans apologizing for not having read Bleach. Why is that a thing? We shape the industry because we are the clients, so the ugly head is not an ugly head. It's a mirror that shows me what the community is. Learn to distance oneself from the parasocial relationships one forms with characters, studios, staff, authors and artists/illustrators.

"The only thing I can say about this 'movie' ,is that its at most a meh. In reality I don't even think the anime deserves a 6, the only reason I gave that score is the animation and the sound design. Its way to short even for an actual movie, without the ending credits I don't even think the whole run time would reach the hour mark. Now don't get me wrong, if this was a full fledged 12-ep anime, it would be way way higher but as a 3ep 'movie' it just doesn't work. I think its an amazing anime with just a very short story (the manga is this short too).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_45113aca97,4
"I'm disappointed in everything that really mattered, the story, the characters and the world. The Art and the sound: Good, nothing to complain about, there weren't any scenes that I will remember tomorrow... The story: It feels like two people who didn't communicate at all about the story, wrote and animated the first and the second part, and then made a sloppy third part that kind of ties everything together. The characters: Imagine that each character is a painting, well all the characters in this anime are basically one color canvases, with a small splash of some other colors. If I said the horny one, the cold one, the crazy one, the greedy/ambitious one and the ambitious one without any morals, anybody who has seen the show will know who I'm talking about. Also to establish the character motivations for some of them, they decided to add one line that tells the audience what they desire. The world: It's even more disappointing then the characters, unlike the characters that never showed potential to be amazing, deep and memorable, it was, From the trailers it makes you imagine that there is some kind of struggle that the average person can't see, the dragons, but can feel the impact of, streets and building getting destroyed, this might even be the case, except for the fact that we don't get to see it, do see that chunks of the ""Reverse London"" get torn up, but they never explain if this effects the normal world. Also why is it called ""Reverse London"", are dragons not a thing anywhere else? Basically the more you think about it, the more you realize that important parts of the world aren't explained.

"Burn the Witch comes across as a promotional trailer for a bigger series rather than a standalone experience. It has well-designed characters and an intriguing setting. However, it feels superficial. And with the short runtime the plot feels rushed and underdeveloped, with little room for character growth. Despite the promising premise and visually stunning art, it is difficult to recommend in its current form, as it lacks substantial content and ultimately feels incomplete. Burn the Witch holds much potential, and it remains to be seen whether it will ever be fully developed into a more fleshed-out series, making it an interesting prospect for the future.",6,Mixed Feelings,"May 6, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_4a2233779a,4
"So let me get this straight... This was a *movie*? Not the first three episodes of a season? As a movie this is probably one of the most terrible things I've seen. You don't split a movie in 3 parts with different ending songs inbetween, and should certainly end in a way that suggests that the anime is not going to go on for another 10-20 episodes. I'm giving it a 5/10 just because it should be a 6/10 average anime of the season, it's just that it completely fails to be a movie. Should honestly give it a 2-3/10 because it's simply not a movie. It'd be like saying a 5min Youtube video is a manga, and then you rate it. Like no, that's not a manga. 2 decent enough MCs, interesting setting, fair OST (I dig the ending though), but this should've been a 12 episode show. Not a 3 episode ""movie"".

"Burn The Witch is a 2020 anime film based off of a Kubo Tite manga. That's right, the creator of Bleach. The anime version was handled by Studio Colorido. Which I've never reviewed anything by. Let's have a look. Story: Our story centres around the idea that there are two Londons. The London we know and Reverse London, where dragons roam and need to be kept under strict control. Our heroines are two witches, Ninny and Noel. They help bring a rampaging dark dragon under control only to find themselves entangled in a plot that's all about bringing down one of their friends. Here's the big problem with the narrative, there are a lot of things that aren't explained very well. The film throws out a lot of terms and concepts very quickly but never extrapolate on them all that well. For example, there are people who can come into contact with dragons but most can't and there's never a detailed explanation for why. It seems to be something to do with mana but the film never explains how mana works in its world. It's like Kubo wanted to set up a long series to follow up after Bleach, but he never got past the planning phase. This is also supposed to take place in the Bleach universe, but none of the abilities or creatures seem to operate anything like the fantasy creatures or abilities in Bleach. Which is weird. There's just no coherent reason for this and Bleach to be connected. The film also suffers a bit from a rushed climax with the big battle sequence ending with a disappointing anti-climax. To its credit, this film is full of interesting ideas that have a lot of potential. I could see this as a really good twenty six or more episode series with proper pacing and fleshed out concepts. The problem is it's an hour long film. I will also say, to its credit, it was fairly compelling throughout. Characters: My big problem with the characters was that I hated Balgo. He's one of those characters who comes across as a complete moron but he's supposed to be likeable because he's a friendly and inoffensive moron. I just really found him insipid. I do think that both Ninny and Noel are pretty interesting characters and I could see them becoming really complex given more time. But for the length, I don't think they could have been done much better. With most of the side characters you get the sense that Kubo has ideas for them but they don't really go anywhere and the characters themselves end up being a little lacklustre. Art: The artwork does look pretty good. I especially love the big dragon they face for the climax. The action is also interesting to see. There's a definite unique aesthetic to the way characters use magic in this and I'm kind of into it. Sound: The acting is pretty well done. Yamada Yuina, Tano Asami & Hayami Saori all perform strongly and there's not really anyone who does badly. Even the performances that aren't as good are still competent. The music is fine. Ho-yay: There's a little bit. The character Macy openly has a crush on Ninny. Areas of Improvement: 1. Extrapolate on how your world works. This film is full of potential that never quite gets reached and ideas that never get fleshed out properly. It would work so much better with a little time taken to flesh it out. 2. There's no reason for this and Bleach to take place in the same universe. Connecting these two is both unnecessary and doesn't make much sense. There's this sense of disconnect between the works and telling us that our heroines work in Reverse London's Soul Society just isn't an adequate connection. 3. Have a more satisfying conclusion. It's a bit disappointing that the big climactic battle just ends abruptly and far too easily. It makes the whole thing just feel unfinished. Final Thoughts: This is one of those works where there's clearly a lot of potential and some strong elements, but the potential is never fully realised and the strong elements are met with a lot of weaker aspects. Ultimately, I do think this is better than mediocre but not by a large margin. So, I'm giving it a 6/10.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 21, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0eb5242c82,4
"This is my first review I've done in a long time, for good reason....I am not a good reviewer but, here it goes. Burn the Witch...while you were a animation greatness galore, your pacing was confusing and you were way too quick, hell even boring at times. In my eyes, the animation studio should have waited for more material to go off of, but instead they decided to throw this at us, I hardly knew what was going on half the time even. While I enjoyed this anime, it was rushed. I am not a Bleach fan at all, so that may have played a part in this, but even still...I am sure most Bleach fans were at least a little confused as I am.

"Burn the Witch Review What if dragons weren’t just mythical creatures but an everyday part of life—and only a select few could control them? Burn the Witch, by Bleach creator Tite Kubo, explores this thrilling premise in a stylish, action-packed fantasy set in Reverse London. About the Anime Released in October 2020, Burn the Witch is a three-episode ONA (Original Net Animation) adapted from Kubo’s manga. The manga began as a one-shot before evolving into a short serialized story. The anime currently holds a solid 7.15 rating on MyAnimeList, reflecting its balance of quality and brevity. A Quick Summary The story follows Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, witches working for Wing Bind, an organization that manages dragons in Reverse London. As they tackle dragon-related incidents, their lives are complicated by Balgo Parks, a reckless civilian entangled in their dangerous world. Why You Should Watch It 1. Fans of Tite Kubo and Bleach Will Feel Right at Home While not reliant on prior Bleach knowledge, the series offers subtle nods to the franchise, including a connection to Soul Society’s Western branch. 2. Strong Female Protagonists Noel and Ninny steal the spotlight with their contrasting personalities and teamwork. Their dynamic elevates the story, offering a refreshing focus on capable female leads. 3. Kubo’s Signature Artwork From detailed cityscapes to stunning dragon designs, Kubo’s artistry is at its peak. Taking his time with this project has allowed him to craft visuals that stand out as some of his best. 4. Perfect for Busy Viewers With its short format (originally a one-shot, then a four-chapter manga and three-episode anime), Burn the Witch is easy to get into without a huge time commitment. Where It Falls Short The story struggles with limited character development for secondary figures like Balgo, Bruno, and Macy. While intriguing, these characters feel underutilized, leaving potential untapped. Before diving into the three-episode ONA, watch the Burn the Witch special episode. It’s a prequel that provides essential context for understanding the story and its world. Burn the Witch brevity may leave some craving more, but for fans of Kubo’s work, it’s a must-watch, If expanded in the future, it has the potential.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 14, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e86a4b2731,4
"I like the gist of story itself - I feel like its an asian take on harry potter (even though it is supposedly related to Bleach). Anime/UK crossovers can be really fun if done correctly. Tying together dragons and magic, which is important in asian culture, was an interesting choice. If you read the manga and did your research, the plot is pretty cool but if you are just watching this series(?) the plot has holes in it. To briefly touch on that point... this is technically a movie? but was split into a series? It honestly has no business being considered a series imo. This doesn't happen often, but I really did not like the artistic take. The animation, sounds, etc., just did not vibe well with me. The dichotomy between the detailed (nearly realistic) London scenery and grungy vibes vs. the characters simple design was unsettling but not in a fun way. It seemed like from one scene to the next the stylization changed without reason, which really threw me off. I also thought the dragons themselves looked horribly silly. I feel like overall this is a wash. It has high hopes, but is executed poorly. It is obvious that a lot of work went into making this, but at the same time it feels incomplete.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_918dfb1b66,5
"For the viewer: don't watch this now. Wait for more. I watched three episodes and was surprised to find that I had seen... a movie, apparently. Right now, while Burn the Witch is quite aesthetically appealing, it is a merchandising story so caught up in placing all the bells and whistles that it fails to be believable or likable. It contains the usual forms: girls with 'personality', throwaway cute characters, stereotype sandwiches, a quelle-meaningful MC catchphrase, thighs, and more thighs. The setting does raises interesting questions - what are dragons?, what is this new society? how does this magic work? - but it's neither well explained nor believable. In three episodes, half the city of London perishes under flames and explosions. That raises some follow-up questions: how is this city still standing? Why do people live here? The characters are also enjoyably frustrating. There is Ninny, our lovely MC, whose response to 'you destroyed half the city and killed thousands!' is 'where's my money!?', Balgo, the village idiot, stereotype gangster 1, stereotype cop 32, quirky anime council members 49-117, et cetera. The only persona who doesn't come with perennial facepalms is Noel; probably because her motives and personality are nil. Burn the Witch failed to be likable. I can't respect it; neither as a viewer expecting excitement nor as an author expecting craft. That said, the future may bring backstory and believability.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_77ee0ef44c,5
"The ratings speak for itself. It has been a few minutes I finished the ""movie"" and I am still to figure out what happened, or why it happened, or why should people care? Unless there is a follow-up anime planned, or they want you to follow the manga (which at the time of writing this is exactly at the same place), this whole clearly no-a-movie does not make any sense. There is no time to connect to any of the characters, the plot is...difficult to find. And without any kind of follow up, the ending is just anti-climatic. Nothing actually encouraging you to start following the mange or wait for any anime. By the end of the third episode, you are left wanting your hour or something back.

"First of all, I loved and watched every episode of Bleach, except for 2 arcs (being the Thousand Year ""flashback"" arc which I never got back around to watching and the Fullbring arc). I can also understand that people are hyped for the momentous return of Tite Kubo and Bleach in general. However, I do not agree that this ""Burn The Witch"" release is anywhere near an 8/9/10 - out of 10, far from it. I can just about handle people rating this a 7/10, which usually means ""above average"" or ""good"". In my opinion, Burn The Witch seems like a rushed-to-release OVA, rather than an actual movie. If we can even call it a movie, what with it being 3 episodes of 20 minutes. An hour is simply not enough time for any meaningful character development or plot development. The ""story"" follows 2 main characters and one recurring side character, all of whom are one-dimensional, bland, uninteresting and have zero quirks or traits that make them memorable. Not forgetting that the characters back-stories are given about 10 seconds of screen-time, or about 2 sentences worth of dialogue on-screen: Ninny: Ex-idol (I think?) from normal London that fights dragons in reverse London and wishes to be part of the ""blades"". Aims for merit points. She is a copy-paste of Hiyori (Vizard), with her hot-headed attitude, but lacks everything else. Noel: Air-headed, sullen-looking girl who aims for monetary gains and... well, I can't even remember if anything about her past was revealed. Reminds me slightly of Yashiro (Vizard), but has about as much personality as a potato. Balgo(?): so memorable I don't even think I got the name right. Only purpose is to be a nuisance and express his love and adoration of Noel (that comes from nowhere). Also comes from normal London, but got powers from somewhere that causes dragons to be attracted to him. Balgo's pet: literally only says ""show me your panties"", in a Kon-like fashion, but does nothing else. So, there are the 3 main characters. Boring, bland, one-dimensional and have 0 appealing factors to them. If I'm being brutally honest (which I guess I have been already), the character with the most development and intrigue is the ""Chief"", who is on-screen for about 5 minutes total over the course of the hour. What about the plot then? Is that any good? Nope, not really. To avoid plot spoilers, I can say that I can resume the plot in about 3 sentences and it's incredibly cliché and doesn't really go anywhere or do anything. There's some very slight explanation on how reverse London functions and that's the most interesting part of this movie, which could be mashed together in a 10-minute video. Wow, I've been harsh but that's what happens when stuff gets hyped and then underperforms. I'm less critical of ""trash"" anime, because it's expected to be trash. Are there any redeeming factors to Burn The Witch though? Yes! The art-style, art quality, music-score and animation quality are top notch! However, as beautiful as a game/movie/anime might look, if there's nothing besides that, it still falls flat. Story: 3/10 - Poor Art: 9/10 - Great Sound: 8/10 - Very Good Character: 2/10 - Dreadful Enjoyment: 3/10 - Poor Total: 25/50 Overall: 5/10 - Mediocre If this is a one-and-done deal for Burn The Witch, with no follow-up anime series, then this is a massive disappointment and waste of time. It also raises questions about the upcoming ""end of Bleach"" anime arc. Even if this ""movie"" is meant to be a teaser for such a follow-up series, then I really don't expect much from it at this point.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0f0a37ab7c,5
"Burn the Witch felt woefully incomplete, like the concept exists on its own and little effort was put in to ensure it became a polished end product. To begin with the story, there really isn't much of one to speak of, though it gives the distinct impression that there is a lot more the viewer doesn't get to see. One can only do so much with a scant 3 episodes, but even then the story felt terse, shallow, and generally uninspired. Which is a shame because the world that the story takes place in is unique, characteristic, and has a lot of potential. The art, meanwhile, is this anime's strongest point, hands-down. The art style impacts every level of this anime's visual language, from the detailed and striking backgrounds, to the fun and well-constructed character designs, and even down to the sheer fluidity with which they move through their world by way of very high-quality animation. The only artistic decision I take issue with is in the design of the 'witch gear' gun things used by our main two characters, Ninny and Noel. They don't don't really fit the rest of their aesthetic, and seem almost jarringly silly as a result. The sound was a very mixed bag. One the one hand The sounds of life, like shattering glass and explosions, are very good, and the music has the ability to be pretty impactful at certain moments. However, to begin my problems with the sound, I watched the English dub because this anime is supposed to take place in the UK, and I thought I'd immerse myself. What a mistake, as the dub is garbage, and features some really questionable translations. The voice actors, while I can tell have some talent on their own, aren't being utilized correctly here, and everybody's delivery is so stiff and unconvincing that I was unable to immerse myself at all, in fact. Also, the music, while fine half the time, lapses into this weird techno bass guitar fusion thing the other half of the time, and it just doesn't fit. That's it, it's a bad musical decision. The characters, thankfully, are pretty good, and the audience is presented with a cast of colorful, visually appealing, and easily memorable characters that each fill their own niche well and interact in vibrant and believable ways. In many ways, the characters pull the weight that the story should be pulling. Overall, Burn the Witch is a beautiful bite-sized adventure that, while not the worst thing I've ever seen, left me feeling grateful there were only 3 episodes.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 28, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_f4c7ed0cdf,5
"I really want to give this a better score, but I'm on the collective side of critics. I felt like I was part way into an anime, and had no idea what I was watching was a movie. I'm not sure if they have plans to make more of this, I know there's an on-going manga being published, but seeing a 3-part episodic Movie had me tilting my head: Was this it? Why did it feel like they set up 2 vast worlds for us, and then delivered... Basically nothing but bits and pieces of story. Story: 7/10 Solid 7 at that, because while it's fun, unique, creative, and leaves open a world of exploration and inventive creative ideas... At the end of the day, what we got was. 2 worlds, hundreds of questions, and no answers in sight for most of them. It's like they showed us this click-bait Youtube title, and then in side of it, we only got a small taste, and they said ""that's all you get."" I'm yearning for more, it's made me want to read the manga, so that's a plus in its favor, but beyond that... Man what an underwhelming performance on something that felt like it could be insanely awesome. Art: 8/10 It's always good when I'm trying to find a way to start a critique on art, and I'm finding myself rewriting, deleting, and rethinking what I'd like to post here. So this is what you get instead. It was beautiful, it gave me these great Bleach vibes (I enjoyed the Bleach artwork very much.) The animation was smooth, I had very little issues with any of it, aside from their 'witch kits'.. Being horns? Guns? Wands? I'm split on that at the moment. TL;DR wow, it was enjoyable to watch this art style. Sound: 6/10 I'm very harsh on sound tracks, and audio. If you have a lot to work with, a good studio backing, or scenes that have potential to blow up with the right tracks, and effects, I'm going to hold it against your show if it fails to deliver. At no point did I ever go ""wait what is this track called? Wow I need to check this artist out to follow more of their work"" It failed to stand out. But it wasn't unbearable. Characters: 6.5/10 I enjoyed the sassy, mixed with the stoic, the charming male character who just seems to be the air head of the group. There was some fun chemistry, but that's where the line mostly stops. You have no background for these characters, you're given the most shallow information on people that we're made to watch over an hour of. What's worse is they dangle small tid bits of information in front of you face, where you expect them to come out and elaborate on. Like my qualms with most shows in this filed... Potential wasted. Enjoyment: 6.5/10 I enjoyed it almost 60% of the way through, and then the other 40% I was left sitting around wondering... And?! ... Please give me something more... Did you just show me an array of characters and do jack with all? Overall a solid 6.5/10 for this one. I summarized all I'd like to say in my points above for those looking for a serious TL;DR: Wasted potential, no character presence, just chemistry. The story was lacking even though I had such high hopes. The artwork is it's biggest saving grace in my personal opinion, and ...

"To be frank, I didn't hate the series. I was just irritated... Although the premise of the story was good, the fatal flaw that the series had is the way it literally bombarded us with information. It gave the series a sense of messiness and the delivery of the information was JUST. SO. RANDOM. The exposition is terrible. That's all I have to say about it. Everything that happened in the series happened so fast, and it's hard to watch it and enjoy it because of the fact that we're trying to keep up. The characters were BARELY developed too.

It somehow has too many exposition and lore dumps, while also leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening at any given time. Each subsequent scene is a disparate mashup of half baked ideas at best, and incomprehensible nonsense at worst. Many characters are introduced and suddenly whisked away, never to be seen again. And the handful of characters that do stick around are bland and grating. However despite this, something about it all continues to stick in my mind. The animation during fight scenes is stunning, and the visual effects for the magic system are some of the best in the industry. The character designs of the two protagonists are top-notch, and even a few background characters are visually striking. The show hints at a greater and more interesting world (and it wasn't until the ending that I realized this was a Bleach spin-off). While the show doesn't give time to care about the characters, they're still quite enjoyable. Truly the protagonists stand out as being the most interesting characters worth paying any attention to. For this series, every great decision is preceded by two mediocre decisions and a bad one. With all this, I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the show that keeps me coming back. Throughout the day I find myself trying to piece it all together despite knowing it's an incomplete and defective puzzle. It's truly a mess of a show, but there's some potential there under all the rubble. If a sequel is ever released, I will definitely watch it, either for closure and clarity, or to see it all crumble. I truly hope it's the former.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_20f334f3b2,5
"7/10 (Will this ever be continued?) Over all this was a good watch and I am looking forward to what is next. The show is a bit too ""anime"" for my taste with the obsession over 'panties', arguments over first name/last name, In school? For some reason and the mc being an... idol? Maybe? Other then these small basic quoms about the show, it was beautifully animated, had a compelling world and interesting enough power/magic system. I really just hope this is just in the world of bleach but has nothing to do with it. I personally think bleaches story is atrocious and terribly written and very convoluted for no reason. Hopefully the writter learned from that and doesn't make the same mistake twice.",7,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_55d2b4eb6d,5
"Okay so the short 3 episode animation of Burn the Witch had so much potential from a perspective of someone who's never read the manga. However it's falling so flat that it hurts. The animation and character design? Amazing. But I can't get past the fact that the story is as dry as a saltine cracker, it's not long enough for me to feel connected to the characters but it's also not short enough that I'm not loosing focus on the show. The action scenes don't make me lurch with excitement and the lack of character development that the show gives is rather disappointing. Overall I'd give it a 4.5/10. I'd recommend it but there is so much lost potential. [9:14 PM] Also the way the world building is just there? Gross. I hate everything about it. It feels like I'm reading a Wiki article. I give it essentially a 3 for art, 1 for Balgo, and .5 for potential...",4,Not Recommended,"Oct 8, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_3ad19300f2,5
"This review is spoiler-free. First off, this isn't what I'd call a movie, but rather a mini-series or something of the sort. It consists of 3 poorly-linked Anime episodes of 20ish minutes (standard, if you will). Story - 3 There's barely any introduction to the MCs (only a little bit of backstory that's mostly left out to the viewers' interpretation rather than being expanded on or explained). There isn't much to the story honestly, besides meaningless encounters and fight scenes that escalate too quickly and weirdly to be taken seriously. Trying to fit all of it in 3 20-minutes episodes was probably a mistake, since the many roughly touched-on parts of the story couldn't be explained or further explored and developed. To the viewer, it's like the story is simply filled with holes and appears to make no sense (at least to me, that's what it felt like). Also, the transitions between the 3 episodes don't make sense at all to me. That's probably the main reason it didn't feel like a movie when watching them back to back. Art - 6 The Art itself isn't that bad, but it really isn't movie quality (if you compare it to popular and well-ranked movies like Your Name, Weathering with You and such). It's also not a complete and utter dreadful experience for the viewer since there's a consistency - the characters, the environments, the colors used, etc. are always the same and keep the flow steady and natural for the viewer. Sound - 6 I found that one of the supporting characters was truly bugging me and part of it was because of its voice. I simply found it annoying and it sort of ruined the experience for me. Everytime that character was involved in a situation and talked, I'd just roll my eyes in exasperation (yes, it was that bad for me). Otherwise, the music and sound effects were okay, nothing worthy of mention or anything very powerful or too emotional. Just plain decent and basic sounds/music that help the viewer understand what's happening. Characters - 3 As I said in the Story part, there's barely any introduction to the MCs. Whilst watching, I felt like they had no depth since there wasn't any backstory shown or explained. There were little pieces of information left here and there, stuff that the viewer could deduce or interpret their way, but no real background story or anything of the sort. This resulted in pretty bland/generic and boring/annoying characters. I couldn't care less if any of them were to get into a relationship, lose something valuable or whatever. I couldn't find anything to relate to or get attached to. They felt empty to me, void of any substance. Enjoyment - 2 Pretty dull. I didn't really enjoy watching this ""movie"". It kinda felt like a chore to me, just to add it to my Completed Animes list. After seeing it advertised and looking up this Anime, I had high expectations but sadly, they weren't met at all. Most of the action was pointless and provided no character development, if any at all. The show brought up so many unanswered questions in my mind (and didn't answer them) that I didn't understand the point of watching it. Nothing joyful happened, nothing saddening nor heartbreaking happened, it's just the same-old bland and boring meaningless story of stuff happening to the MCs for absolutely no reason other than to make something happen to fill the 60ish total minutes of the show (""movie""). Overall - 4 Yeah, that's just the average of the scores I've given this show. I've got nothing more to say about this so-called ""movie"", except go watch it if you want, but lower your expectations for it first. It's not deserving of a score as high as it is right now. As the score of 4 indicates, it is in my opinion a ""Decent"" show, no more, no less.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 13, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_c935078cc6,5
"In which dimension was this a good idea to realease this not as a pilot for a full series but as a 3 episode film (if it aired like this in japan and its not just a decision made by crunchyroll). The generall setting of this Anime/Film, a magical second London with dragons, could make a good Anime/Film but After watching these 3 episodes you just ask yourself, where the next episode is or even a conclusion of that Film/Anime, because it just felt like it was like a start to some interesting series but no ist just ends abruptly just like it started. The story revolves around two Girls who aparently work for a company who does things with(like catch?) Dragons or some mythical animals, where the protagonists get money and fame points from that. One of them is a Idol(in the real london) (and is getting catched by paparazzi becasue aparently tabliods press is one of the main story points?) sundere(Spangcole, Ninny), who likes fame, and the other one is a kuudere who likes money(Niihashi, Noel). The only kind of personality which is explored is that Ninny has a friend in the ""normal"" London from their idol band and Noel likes that one boy they meet. The thing is even this seems very shallow it could had potential because the setting could be interessting if its explored in greater detail. This magical london with its conection to dragons the conection between normal humans from this london and dragons and whiches (male and female aparently), the magic from these, the secretary council with their(could be) intereseting powers and names, the boss of their organisation and and and. The whole story just seems lackluster in comparison to other series and just bad if you compare it to a well written film. One good point i have to add is the art it reminds me of the art in bleach(its both written by kubo), combined witch this series/films unique interesting design. Like, that the second London has smaler houses and everything is covered in some moss. In addition the sound design and music is quite interesting. By all means this film/series isn't bad or cheap or just low quality, the art is cool its an interesting setting and the sound isnt that bad but after watching it you just feel like you watched like the 10./11./12. episode of a 25 episode series. Its just sad that its so short it could be so much more. In conclusion its mediocre.

"I don't have all that much to say. I didn't expect much of a story considering it was never Kubo's strong suit in Bleach. However, it seems either Kubo himself was trying to overcompensate for that in this project, or there was no direction in the studio's adaptation (I have not read the source material mind you) Kubo's art and the animation steals the show, no question about it. There are some fun moments here and there, hell I caught myself chuckling once or twice. And the world that is built doesn't seem too original, but distinct enough to intrigue me nonetheless. Otherwise there isn't much to say to praise it. I hope that there is more to come as I do think that if there is more time for the story to come into its own, it can be something good. However for now I find this to be anime junk food. A quick watch that catches the eye, but nothing substantial for it to be remembered as it is.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9f87be90ac,5
"Initial Thoughts: Alright, so this is my first review. I hope to write it somewhat well! I did like this movie. It wasn’t mind-blowing to me, but I do find the concept of it pretty fun. The movie is set in two versions of London: Front London (the London that appears in our world) and Reverse London (the London full of magic, witches, and dragons). The world of “Burn the Witch” gives me many Harry Potter vibes, which I am not at all opposed to seeing. The whole movie sort of feels like a nod towards that franchise. However, it doesn’t appear to be as fleshed out as Harry Potter. There is still a lot left to the imagination on how magic in this universe works, what the different organizations in the world of Reverse London are, and how it interacts with Front London. It's not even clear on who the villains are. Are they the dragons themselves, or are they the shady council people trying to capture Balgo? Who’s to say?! But perhaps that’s the point of the movie-it’s meant to throw you, the viewer, into this fantastical world of dark dragons and spunky witches. You’re meant to experience the world on a joyride, not analyze it. Story: The story was fine. Not something that blew me away, but it also didn’t bore me half to death. As I stated above, there are still plenty of questions about how the world of this movie works that are left unanswered. That’s a bit frustrating, but again maybe that was international. The story itself is also quite fast-paced. It’s as if the movie cobbled together three episodes from the middle of an anime and tried to condense it into an hour-long window. It’s not so fast-paced that the viewer is confused about what is happening, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. The story's main conflict appears to be whether or not Dragon Clads should be protected or killed. That’s all fine and good conflict...but as the movie progresses, it appears the problem is less with the Dragon Clads and more with the dragons themselves? The Dragon Clads are sort of just...there. Attracting dragons, I guess, but the movie never really goes into a lot of depth on just how dangerous a Dragon Clad could be...especially since Balgo and Macy aren’t dangerous characters. You could call Macy unhinged, but she doesn’t have malicious intent. Burn the Witch’s story isn’t all bad, though. I like all of the references to fairy tales and seeing how Ninny thinks they’re all a load of bull. Although the movie never really goes into detail about why Ninny thinks this way either. The fights scenes and learning about the lore of the dragons and world itself are quite fun. That sentence could sum up the story, I suppose. Fun, but it doesn’t appear that the movie will go into more depth than that. Rating: 3/5 Characters: The characters were ok. Not much to write home about. We have Ninny, who lives a dual life as a celebrity in Front London and a witch in Reverse London. She hates fairy tales, is spunky, wants recognition for defeating dragons...and that’s her character. The majority of characters are fairly surface-level without going into a lot of depth about them. Noel is the quiet side-kick, Balgo is the goofy but lovable Dragon Clad, Bangnyfe is the cool but intense wizard who wants to kill Balgo for his own gain, and Macy is a girl who’s in love with Ninny and is clueless in a magical world. I blame the movie's running time for not giving the audience a chance to get to know the characters more. Maybe they appear surface-level now, but a proper series could expand on their potential for being great and memorable characters. The character designs aren’t too bad, though. In fact, they’re quite good! Bangnyfe looks the coolest out of everyone, in my personal opinion, haha. Rating: 2/5 Animation: The animation was really, really good! Probably the best part of the whole movie, if I’m quite honest. It was fluid and vivid, and the action scenes flowed splendidly. There wasn’t anything done that was too experimental. It was just a good shonen animation. There was some CGI animation that was implemented too. I always get nervous seeing CGI animation in anime, but this honestly didn’t bother me much. In fact, it was well-executed for once! If there were animation mistakes or awkward stills, I didn’t really see them myself. Rating: 4/5 Voice Acting: Again, also very good. All of the voice actors conveyed their character’s personalities well and were all pleasant to listen to. I absolutely adored Balgo’s VA. He did such a good job striking a balance between “awkward” and “adorable” in his performance. It’s such a shame that Balgo’s character writing was just so...well, bad. Rating: 5/5 Music: I’m a bit reluctant to write about music since I don’t tend to pay attention to it much. Unless it’s something really unique, but the music for Burn the Witch was fine-nothing particularly stood out, but it did do its job carrying the scenes along. Rating: 2/5 Closing Thoughts: While there are still many questions left unanswered about the movie's world, I would recommend giving this a watch. In my personal opinion, I would like to see this fleshed out a bit more as a regular anime series than as a movie. If there ever will be a show, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for that. But for now, check this out if you’re interested and scratch that itch for Harry Potter in an anime world.

"I can safely say I regret buying into the hype for this ""movie"". It seemed like it tried to keep the plot ""mysterious"" but all it succeeded in doing was confusing my partner and I more. We asked multiple times what something was only to never get an answer. The ""movie"" introduces multiple things in the beginning episodes with no explanation. Another user mentioned it feels like you're watching episode 6 out of 12 without having watched any of the other episodes and I couldn't agree more. It almost seems like the storyboard workers expected you to know the foundation of the story despite never explaining it. The characters are decent, somewhat predictable, but decent. However, with such little time and such little background and development on them, I had no attachment and thus in the final episode could not care less how they felt. The only thing saving this ""movie"" from a horrible review in my opinion is the quality of the art in the anime and the character design. Otherwise, there's no point in watching. I'd be happy to change my mind if they come out with a full in-depth anime or perhaps multiple movies to a series, but until then I'll see this as an overhyped project that doesn't deserve the recognition it's recieving.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9c480e9482,5
"Such an oddly put together anime, I believe I should've read the manga before having this been my introduction to Burn the Witch. The anime starts you off in what feels like the middle of the series in an extremely vague setting and only gets more comboggled; with vague implications of these character's relationships, their power systems, and their motivations. At the very least, Kubos character design is more than amazing. There were so many instances where I found myself pausing to admire the design of certain character's outfits ie, Sullivan Squire. And some where I began to question how boring and odd some of the choices for these character's designs were ie. Bruno and Balgo. It doesn't help that backgrounds/scenery of the anime, like a lot of modern animes, looks so artificial. Really scratching my head after this one. A lot of squandered potential here.",4,Not Recommended,"Apr 16, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_5a90483471,5
"This anime has a disastrous montage. Burn The Witch is anything but a movie. The biggest problem that prevents any internal logic is the way it was distributed by Crunchyroll. The movie was perforated like a seasonal anime, and the transition between the 3 episodes is disastrous, the narrative tone of each episode gives the feeling that the story is going to be much bigger than it really is. In the little show time we have, the anime tries to develop an internal problem that doesn't work or just doesn't matter, and tries to assimilate that with a drama of some characters that does not move. When I finished watching, it got that feeling of something unfinished. It can even be a very rich anime visually, but it does not explore any of this, the anime universe is very artificial, it seems that the characters were taken from another world, and played there in the middle. To conclude, Burn The Witch was not able to enchant at any time thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers who seem to me to have prioritized a visual part without correctly assimilating it as the work's unity.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_aaf851ef92,6
"Well, this movie was nice to watch. It really brought back that Bleach nostalgia. While I can't even to begin to express how glad I am that I could experience Burn The Witch immediately as it released, it wasn't a flawless masterpiece. It tried to tell way too much story that could naturally fit in a one hour movie. The world building wasn’t as strong as it could have been. If only this movie had an extra 20-30 minutes to its runtime, like a normal length animated feature, it would have flowed a lot smoother and could have fleshed out the characters and world a bit more. Some things weren't explained fully and the characters didn't have enough time to become fully developed. This is especially true for Balgo, who is easily the flattest and least interesting character in the movie. There is a moment at the end of the movie where two characters hug (sort of), and it feels so random and comes so out of nowhere, that you would think that there actually was a prequel movie to this, since nothing in the movie made it seem like they were on hugging terms. Another flaw I would give this movie would go to the animation team at studio Colorido. While the fight scenes were well animated for the most part, a lot of the still frames felt stiff. While that may seem like an obvious thing to say, it felt stiffer than most still frames feel. Some of the CG was off-putting as well, but most of the CGI was integrated well. Now for the positives, as I said before, the action scenes were well animated for the most part. They were very slickly and stylishly animated and the CGI was integrated well most of the time. The Marchen (legendary dragon) was animated nicely as well. The entire backstory scene with Macy and Elly was presented wonderfully. The ED song was nice and the soundtrack fit. The voice cast was all solid as well. Most of the cast had great designs. The character designs were very Bleach-like and they looked great in this setting. Also, it is just nice to see the Bleach references and to just be back in the world of Bleach. The main characters, Noel and Ninny, are really likable (even if not fully developed), and they really had a natural and believable chemistry between them. This movie was enjoyable, although I went in to the movie already loving it, so I have a bias. That being said, I think that non-Bleach fans will have a harder time enjoying it than Bleach fans. There will probably be more animated Burn The Witch content down the road, so it will be interesting to see where the series goes from here.

"Burn the witch made me feel like I was watching the 6th episode (and only the 6th episode) in a 12 episode series. The first part of the anime jumps straight into action with minimal information. We get about 2 minutes of the anime establishing the setting, another 2 minutes of vague implications about who and what people are, and then all of a sudden we’re fighting dragons in the middle of the street. The lack in background isn’t so bad that you can’t follow what’s going on, but the anime would have been a million times better if everything had been laid out properly before the plot started escalating (which is how stories usually work). On a positive note, I thought the sounds were amazing. The greatest selling point of this anime would probably be the background music which fit the scenes very well. The music had a magical vibe that was perfect for the plot. It was also very innovative since it combined different kinds of sounds: modern sounds, orchestral sounds, and even some really cool vocals. I enjoyed the effects and outro too. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_881af0dfbb,6
