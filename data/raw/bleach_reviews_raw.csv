"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything bragworthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsical of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbreat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to melliflous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and endign themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, desptie what Naruto fans, shonen haters or anyone else have said. It's pretty enjoyable despite its lacks and faults, mostly in thanks to its great cast.

"Bleach will always warm my heart no matter how many times I watch it. There are scenes in this anime that I consider iconic to the anime community, regardless of how many people disagree with me, I truly believe Tite Kubo inspired greatness in so many fans. He has the most beautiful artwork I've seen in manga, and while the anime doesn't quite reach the level of skill Kubo possessed, it still presented a beautiful adaptation of his story in a way that impacted millions of people around the world. You can argue that it has cliche moments, or maybe some flat characters, and yeah, the ending was extremely rushed (due to Kubo's poor relationship with his publishers), but none of that matters when compared to the enormous amount of fans who adored Bleach. A community of millions of people were all brought together when Ichigo showed us the power of a human. The strength, emotion, and pain of a human. Human understanding and suffering and friendship and human values. It's not about swords and power ups. Bleach taught us how to love, how to protect, and how to overcome our weaknesses. This is a fictional story with very REAL lessons. And while there are other anime and stories that can teach us about life, there is nothing quite like Bleach. The story captured me at every moment, I could relate to every struggle, and I felt my heart melt at every tragedy. I know that not every person will experience something the same way. I know there are many people who feel disconnected from Bleach. But as for me and the Bleach fans around the world, we gained something by watching this treasure. I have a passion and a strength that developed every time Ichigo fought and won his battles. The soul society became my allies. Ichigo's friends were my friends too. Ichigo became my hero. I started this series back when I was 15 years old and even though I'm 22 now, I still find personal strength and encouragement from watching my hero fight for the good in this world. I believe this will live in my heart and mind until the day I die. Bleach is not unworthy of praise, because it truly helped at least one person on this earth find happiness. Nothing is meaningless. Even if only one person finds value in something, it's worth it. Thank you.",10,Recommended,"Jan 24, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fdbfdd75ef,1
"*NO SPOILERS* Bleach had great potential, but became annoying with poor character development and random powers. Bleach has one of my favorite concepts ever. The Soul Society is awesome and the Gotei 13 are probably the best part of the show. They are squads composed of a multitude of Shinigami(Soul Reapers) and the show focuses more on the Captains and Lieutenants of those squads that are the most interesting characters in the show. Although, their could have been less squads(like 6) with less members in them(like 5) to have a more focused cast of characters that get more development. Hollows are also very interesting, they are souls that have either decide to let themselves be taken by evil or have been capture by other hollows. The basic concept is that the Soul Society dispatches Soul Reapers to purify the souls of hollows to let them live in the Seretei(basically heaven) unless they were evil while human( then they go to hell). The Soul Reapers use their swords called Zampakuto, that have 2 transformations to purify hollows. The story of Bleach is ok, it is basically a regular shounen protagonist (Serious while fighting and Over powered) vs a traitorous, power hungry, intellectual villain. Bleach biggest problems are its disrespect of its own power level system, its useless side characters, its horrible explanations for certain powers and its fillers.. Bleach doesn't make sense when it comes to power levels, a character can be defeated by an opponent, and then can defeat someone that utterly destroyed that opponent without training or power ups. I don't know how to describe it without spoilers but the power level system is non existent and it is really aggravating to not see that system in place. Ichigo, the main character, will discover some new ability to beat his opponent that is portrayed as being way more powerful than Ichigo, this will happen multiple times. Ichigo is easily defeated by the main antagonist(villain), that same villain levels up 5 times and is defeated by Ichigo who trained for 3 months. What? at least don't make the villain level up 5 times so it makes more sense. The side characters in bleach are useless. The Captains and Lieutenants aren't, but Ichigo's friends are. First off, Orehime Inoue, F**K is this character annoying. Shes is the typical damsel in distress, she is hot, she tries to be extra cute and she has stupid powers that have no explanation(Maybe Fullbringer). Orehime's only use is healing Ichigo so he can get back into a fight. Chad has *MINOR SPOILER* Fullbringer powers, these are probably the stupidest powers in the Bleach universe. Fullbringer is the abillity to control the souls found inside objects. WTF!! an object has a soul? I guess it does in the Bleach universe. Uryu Ishida is probably the on except-able friend Ichigo has. Uryu is a Quicy, they are similar to soul reapers, but instead of using a sword they use a bow and arrow. They also kill hollows instead of purifying them. The problem with all three of these characters is they become to weak to participate in battles except Uryu who can still provide support in battle. Bleach is almost 50% filler. These can be skipped if you binge watch Bleach but on a week to week basis it can be really annoying to have to watch filler almost every other arc. Although Bleach has a huge list of problems I was still hooked until the last cannon arc because the concept of Bleach was so interesting. The Soul Society and the captains are the main reason I continued to watch the show. The most annoying part of Bleach for me was its lack of explanation and logic for powers, Ichigo's friends that shouldn't have existed, especially Orehime and the fact that the main characters can just come full circle and defeat a character that should be way above them in terms of power.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 28, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_781225b67d,1
"Story: Bleach is a mixed bag as far as story goes. The first arc (ep1-63), which covers the soul society, is interesting and engaging. It contains both action and a good plot. However, after episode 63 things go downhill. A lot. The Bount arc which follows it isn't even in the manga and has no relevance to the overall story, as well as being entirely uninteresting. It picks up a bit when the story shifts back to the plotline of the manga, but there isn't much of a plot to follow at that point. Basically, the main characters fight the bad guys from there on out with little else of interest to be found. If the action was great, it might make up for this, but it isn't. While it isn't terrible, it is never enough to carry the anime by itself. In addition, there are frequent fillers, which I would recommend ignoring entirely if you decide to watch this. Aside from the generally uneventful plot, Bleach suffers from an unwillingness to kill off anyone. Despite having tons of shinigami, Bleach never kills off a single one. The only characters who ever die are the bad guys, and very few of them ever perish either. If I were rating only the first arc, I would give this a 7 or an 8, but the decay which has happened since then forces me to drop it significantly to a 5. Art: Character design is excellent, overall very solid animation. It does occasionally have issues though. Sound: Sound is generally good, music appropriate to the mood. No complaints here. Character: This is where Bleach should shine, but doesn't. As said before, character design is great. However, there are so many characters that none of them get any sort of development. With the sheer volume of characters in the show, even main characters are often forgotten for several episodes. Most of the characters seem like they would be interesting if developed, but they simply aren't. Overall: I would recommend watching the first 63 episodes and dropping it there. Aside from the Turn Back the Pendulum story (206-212) there is essentially nothing of value plotwise after that point. If you're only in it for the action, I suppose Bleach is a decent show. But even in that case, you could do much better.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 1, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_70c7a0361a,1
"Bleach has become one of the most popular anime around, and is commonly if not always, compared to Naruto. Hated by many, loved by many, this anime will be watched by virtually everyone who dives into the anime world. Story: The story, or perhaps setting to be more accurate, is quite unique. Shinigami, or Soul Reapers, that have their own special society watch over the souls in the living world. Each Shinigami carries a unique sword(soul slayer) or Zanpaktou that has its own unique name and abilities based on the wielder's style and personality. Alongside them are the Hollow, and two subgroups later to be known as the Vaizard and Arrancar. It is this unique setting that gives Bleach the power to create so many characters under such a captivating environments, and this I believe, is one of the story's strong points. In terms of plot, it isn't very strong. The whole 'rescue a friend' is seen in pretty much every anime, and the whole 'I need to get stronger to protect my friends' is equally overdone. But I personally enjoy watching series with this type of theme, so I can't mark it down because of such overdone plot devices. But Bleach also comprises by adding a few twists into a seemingly transparent storyline, and it is here that I again am impressed. Bleach isn't just about mindless violence, its about friends striving to help each other, looking out for each other and improving themselves. Theres a bit of romance tossed in too, so thats a bit of a plus. The great setting and positive themes of friendship and perseverance made me give this an : 8/10 Characters: Bleach has a huge number of characters, some of them developed fairly well, otherwise poorly. But it is the huge cast of such unique and usually admirable individuals that makes this anime so captivating. You just hold your breath everytime someone pops into release their soul slayer or release their Bankai. It's because of all these characters and their own unique swords and abilities that makes the fights in this anime worth watching. You just can't wait to see what the characters are capable of. In terms of character development, I would say that it isn't bad, especially in terms of Ichigo who starts off as a badass that can take down most hollows with ease. In time, (particularly the current arc) he realizes how insignificant he really is, and tries his hardest to get stronger. The same is similar for the other characters such as Chad. Although most of the character development is in terms of strength and not so much in personality, I still rate the characters high for their largely unique cast: 8/10 Sound: This I find, is one of Bleach's strongest qualities. The soundtracks really intensify the battles and make even the smallest things seem cool. Thats that Bleach is good at - making things seem cool, and the soundtrack is a key and necessary component. But it isn't just the action scenes. It makes the sad and thoughtful moments come alive, in addition to the mysterious and tense situations Bleach presents. It's also accompanied by some of the best opening and closings I've seen in anime, in terms of both music and visuals. They greatly depict the story and the songs set the mood beautifully. 10/10 Art/Animation: I have little to say here. The art is quite good for the most parts, and I loved the coloring in the first few arcs, particularly the bright glowly/misty colors. Most of the fights are animated very smoothly with a variety of scenes and angles and such. Its on par with most anime these days: 8/10 Overall: Bleach is one of my favorite anime, being one of the first I ever watched. I know most people consider it over rated, repetitive and predictable, but hey, it presents some epic fights and follows them through nicely. Most of the fights are a good length (couple episodes) and I'm a fan of swords and people who power up, so what can I say, this anime is gold to me. If you're the type that doesn't care too much about a complicated story or deep compelling characters and you just want to see some epic fights, Bleach is right for you. This deserves an 8/10 overall (bogged down with fillers too much, although I didn't take that into account while rating. Fillers aren't part of the show, just don't watch them =/ ), but I personally love it and rated it a 10/10 on my list.",8,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ffb31e4fbd,1
"---- Spoilers (FIRSTLY THIS SEIRES CONTAINS AT LEAST 40-55% FILLER! ) Bleach: This anime is a cluster-fuck! Nothing more, nothing less. The concept of bleach is actually decent, and it's execution was 8/10 right up till episode 63. The relationship between hollows , humans and shinigami(death gods) was interesting and continued to progress into a rescue mission . This anime honestly should of ended as that! But instead we get shitty plot after plot hole, deus ex machina(shikai >bankai> hollow mask>hyper bolic time chamber) and basic shounen formula... the current manga for this series is in such a shit-hole that there is literally no hope for this series in my opinion ESPECIALLY with the death of Tsukada Masaaki the voice actor of yammamto. Essentially, the plot for bleach has devolved to a transparent sequential pattern>> i.e ( antagonist enters op status ( aizen) where it canonly be matched and beaten by ultra op status ( ichigo))>> the end. STORY 4/10 It's saddening that really the only redeeming quality of this series is the sound !Shirō Sagisu the music producing god behind such titles such as NGE , black bullet and ofc BLEACH! 9/10 ART: for the first 63 episodes art was definitely 8/10 , honestly even with the lower ratio, the quality of animation and art were superior to the other 300 so episodes... In fact I'd go as far as to say that every episode after 63 is 4/10 in art rounding to 6/10 overall . Characters are thrown into the series in hope that the viewer will like at least one, the main problem with this is that there is virtually not nearly enough time to distribute to each character evenly leaving low amount of needed character development and understanding. 5/10 Enjoyment: There are definitely some good fighting scenes, but there is way too much inconsistency in the story and the power levels between the characters leaving for some predictable plot. 5/10 Overall this series is mediocre as fuck, and it's a shame. I really felt kubo could of rapped up this series ages ago and went on to another one... the first 63 episodes of bleach had a certain flavour to it that couldn't be tasted by any other anime just the versatility of the characters and the interaction between them were interesting. BUT FILLER AFTER FILlER + the cannon material becoming saturated really made this series barely watchable! 4/10",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_48220b7017,1
"Bleach is a good choice for you if you're looking to observe the process of the mainstream anime of the 2000's and what they tried to pull off to sell and stay relevant. Outside of the popularity that it got, I see Bleach as a very stale and mediocre anime, which I'll go and detail in the review later, but I'd like to start with the cause and then the effects. You see, Bleach is a product of a time when a shounen reaches popularity to an extent that it can be milked, hinduism will then sue the studios and authors in question for treating their cattle with such disrespect, because those innocent cows have like four japanese businessmen attached to all ends of the udder, with them chugging the milk hard. The strategy was to sell it like it's crack-cocaine, because people will love it and people will buy it because it is something that fits their business strategy. But how did the studios get the warm & sweet cow milk? Here, I'll guide you through it if you wanna do the same. First of all, the source material needs to have garnered some popularity from the target audience desired. Then, as your next step you make sure that it is gonna be a battle shounen and that it does feature some form of fanservice. Third, you make sure to influence the source material in a way that the show will keep its cast mostly out of mortal danger and will turn any of the cool villains into protagonists. And also make sure that nobody dies so you can milk the character popularity too. Fourth make sure you never take a break from airtime ever and air constantly, even if there is no content to adapt. Create filler arcs so the author has time to write content for the anime to adapt. They don't have to be memorable or interesting, you already hooked in the audience. They'll watch anything, so they don't deserve any quality. And then you are set for as long as the author complies. Some free advice on how to keep animating content and delay running out of source material: Make sure to rehash as much material as possible, showing as many flashbacks as possible whenever the character reminisce something important or just make a bullshit reason like trying to remind the audience what the characters are fighting for. It will help you plenty. Don't forget you think your audience is just filled with complete idiots. Very important. What shows like Bleach aspired to be was the next Dragon Ball, because that for most was like crack-cocaine. Since the DB franchise did it first, we just have to do it and make sure we capitalize on all the things it did and make our shows as close in execution as possible, and not risk anything because it won't sell. This is kinda why shows like Bleach disgust me. They just don't aspire in any way to be artistically distinguishable and just try to be the same thing as their spiritual predecessors. They treat their audience like garbage and the only reason I came come up with for such a thing is the reward, which is the money. If this business scheme worked, why not use it? Each of these goliath shounen shows have some varying degree in certain aspects of sins in these departments, but they're all the same when boiled down. Another attempt at getting another Dragon Ball on the market. If you can't respect that, you can just stop reading the review, you read enough. If the show will have potential early, it will dissapoint you because it went nowhere with it. If it won't, you'll be dissapointed again because you had nothing to show for at all after spending some time through it. But if you still hold some interest for Bleach, keep reading, because now I'll get into the actual show itself. But note that I'll spoil some things in the story for like the first 15 episodes of the show. The show has 366 episodes so it kinda is hard to not give you any specifics on the story's direction without giving you any specifics. I strongly advice reading despite that, I did my best to avoid it being plot specific and in a series like Bleach, having a little knowledge of what you'll watch, from where I'm standing, is strongly adviced. The story of Bleach early seems to be about a high school student who gets super powers and has to fight and protect people from spirits that failed to pass away to the other world. And for the most part, he spends his time going through high school featuring some slapstick humor along the way and then, in his responsabilities as a shinigami, he has to fight gigantic monstrous beings with a big fucking sword. Sounds like nothing. As a matter of fact, for the most part, Bleach is mostly generic in terms of its action and story, but it does have a high point. In its introduction arc the series does build itself up. First it does build up the main character, and his overall attitude towards saving people. He isn't unwilling to save people that he sees that do need help, but he isn't exactly accepting of the idea that he would go around and make a day out of it. The way he described it at the time that ""Of course I'm gonna help someone if I see they need it. But I don't want to seek doing it."" And for a while the series tries to convince him to get to do what he can to take care of everyone and Ichigo constantly does it reluctantly. But that plays into a meaningful decision. Another thing that was constantly built up in the series was the Spirit Society, a society governed by people with the same powers as Ichigo, responsible for the protection of spirits and fighting against corrupt ones. The character responsible for Ichigo having to fight these spirits leaves in order to protect him and not make him also suffer consequences as a result of her actions. He is unsatisfied with her decision and runs off to find her. And so he does, just to find another two people, of whom one proceeds to destroy him in battle, with him being a subordinate of the other. And then a meaningful thing happens. After this sore defeat, Ichigo decides to try and save her. To infiltrate Soul Society. After losing his powers. And after being overpowered. He made a decision about who he wants to protect and why, and goes in to save her despite all odds, in a world filled with an uncountable number of people who might be potentially much more powerful than him, willing to simply just go alone. It feels like an adventure with odds stacked against him with who knows what might come against him. The show is respectable at that point and the decision makes sense and feels meaningful. The Soul Society Arc is pretty much where the non-fanatics of Bleach agree that the show was at its strongest. And I'm one of those people. Now don't worry, I'll stop with the spoilery stuff now, so you won't have to worry about what you'll read on ahead. All I will say that in the Soul Society arc, our characters will explore uncharted territory and have fights of their own. Most of the fights will focus on presenting the personality and motivations of the characters and show off the world. It's the most well executed arc out of the entirety of Bleach, because there's a sense of urgency because you don't know how events will play out and it does pretty much feel like a rescue mission. But everything falls apart after this arc. Fillers with irrelevant events will start pilling up, which even the most thirsty of fans tend to skip. The fights just become a mess where the character who's strongest wins until the other character reveals a ""final form"". That will be the basic structure of all the fights for the series' remaining airtime and actual abilities and what they do won't matter, because ultimately, the strongest in raw power will win. All of the action of the series is stale and the character motivations just don't matter. Fuck, each character has different abilities and that plays so little into how fights go around, that they feel almost incompetently choreographed. They just seem to bank on pure hype alone. While Ichigo has an interesting execution at the start, he's a very standard shounen protagonist who fights to protect his friends from harm, he's hot headed, has spikey hair and is fucking terrified of those things women have on their chest or between their legs. He is an archetype that even at the time was treading water. All the other character don't matter since the series removes all the tension and urgency by making everyone make peace amongst themselves and just introduce some new enemies so a constant clash of I'M STRONGER THAN YOU DIE will come. The overarching villain of the series is some dude thirsty for power for the sake of power. Otherwise known as a cartoon villain. Everything in Bleach is as generic as possible. Bleach aired for 8 years. In these 8 years, the artstyle suffered some changes. From first having that choppy VHS aimed type animation with some degree of bad color balance it eventually ends up being one of those series that didn't figure out how to draw the outline of the characters without making them oversharpened, so everything is constantly looking blurry. Also the color balance often feels too strong when dark colors aren't involved. In the first few years it was introduced, it had some pretty interesting tracks that in all honesty, I can enjoy listening to these days. Then eventually transitioned to airing some harmonical/classical tracks in its wake. They're not bad, but the first aired tracks for the series have a very distinct feeling. So if you decide to watch Bleach do it if one of the following descriptions apply to you. You're just looking for a long running action series and don't really care about the structure of the fighting and think that the raw power type drawn fights will entertain you. Or you're looking to look into the way the business strategy of selling off the next Dragon Ball failed and Bleach is a particularly strong choice because it's already kinda faded out of relevance. It doesn't really have really strong action and early it mostly was used to develop characters. Then it was just colored blasts or final forms. Or both. The humor is slapstick and well... you can find that type of humor pretty much anywhere. No need to find it in Bleach. And Bleach just is a very generic show that aired for a really long time. Ultimately, Bleach was passed off as milk. But most people know better than to drink Bleach.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 12, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_114bcf6604,1
"Bleach, Bleach, Bleach. It has alot of popularity, and for reasons I don't know because I find it awful. I have given Bleach a lot of chances and I think I have seen enough of Bleach to give a review. ==STORY== One of Bleach's many bad points is its story, it's about as typical as a story gets. The premise is basically 'save the girl' and 'beat the strong people'. That is it, often running into huge monsters that never really seem like much competition. The story never improves, every arc starts the same. Ichigo in school hanging around with his horribly annoying, useless friends, then a new enemy will show up, capture someone or blow up something, then it is up to Ichigo to save the day. This process isn't quick either. One fight would be 4-6 episodes of struggle before something actually develops, and thus leads to many hours of boredom. But from the Soul Society Arc to the Arrancar Arc, Bleach never excels, it's stuck in one spot it can't seem to get out of. ==CHARACTERS== Oh God, something actually worse than the story. Characters, let's start with our protagonist Ichigo, I'd say he is about as interesting as a wooden post. I didn't realise main characters can lack such depth, but it's possible, Ichigo is a character that never develops, his personality, his relationships. The only thing that Ichigo actually improves in the whole series is his strength, but everything else tends to remain the same. We are left with a very boring, serious character, surrounded by several really happy characters. His school friends are very annoying, Inoue seems to follow too deep into the cliche, ""damsel in distress"" because that is basically all she provides, often his other friends will try to join in on the action and get beat up. Ishida starts out as a potential threat to Ichigo, then ends up far behind, Chad is big... and this soon becomes natural, the unimportant classmates, (Keigo and the Lesbian in particular) will provide moments of forced humour, to the point where you would want to repeatedly hit yourself with a lead pipe. Then you'll have the 13 division captains and lieutenants. Basically just a horde of characters, in fact, too many characters that will get about 1 or 2 fight scenes then become unimportant to the rest of the story. The antagonists are either extremely insane or extremely moody and that is all you get, I tried to analyse deeper into the supporting characters, but then I realised the characters aren't deep enough to delve into, what you see is what you get. ==ART + ANIMATION== Well backgrounds aren't exactly awful. They provide with fairly decent backdrops. Sometimes you'll wonder where all of the people are but while not anything special backgrounds are colourful and scenery contrasts well. Art is very inconsistent for the most part. Good episode, rushed the next. You don't know what you are going to get and it becomes really unpredictable. Character designs, not so good. Sometimes you'll wonder if a 5 year old designed some of the characters because they tend to be very different looking. Some characters will look incredibly standard, and others odd, the inclusion of a hollow hole for me is unnecessary because it just adds to the strange character designs for most hollows and arrancar, just a huge, randomly-placed, gaping hole going through their bodies. Reason? I have no idea. Just to add to the stupidness maybe. Well, they are about as strange as their choices of names and fanservice is extremely common, just about every woman other than Rukia has massive breasts, I think its just a ploy to make most of the women memorable since they seem to lack character. Rukia is perhaps is the only female in the series with any character. Animation is not fantastic, you'll find yourself laughing at most running motions. Fight scenes are incredibly boring, it feels like the animators took every shortcut they could to make the fights easier to animate, movements of characters are far too static and stiff, I would like the characters to loosen up and fight properly but in the end it gets repetitive to the point where it is unwatchable, and all they tend to do is bash swords together for several episodes, using energy blasts and flying into eachother at high speeds. Yes, it's DBZ with swords, the only thing is DBZ managed to pull those fight scenes off and make them interesting. The main problem with the fight scenes is that there is no fluidity, no originality, everybody has the same thing: Sword strike and energy blast. But most importantly it is the lack of style that ruins it, it's like no one has freedom when they fight. Since most of Bleach is fighting, I judge most animations on the fights which is perhaps the biggest disappointment I get when watching Bleach, as I am a big fan of well choreographed fights in animation. ==SOUND== The sound in Bleach succeeds a lot of the time. OPs and EDs are good, you can see the standard of music for Bleach is high, as people are usually disappointed when a series changes OPs and EDs, but with Bleach the current OP is usually just as good as the previous. Background music also fits very nicely, it is actually Bleach's strong point, the music is very refreshing. And usually suits moments. The only problem is that after a while you will hear the same songs, this isn't much of a problem but you can tell after a while the music variety starts to become limited. Voice acting is standard, sub and dub. ==CONCLUSION== Bleach is just an overhyped shonen. Most of the time I sit there watching, incredibly bored, the series never really goes anywhere, the pacing is really bad, things tend to take too long, fights drag on. The series has been running for too long. There are too many fillers, too many characters, not enough development, I don't care enough for the characters. It's boring conversation followed by boring battle every episode. After the Soul Society Arc I thought I'd give up on Bleach until a better Arc comes out, when the Arrancar Arc came out I was excited thinking that Bleach would finally excel to heights I'd expect. But it was all a big disappointment, I am now in the Shinigami v Arrancar Arc and so far I have been wasting my time and I am ready to give it all up. Basically, it is a modern, lackluster DBZ laden with huge swords, uninteresting characters and fanservice. I feel, when watching Bleach I am just missing out on better series'. I don't just want to flame Bleach because it is overhyped, but I really don't think Bleach has any of the qualities that make anime good. Overall, I really wish it was better",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 31, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6d59f29c84,1
"One of the most mediocre animes I've watched. Episode 311 was my limit. I have no clue why I'm still watching this anime other than the fact that I can procrastinate a good 22mins every week, this week was, however, exceptionally frustrating. The storyline is decent, but constantly revolves around the I'm-going-to-whack-you-until-you-die-so-that-I-can-protect-some-people-that-arent-even-going-to-be-hurt-by-you, oh I forgot that they spend no time trying to solve any conflicts peacefully, they just get straight into drawing their sword, and dueling it out with as LITTLE effort as possible? Why? Because, they will put in a little more effort the next week, and just a little more effort the week after, before deciding that I'm-going-to-take-you-down-now-with-my-super-ultimate... which will take another week before the fight is resolved. What an utter waste of time. Too predictable, and a total lie if anyone tells you there is characterization. The last 50 episodes has either been filler, or raw fighting. Ichigo continues to fight everything he sees and threaten everyone with his big sword without ever giving a care about resolving conflicts out of combat, same goes for almost every creature in the show. Initially the show was definitely enjoyable, what with the interesting idea of shinigami and their shikai+bankai... 311 episodes in, I'm sure few of us, other than the 12 year old kids will continue to enjoy this constant plot-less circle around karakura town. Where will the show go from here on? Well, I hope it ends, because surely there is NOTHING left to talk about? But golly me, I'm sure everyone will resurrect and powerup, just like they have been doing the past 311 episodes and it will not be a surprise if there is a ultimate-kai along the way which will then be countered by a super-ultimate-kai. What a waste of time, but I'll keep watching it, until it drops below the 5 I'm rating it now. Thank god shitty Naruto actually turned out better than I thought, as stubborn as Ichigo, but at least hes much more mature and likable than that violent criminal that is Ichigo.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e7adef9a01,1
"When I started watching Bleach, I couldn\'t get enough of it. Not only is it fun to watch but th storyline was fast moving and character exploration was something that I definitely looked forward to. I must admit, like Naruto, it has slowed down a lot and is just dragging for the sake of being on the air, but I still watch it every week. The protagonist of the story is Ichigo Kurosaki - who through some circumstance becomes a shinigami on earth. He is joined in the defense of earth from Aizen with his friends who have awoken their power through his influence. The trials and tribulations of friendship, honor, trust and loyalty is the underlying theme of the anime - very similar to Naruto. Simply put, it is a story of good versus evil and standing up for what you believe in.",9,Recommended,"Jul 13, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_86353caa11,1
"Story: 7/10 The story of Bleach is fantastic at times and dull at others. Episodes can you leave you at the edge of your seat, unable to stand the thought of having to wait till next week to see what happens next, or begging for current plot to end and to get to the next part where something interesting happens. (Especially if you read the manga in addition to watching the anime) When the story isn't filler it is usually exciting, fast paced, and with plenty of action and epic fight scenes. Unfortunately the filler is why the story loses points as none of it so far has been enjoyable to watch or added anything in terms of character development or exciting plot lines. While the plot isn't very unique, the old tried and true &quot;I must get stronger to save my friends&quot; routine, it does have some interesting plot twists that make it not as predictable as you would think and the conflict between the world of the Shinigami and the world of the Hollow and its impact on Earth, who is caught in the middle, is very fun to watch. Art: 8/10 The art is good compared to a lot of anime I have seen. Nothing groundbreaking but still pretty good. I've noticed a slight lapse in quality during some of the filler but that might just be my imagination. Sound: 9/10 Bleach has a few sound tracks that they reuse and are very well matched up with the mood of the scene. When Ichigo is getting smacked around by a bad guy it will play some dramatic, sinister music. When something sad is happening, it will play sad music. When Ichigo just had one of those &quot;I believe in myself&quot; moments where he unlocks some sort of hidden power in order to overcome a situation, the music reflects that beautifully as well. Character: 8/10 Some characters are extremely well developed and interesting while others exist for the sole purpose of showing off their large breasts. (coughMatsumodocough) Ichigo begins the show as a rather selfish, uncaring person who wants nothing to do with the Shinigami and we get to witness the change in him as he begins to place the welfare of others over his own. Eventually he meets plenty of other memorable characters that are hilarious or awesome in their own way while being mixed in with annoying characters that you wish would hurry up an die. The reason I began to love this show is because of the interaction between Rukia and Ichigo. Their conflicting personalities and the way they play off each other's sarcasm got me hooked on this show right at the start. There are a few other character pairs in this show who make me laugh every time they are together, such as Kenpachi and Yachiru, but none come close to Rukia and Ichigo. There is a little romance thrown in but nothing too deep. In short, you will come across quite a few memorable characters in this show that alone make it worth watching. Enjoyment: 9/10 I love watching Bleach. The fight scenes are great to watch and its a blast trying to predict what happens next and being surprised the following week. The only reason this part does not get a 10 is because of how bad the filler is. It is not fun to watch and leaves you desperate for it to get back to the real story. This show has made my Thursdays far more enjoyable. Overall: 8/10 All in all this is a show worth watching. If you like action then this is the show for you. If you like a unique and intricate plot then you might not enjoy it as much. The show has its good and its bad but the good far outweighs the bad in my opinion. It certainly isn't the best anime out there but it definitely holds a place among the front of the pack.",8,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9b383e3985,1
"Story: Bleach is a shounen anime and with that, people generally expect a decent story with interesting fights, unfortunetly, you don't get that with Bleach. The plot, or lack of one generally stays with the same formula throughout every arc. Ichigo gets a power-up, someone gets kidnapped, Ichigo gets depressed, Ichigo saves them, rinse and repeat. If that weren't bad enough, only bad guys die, while that may not be a problem for some people, the fact that a good guy cannot die really limits the amount of suspense a fight can have. It works for One Piece only because One Piece has a good story and characters that are developed well enough to carry the story. Bleach just doesn't have that. But some positives are that the fights are pretty decent, though there are a bit too many at times. Art: Studio Pierrot does the art and animation. Just like with Naruto, some episodes are hit or miss in terms of animation, though, they seem to do a better job with Bleach. Sound: The music is pretty good and fits the atmosphere of the anime. I also feel the music has gotten better through the series as it has gone along. Character: This is the area where Bleach could most improve. Kubo Tite did an amazing job with character designs and EVERY character looks simply awesome, but under their flashy exterior, is nothing. These characters, aside from Ichigo, Renji, and Rukia, are severly underdeveloped. They feel shallow and hollow. They are so forgettable, that I don't even know everyone's name, and I'm at episode 150. Enjoyment: I think you get a fair amount of enjoyment out of Bleach. It's far from a masterpiece, but it can be enjoyed, as long as you take it for what it is and accept the limitations placed on it by its creator. Overall: If you're a fan of shounen anime, watch Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter x Hunter, Rurouni Kenshin, and One Piece instead, though if you've already seen those, then Bleach would be a last alternative.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 2, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6c337c2455,1
"I have watched bleach before it became popular and I thought I should give my two sense. Story: Bleach\'s story is pretty straight forward, know the enemy beat up the enemy fight alot of people along the way. It does it pretty well but the one thing that I don\'t like is this animes fillers. They are terrible, I can no longer watch them. Bleach is a action anime and good story, nothing more. But for some reason the makers think they need to try and make it funny with the small filler story\'s. That is just wrong. Its like having a series setting and then throw a clown in the mix WTF! Anyways, that is not all that was wrong with the story. At some point and time they decide to make a huge filler arc and make it all action and your like YAY no stupid puns no dumb characters, but soon you realize and say to yourself \&quot;man this sucks pure action is pointless without a story\&quot; and like many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies you are wondering why you are watching this. (insert name) was good but this is crap. Well let me tell you most action flicks actualy have pretty good back story\'s and do carry them on through the show. And that is my problem with Bleach\'s story. Animation: Excellent characters, amazing backgrounds, just great animation. Sound: Pretty decent but not what I would say good, its music is very electronic and gets very repeated to much. Character\'s: Well despite a rather predictable main character who once again is the only one who can beat everyone, there are a lot of great secondary main characters. They have a lot more depth than Ichigo and are a lot cooler. Enjoyment: Even though all the negatives I have stated it is still very Enjoyable. When the real fights are done and over you will be wowed. Overall: Its a good anime, a lot of people like it and I think the reason is because the action is some of the best and even though Ichigo is kinda flat every other character seems to be more well though out.",8,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c1d0979acd,1
"Oh, Bleach. What a terrible story. I remember 2004, I was one of those stupid little kids who ""wanted to move to Japan to pursue an anime / manga career"" and felt the ""Japanese culture is kawaii ^___^"". So I'm on my computer, and I thought since I was loving Naruto that I would find another anime to watch. Well on a certain anime website, there was talks about 'Bleach', a popular manga story in Japan which has finally begun an anime on TV. Most people only decided to watch Bleach because Dattebayo started subbing it, but I got it right from the begining when LunarAnime was subbing it. Even when I was 14, I watched the first episode and didn't see what was so amazing about it, but I felt it had a 'cool' concept. Spikey haired stereotypical main character with a huge sword! What's not to love about that in anime when you're just a young teenager? Around episode 16 - 17 (I was having trouble watching this damn anime weekly because I was just bored out of my mind), the story begun to change and we headed into a new story arc. We learned new things and about where Rukia came from, etc. etc. And I felt the story was finally going to get good. Wrong. I was still bored. It felt like the story was going around in circles, over and over. Although the arc did have its fair share of enjoyable moments with some of the battles, it just didn't feel 'epic'. It's near the end of the arc, and Ichigo has finally got a new power up. It was bound to happen, since this IS a Shounen anime. And after 40 episodes of running around, they finally suceeded at what could have probably taken 10 episodes to do. AND THEN WE HAVE AROUND 50 EPISODES OF FILLER. FUN. And so, the current arc comes around and.. What is this? THIS IS JUST LIKE THE OTHER ARC! Only it involves masks and more energy beams. I dropped it after 132 episodes. I should have dropped it sooner, but I felt the show did have potential, but in the end it didn't reach it. The conclusion I have come to is that Kubo Tite (the creator and artist of Bleach) can draw very well, but when it comes to story telling, he fails miserabley. I wouldn't be surprised if he just made up the story as he goes along on the spot. My tip: give this anime / manga a miss and just watch something which is actually enjoyable. If it has to be Shounen, watch Hunter x Hunter or One Piece. I may have been brutal over this series, but it's just very overrated.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_809c82b2b7,1
"I remember when I first got into Bleach. Young, stupid, inexperienced with anime. For quite a while I thought I was enjoying a nice school life supernatural with a cute shinigami girl living in the main character's closet. It had so much potential to become something that had some plot, deepened characters and some actual drama in the mix. Then came the soul society arc and for a while I accepted it as a part of the series. Then it mutated into a cash cow. Throwing away all traces of deep plot and developed characters. completely ignoring it's secondary characters and focusing on many others, one by one, with slow paced fights that take episodes to complete. after having watched +300 there hasn't been a moment where I heatedly laugh or emotionally tear up. There is absolutely nothing presented on the emotional level. It's cheap themes and an overload of characters, keeping it's fat behind on airing slots week after week making sure it milks itself for everything it's worth. Then to explain the entire plot and the 'why' of the story the plot has the nerve to blame everything on Aizen. (not a spoiler, it's freaking obvious) Although I want to cry when a character dies, or want to take a small break from this pointless so called 'action' between shallow characters with no development, or deep rivalry, to have some true humor or romance in between. There are just simply too many characters and just too little time and effort into truly turning them into real important figures and entities in the anime. I'll give you a million dollars if you can name every attack, move, sword name, and character name in the anime. Seriously who gives a f*ck? This is the equivalent of a bottle formula for the young anime viewer and is a decent start point for anime. It serves as the bottom step to take you to the next and the next as you ascend to the greatness of anime such as, Evangellion, Code Geass, CLANNAD, or something like that. I've seen single OVAs do more than the total 300+ episodes that Bleach has done. Honestly, reading the manga is barely enough to keep my attention span. why stick around for the extended version littered with fillers and band promotional EDs and OPs? It's just a money maker for the studios.I hope Yuki Matsuoka is getting her fair share of fame and salary out of this. Seiyuus and animators gotta eat too.That's the only thing I have to thank for the people who still watch this anime...",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 16, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b9f7ec9ddb,1
"Ah good ol' Bleach, I started watching this when Naruto hit it's big filler phase and I fell in love with it. I suppose seeing as how this is a review I'll start out with what I love about the series. The characters are great with such a diverse range of people in the series, from the Captains of Gotei 13 to all of Ichigo's friends in his hometown; the series defienty has plenty of enjoyabe characters. The story itself, I think is great; I love animes that have to do with fighting supernatural being such as demons or ghosts or in this case Hollows. The series starts off a tad bit slow untill the first real arc begins in Soul Society, and from there I was hooked. The fight scenes are suberb and I love they shinigami weapons, called Zanpakutos and how they each have their own abilities and personalities. There is of course powered up forms reminiscent of plent of other shounen anime, but I actually like chaacters being able to turn into stronger forms. Ever since Dragonball Z's super saiyans; in the case of Bleach they release their swords, and then can go into Bankai form with some of the characters having even stronge forms. My only real gripe with this series is the fact that rarely anyone dies at all. Characters get stabbed, sliced, and put into near-death states but they always get healed or something, even villians. The villians are the only ones who seem able to actually die eventually, while all the good guys can get stabbed and whatever repeatedly and still fight like nothing happened. While this little gripe of mine does not deter from my overall enjoyment of the series, it can be a little annoying at times. They really need to allow some of the good guys to be killed, not main characters per-say, but atleast some of the secondary good guys every once in awhile just so we see they're not all invincible. All in all, I would easily reccommend this anime to any fans of action, or shounen in general because it is truly great.",9,Recommended,"Apr 28, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4f54da507d,1
"Bleach is an anime that revolves around the japanese concept of having an orange haired person as the main character. While Kurosaki Ichigo's hair is indeed the main part of the plot , there is also a sub plot. Ichigo can see ghosts while not being drunk , one day his sisters are being attacked by a Hollow (an ancient japanese clown) - here we meet a new character , Rukia , whom while starting off as a decent character becomes as worthless as Sakura from Naruto . Rukia's hair is black , thus making her a side character -she tells Ichigo she is a shinigami which implies wearing black puffy pyjamas while fighting off clowns (Hollows). Because of how worthless she is, she gets beaten up by the hollow , so Ichigo - taking advantage of the situation - steals her powers to become the main character and gain power the like of which , the world have never seen the like of which. So then he saves his insignificant sister , whose names are not important enough to be stated. For letting Ichigo steal her powers , Rukia is pursued by her loving brother , Byakuya - chan , who wants to kill her . Here is a summary of the most important characters : Ishida - Wears glasses while not looking like a nerd which enables him to kill hollows using magical powers and good looks. His grandfather's father past is revealed in flashbacks , but since no one watches those , we can assume he is a toilet cleaner. Renji - Has some strange ass tatoos on his face , and is stupider than the averages british which puts him slighty higher than animals. Like all characters that love Rukia he wants to capture her so she can be killed. His sword's spirit looks like a baboon with a snake for a tail , this shows how much shit a japanese guy can come up with. Ichigo's friend #1 and #2 - They are not relevant in any way but knowing the author we can suppose they could be the actual evil masterminds. Chad - A mexican bulldozer that reassembles a human being , he has a mexican hair and mexican accent but he is not mexican. He is dumb but kind , which is usually the worst combination for an anime character. His grandfather (everyone appears to have one of those) is dead , he calls him 'abuelo' which I assume means 'asshole' in mexican. Orihime Inoue - Even though her hair is worthy of a main character , she is regrettably a female which means she is not macho enough to be the main character. She therefore assumes the role of support character , all she does is run around , get kidnapped , shout other's people's names (Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! ), have lame monologues and provide fanservice. Aizen - He is the Deus Ex Makina of Bleach , he is like Stephen Hawkings meets Jesus Chritst meets Gandalf. He is the most overpowered character ever invented , not even Voldermort would challenge him to a duel. Also his ego is about 2 times the size of the bleach universe. In terms that can be understood by the average anime fans , he is the male version of Haruhi Suzumiya except he doesn't have ponytails (in public) and his SOS squad (or as he calls it - Espada) is made up of hipsters. Tite Kubo , the manga-ka of Bleach , loves doing 3 things: 1.Overpower Aizen 2,Make dissapointing characters 3.Extend flash backs to a ridiculous extent The fight sequences consists of unnecessary movements and awkward punchlines. Here is the formula to calculate the chances of winning in bleach: how loud they scream (db) * how many flashbacks they had + how close they are to the main character (note : if formula applied to Aizen divide by 0) Also if badass music is playing around , you can pretty much assume something is going to happen , so get your popcorn ready for the bitch slapping - unless the enemy is Aizen , in which case not even badass music iwill help. The music itself consists of the vast playlist which sounds very much like the youtube sensation : Keyboard Cat. Every single male character in bleach is gay , with the exception of Kon - the teddy bear. This means that love plots are nonexistent thus the lack of love triangles (and love parallelograms). Another concept used in bleach is F.L.A.B.F. , which stand for Fucking Long And Boring Fillers. By using the ancient japanese technique of having a 10 years old write the plot , the Bleach fillers make as much sense as any given youtube comment. The fillers feature an intricate story consisting of shouting , running and bitching outloud , new characters are introduced to see whether a character more annoying than Inoue can be created - of course such abomination wasn't conceived yet. Many conspiracy theories have arised with regard to the making of those fillers , some claiming that the bleach studios are just trying to find out how much shit fans are willing to go through just to see Aizen getting beaten up (or go to the skies with his father , Jesus , and his granpa - Haruhi Suzumiya). Overall the cake is delicious , but would you really eat it if the pancakes were kidnapped? It's like the story of the lonely napkin who forgot to go to work and lost his passport in a volcano after being chased by a flying rabid weasel across the globe , while being followed by CIA for stealing a coin from the desk of the person who's brother is egyptian - the same place where the pharaohs ate stuff which reassembled delicious sterilized carbon otakoxide which reacts with bleachium hydromoe. I hope you enjoyed my analysis of this intricate bullshit , and will help me in my quest to work out how drunk I am right now.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_985ce3ca4b,1
"Bleach really has a lot of ups and downs. While some parts of the anime are very catchy and enjoyable, others are incredible boring and make it hard to go on watching it. The very same goes to the plot of Bleach: There are some very interesting storyparts, as well as many plotholes and odds in the story (For example take a look at Soul Society - I'll never get why people grow up and die in a place they came to after they died on earth ...). The humour used in Bleach also has his ups and downs. Even though many jokes might not even scratch your lips, others will make you laugh hard enough to almost fall off your chair. The show always reaches his top when Ichigo is about to fight seriously, since those fight scenes are usually pretty cool, even though they are mostly kinda overdone. Bleach in general is a pretty enjoyable anime, especially the first few episodes are very entertaining and humorous. It's a shame it has some very boring story parts, many plotholes, many filler episodes and does not have much development in character relationships ... :(",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ec77a2e67d,1
"I can't take this show anymore. I tried, I really did, but there's so many negative aspects to Bleach that I just can't watch this uninspired, bloated, one-track show. This is a prime example of action shonen titles gone wrong. STORY: There WAS a story. Something that started off pretty good in fact, until Tite Kubo topped himself with the first Soul Society arc. This part was enjoyable, Ichigo and his friend on a mission to rescue Rukia. Simple, yet effective, something you would expect from a typical shonen series. However it becomes very clear that little thought went into how to follow this storyline. Like Dragonball Z, which I reviewed eariler, once this arc of the show is complete, the rest just feels like padding and filler. I know that most of it is filler and it's a constant recurring theme with a lot of manga/anime tranisitions, but Bleach has derailed from it's original concept so far, it makes me wonder why the hell some things are still happening. Why is Ichigo still a substitute Soul Reaper? How in the hell is he able to achieve bankai if he's still alive? Why not just launch an all out assault on Hueco Mundo if they have time to send random captains and squads to earth just to dick around for 20 episodes? I thought the premise of the story was defeating hollows, performing a seiru on lost souls, and sending them whatever happened to that? Instead, they make up new forms of hollows, then upgrading them to arrancars, them to espadas, and then vizereds! And don't forget about the OTHER forms of hollows called hashucehs, or whatever! FAIL!!! ART: The art is good and detailed, but it's easy to forget that these are supposed to be high shcool students. There are way too many soul reapers and their designs ranged from generic to just flat-out scary. It doesn't help that they all have the exact same uniform, despite different ranks and squads. There's lots of squad jargon in this, so when you hear Rangiku scream ""Hang on, members of squad five and seven will be there for back-up"", just translate that into ""some generic red-shirts will be there!"" The villans all look completely ridiculous, especially the released form of arrancars and espadas. They look like failed Pokemon critters made out of petrified egg noodles. But still the art is still decent and some of the atmosphere looks nice, the battle scenes are vibrant and action-packed, so it does pass on that scale, as it's knows it's fans like action. SOUND: The english dub of this show is incredibly grating. If I wasn't hearing Johnny Yong Bosch snarling ""You Bastard"" every time someone does anything short asking him what the time is, it's listening to the terribly dubbed voices of the horrible excuse of comic relief this this show has to offer. They actually manage to make these ""personalities"" even more unfunny then they really are. The soundtrack is passable, but leaves no real impression on any scene thats taking place, except for the ""wacky comedy music""(jazz hands) to let you know that it's okay to laugh at whats going on right now. This show just insults me with how stupid it thinks I really am that I need phoned-in, whimsical music to remind me that jokes are being told. Focus on making the scene funny first, then get back to me. CHARACTER: Oh, you want personality and character development? No, not in Bleach. All character development must be presented in exposition flashbacks in order to save time for the next fight scene. Despite the diversity of characters in this anime, the males and females have limited traits that define whos who. Most of the guys are either boorish, loud and obnoxious, and most of the women are shrill, abrasive, and annoying. And I have to say, of all the shonen main characters I've watched over the years, I can't think of one thats as poorly written as Ichigo Kurosaki. There's no real direction as to what this character is supposed to be. In the beginning, he's supposed to be a delinquent, I guess, but I never quite believed it. He wants to fight to defend people, but treats his friends like shit, especially other male characters, to the point where I stopped caring about him. He's just another macho, male, chauvanistic, power craving Z Fighter knockoff who turns into a whiny emo git the second a stronger bad guy punches him around a few times, and if anyone like Byakyua or Kenpachi shows up, he has to try his best to assert his male dominance like an old lion getting kicked out of the pride. FAIL!!!!!! ENJOYMENT: There's just way too many uncalled for fight scenes in Bleach to stay interested. And once you start getting into character's bankais, the stupidity is cranked to the 32nd power. Characters get new powers out of nowhere with little explanation how they aquired them, the villians are nothing more than brutish thugs with petty grudges and don't do much else, the Soul Society is about as organized and efficient as your local Blockbuster and serves no real purpose other than a lame platform for the latest villian assault on it, a good chunk of the comedy is unoriginal and unfunny (short people jokes, hormone-driven jokes etc.), and is it me, or is this the desolate, lifeless version of Japan in anime history? It's giving Ronin Warriors a run for it's money. OVERALL: I just don't have the patience to sit through another +200 episode shonen title. Maybe if there was some sort of structure, or direction, it's just not good enough to deserve to be this long. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should. But as long as it's marketable, Bleach, and titles alike will continue to go on and on, long past the point when it was fresh and different.

We can say a lot of things but in my opinion, what makes an anime legendary is that if you watch it again and again without getting bored, you crave for it when you got nothing else to watch, that makes a great anime. Bleach makes you feel that way. I've read the manga too and its a solid 10 points for me. (Minimum amount of spoilers? below) . . . This will be my most controversial opinion yet; Bleach is the most under-rated anime ever made with how popular it is. It has a %45 filler rate and suffers from a classic shounen main protagonist style which can be seen as a bad thing but the story itself is far away from boring. It evolves with every arc and it's really enjoyable. The art is great (Kudos to Kubo ! we love you man) and the sound, the ost's... In my opinion it has one of the best ost's that anime history ever seen. The sad ost's will be make you cry even after listening to them after 10 years and remembering all the things that happened. While i write this review im listening to bleach ost's in the background and it takes me back to my childhood, the good times when there is no hardships adulthood has, no covid just pure happiness and the joy of watching anime and laughing with friends. This is what a good anime needs. Lastly on the charachters, all charachters got their own personality and you can feel it while watching it. . . . Overall, Bleach is one of the greatest anime that has been made.",10,Recommended,"Aug 12, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1a8be6af9c,1
"I do not care what people on the internet say about Bleach. It is a total masterpiece and have wonderfull and epic episodes. I really hope that, they will adapt the final arc! It deserves to have a proper ending, it sad that the final arc has not been adapted to the anime. And the characters are awesome too. The animation is different and uniqe The voice actors for both the dub and sub are well chosen, they fit the characters perfectly It is one of my most favorite, if not my favortie anime. So yeah, that is my honest and true opinion of Bleach",10,Recommended,"Jan 24, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_70a26d929f,2
"I have been thinking of doing this review in the long time, and now I think it is time to do it, I have been the bleach fan for over 10 years and I am still going to be it until I died, for this I am going to tell about it, Bleach is my very first anime ever and I have watching many anime after that, but I couldn't find any similar anime as a bleach, bleach have something so special place in my heart, so I going to say what I am feeling about all of this though about bleach, For me bleach is the best manga and anime series of all time,(yes I know bleach have many fillers)(yes I know bleach when down after arrancar arc)(and yes I know the bleach ending was extremely rushed) but if you could take it on a side, bleach has been an unbelievable journey and adventure on every arc (including fillers) and the story is just a masterpiece, and the art is just amazing and wonderful in both manga and anime, Tite Kubo's art work is beautiful and amazing, never seen it on others manga series, I thinking Tite Kubo's working show us about everything, the story, the character, the soundtrack, everything of it, but the most important part he really show us is the power of human, as a very good example of Ichigo Kurosaki, ichigo has shows us the power of human in the reality, the strength, the pain, the emotional, the weakness, the protection, and the love, I see ichigo as my childhood hero of everything, he is not like the other character like, Goku, Naruto and Luffy, because those 3 have a goal in their life, ichigo doesn't have a goal, which is unlike from other character, but also ichigo doesn't wanna be the strongest in the world and he doesn't wanna be the best in the world, he just want something he can protect with and save people, he feels more like a real person than others or he is actually a human and the others doesn’t exist, but he's really goal is protect the people he love, he's goal is the way more humanity than the other 3. And the way ichigo is actually like real person is those moments, The way he's fighting against hollow ichigo, it is like he is fighting for himself, the hollow power ichigo had, is the weakness, the negative, the depressed, mental issues and the aggressive, the way ichigo fight for himself, the hollow power is ichigo biggest weakness, and he wants to surpass it with his human strength and his mentality, an another moment is when ichigo sacrificed his power against aizen, he wants ending the battle and save everyone, he sacrificed his power to protect everyone, and he actually did, he saved his friends and soul society, the soul society was he's enemies before, he became the hero of soul society, another moment the biggest one is when he said (the end of manga) what despair? because up till now, I've climbed up, kicked it in its teeth and... surpassed it over and over again just to make it to this very moment!! That is the biggest moment of entire bleach, think about it, when he got the power for the first time, he's have problem, he's have weakness, he couldn't control it, and he couldn't surpass it, when he said that line, it really shows us, how strong he become, how he's surpass of everything, how he overcome all weakness, and no matter how many times he lost, get injured, get aggressive, get depressed, he still wanna fight to the end, and it is not about he's power but about he's humanity, how he grow up to a teenager who doesn’t want the power at first and didn’t care about save the strangers, to the person who want to save many people as in possibly, since the first chapter to last chapter ichigo has growing up so much, about his character development, his personality, his mentality and his humanity, because I feeling every time when Ichigo is fighting, he fights for everyone, not just in anime world, but in our world as well, Ichigo and Bleach has shown us the happiness, the sadness, the emotional and the adventure, and I hope you can see as well, I started to watching bleach when I was 10 years old and now I am 23, I am still going to be bleach fan until I died ^^ I know bleach is not for everyone but I hope you are going to watch it one day And for the bleach fan out there I hope this review is something meaningful to you Bleach is the most important anime for me because bleach has learning me many things, and bleach is the series that changes my life to become manga and anime fan, and I am proud to be a bleach fan ^^ thank you Tite Kubo for create bleach and to change my life <3 ^^",10,Recommended,"Jul 26, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_27f5e8c20a,2
"Bleach, you were once considered by the anime community to be one of the greatest shows of all-time. Now you're considered one of the worst. Let me start out by saying, this was my gateway anime, and it's what got me actively into anime 4 years ago. Despite its flaws, I still love this series, but not as much as I used to for many reasons which I'll get to in a bit. Bleach is about a high school student named Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see the spirits of the dead, and later encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper (Or Shinigami as it is in the fansubs) who helps send the deeply departed to the Soul Society, and slays Hallows to do that as well. She later ends up having to give him her powers in order for him to protect his family. However this is a grave crime in the Soul Society, and Rukia is later taken back where she is waiting execution for her crime. Ichigo and his friends of course then go to save her, and later many in the Soul Society also find corruption, and conspiracies in their system. This is where Bleach was at its best, the Substitute arc (1-20) and the Soul Society arc (21-63) are what made Bleach so successful in the first place. You had such an action-packed story, with deep elements, and good character development. You could have almost considered the show a masterpiece with what took place in episodes 1-65. Then from there, it went downhill. The first of the filler arcs began, the Bount arc which personally I find to be the best out of all the filler arcs. Speaking of filler, about half the show is filler. This is all due to Tite Kubo's complete inability to pace, period. Manga readers know full well he doesn't know how to pace. He draws such large of panels, and puts in hardly dialogue (And backgrounds-""Backgrounds in my Bleach?""), it's no wonder why a single episode will cover 3-5 chapters, causing them to catch-up to the manga very often, leading to all that filler. Now back to where it went wrong, Bleach began to fall apart after the Soul Society arc beginning with the first filler arc, the Bount. The Bount arc did have its fair share of good points (Like going into the extermination of the Bounts, and what they had gone through because of the Soul Society), but it was a letdown at times due to the poor pacing (Yes, even filler had bad pacing, go figure...), plot holes, and the lack of explanations to certain things that need explaining. The other arcs later suffered from these same issues (and from a few Dues Ex Machinas), and the character department began to suffer as well. The arc that had the most issues was the infamous Hueco Mundo arc which dragged on and on, and is by far the longest arc in Bleach. This is where Bleach's success began to wane. The TV ratings became shit to the point later on it led to the show getting cancelled after the Fullbring arc, people were dropping this series left and right, it lost its ""Big 3"" status (Note: If you still believe Bleach is ""Big 3"", you're either ignorant or behind the times) and more. The characters of Bleach are what the fans love the most about the show. Many have such cheesy personalities, deep backstories, and the usual desire to protect someone. However one character that really stands out as being bad is Orihime. You cannot turn a blind eye to her. After the Soul Society arc, she becomes almost completely useless (The only use she really ends up having aside from that minor support for her friends is healing people), whines a lot (Ex: ""Kurosaki-kun!!!!!""-Oh look we ripped off InuYasha, not just YuYu Hakusho (Spirit detective) and Hunter x Hunter (Clan extermination, you being the only one left-Uryu-and wanting revenge against who did it)...) which is the reason why so many people cannot stand her), and has her development go completely backwards as she becomes a damsel in distress, and willingly no less. The others will suffer from the same issues at times. For example Ichigo changes as he realizes he's not able to really protect what he loves most, but then will go backwards back to where he was at times by being scared of his own power. He'll also keep being the blind idiot that'll charge towards every opponent without ever really thinking things through. Now's not to say the show doesn't have any good points after it goes downhill. For example, you still have the desire to protect, an intricate plot with Aizen and what he was planning to do with the Hogyoku, what does it mean to be human, and the issues of exterminating something you created. But with Bleach's many issues after the Soul Society arc, it fails to ever be as good as it once was. It's a shell of its former self. The storytelling issues just leave you scratching your head at times, causing you to not be as deeply involved with the show as you once were, the characters having messy development also causes the same issue, and more. This is where you find yourself not loving it as much as you did. The art and animation comes from Studio Pierrot, who does not do a very good job with what they do with production values, even today, but this is where they did it that best. The artwork looks rather nice, and it's not the typical art you'd find from your average Shonen. The animation can be awkward at times (Especially during fights, and running scenes), but it can be rather nice. The sound is just good, the characters have good voice actors (Both sub and dub), and the background music fits in with almost every scene, but some tracks leave much to be desired. Bleach in the end is a show that started out truly great, but later went downhill, and became a shell of what it once was. It's still very good (Barely, just barely), but not the near-masterpiece it once was.",8,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ad8be0bee3,2
"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything bragworthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsical of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbreat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to melliflous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and endign themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, desptie what Narutard, shonen haters or anyone else have said. It's pretty enjoyable despite its lacks and faults, mostly in thanks to its great cast. Overall 10 😎😎😎😂😂😂",10,Recommended,"Aug 1, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_55b66131a1,2
"So, Bleach. Or like we fans like to call it; Blah, Plotkai, The Troller's Guide to the Fandom, Rinse. Story: Bleach story is really big challenge to average guys brain. It's like big chess game full of free moves. You never know what is going to happen or which chessman is going to be moved next. Only tiny little thing on this chess game is that last movement was made back in 2002 like 9 years ago. After 9 years Kubo hasn't managed to move a single chessman to anywhere. Actually the story is really great. Too bad same things happens 42 times with different characters or with different power levels. After reading almost 500 chapters of the manga I can tell biggest plot twist is just behind 460 chapters when Rukia has new haircut. I know, I totally spoiled the whole thing. I've also heard 42 is the amount of seconds it took Kubo to write the story, too bad he didn't have enough time to come up with plot. Characters: Yes, there is a lot of those. Really great ones, like Inoue Orihime. Lets just say if Yagami Light knew her, her name would be written really quickly. Bleach has also made character development to whole new level; I didn't know it could be negative. Art: At the beginning, there was one. It was messy and reader didn't always get what was happening. So it got fix'd and turned into ""lines."" No ink is wasted anymore. You can really see how white those manga sides are before they are filled with things.. And after that too. Bleached, ha, I bet no-one has heard that before. In the anime it's just shit along the animation. But hey, it's still definitely the strongest part of this series. Enjoyment: Oh yes. If you see a guy who isn't moving anywhere but spinning at his place and says he is going home - that's quality entertainment. How about Bleach. Well, it's like that guy but all he does is say he is going home. After many years it gets little annoying. My score was 10 for long time after the start. After that it has keep coming down little by little just like the story has improved. It's now 3. I'm looking forward to the future. :) Suggestion list: Forks, yes forks. Those are fascinating.

"One problem I noticed is people giving notes based on what others have said, without saying what they thought of such a subject. With the animes the same things, of course there will always be someone who will hate something, there is no ''perfection''. To be honest the first 4 episodes made me drop the anime, but after reviewing dragon ball, I decided to give this one a chance. (It was anime that made me see the otakus differently). In the end I did not stop, I finished in 3 or 4 weeks or so. Well, knowing that, let's go to what I found. History NOTE: 10 Ichigo, (the protagonist) has the ability to see spirits. One night, he meets a reaper named Rukia, she is impressed by his ability to see her, but in the midst of it all, a Hollow appears an ugly and evil beast. She decides to transfer some of her power to him, and without Rukia knowing that Ichigo is badass the fight ends on time. Well, in the end, Ichigo took all her power, being a big problem for her, because no Shinigami/Reaper can hand over power to someone else. Good rest need not add, it's already a good summary ... Oh, in my view I really liked the added things, some bad fillers of course... but nothing that demerits the anime itself. Art NOTE: 10 The fights, my God! They're fantastic, and since I don't quite understand this, I'm going to give you the top score! The expressions weren't great, I think it's as much as I can get as someone who doesn't understand about anime art. Sound NOTE: 10 All openings, and endings. Amazing! Fantastic Japanese and Brazilian voice overs! (Very sad for the discontinuation of Brazilian voice acting) :( Characters NOTE: 10 Ichigo is my favorite character, I love everyone else, hard to tell who I hate... Entertainment NOTE: 10 Good for a large majority who love shounen, this anime must conquer. I, for one, love the style. And of course there's going to be people who ooper it, but then that's other talk. I hope you've been helpful in my analysis. Could it have been exaggeration I given a 10 at all? Well, that's just my opinion. :) Um problema que notei é as pessoas darem notas baseadas no que os outros falaram, sem dizer o que acharam de tal assunto. Com os animes as mesmas coisas, é claro que sempre vai ter alguém que vai odiar algo, não existe ''perfeição''. Pra ser sincero os 4 primeiros episódios me fizeram largar o anime, mas depois de rever dragon ball, eu resolvi dar uma chance para esse. (Foi o ANIME que me fez ver os otakus de maneira diferente). No final das contas eu não parei, terminei em 3 ou 4 semanas mais ou menos. Bom, sabendo disso vamos para o que ''eu achei''. História NOTA: 10 Ichigo, (o protagonista) tem a capacidade de ver espíritos. Em uma noite, ele se encontra com uma ceifadora chamada Rukia, ela se impressiona com a habilidade dele de vê-la, mas no meio disso tudo, aparece um Hollow um bicho feio e do mal. Ela resolve transferir um pouco de seu poder a ele, e sem Rukia saber que o Ichigo é fodão a luta acaba na hora. Bom, no final das contas, Ichigo pegou todo o poder dela, sendo um problemão pra ela, pois nenhum Shinigami/Ceifador pode entregar o poder para outra pessoa. Bom de resto não precisa acrescentar, já é um bom resumo... Ah, no meu ponto de vista gostei muito das coisas acrescentadas, alguns fillers ruins é claro... mas nada que desmereça o anime em si. Arte NOTA: 10 As lutas, meu deus! São fantásticas, e como não entendo direito disso vou dar a nota máxima! As expressões não eram grande coisas, acho que é o máximo que posso chegar como alguém que não entende sobre arte de animes. Som NOTA: 10 Todas as aberturas, e finais. Incríveis! Dublagens tanto japonesa, como brasileira fantásticas! (Muito triste pela descontinuação das dublagens brasileiras) :( Personagens NOTA: 10 Ichigo é meu personagem favorito, amo todos os outros, difícil dizer quem eu odeio... Entretenimento NOTA: 10 Bom para uma grande maioria que ama shounen, esse anime deve conquistar. Eu, por exemplo amo o estilo. E claro que vai ter gente odiando, mas aí já é outros papo. Espero que tenha sido útil á minha analise. Pode ter sido exagero eu dado nota 10 em tudo? Bom, isso é apenas minha opinião. :) Translation done on bing, lazy to put into English.

Bleach is one of the best anime to ever exist. its a 10/10 people down play it because they dont understand the characters at all. most of them are sheep if you disagree just say your biased and explain.The first arc is one of the best new arcs with grand fish vs ichigo coward vs pride. it also shows a lot of foreshadowing like the quincy symbol on ichigo bed and also ichigo absorbing more reistu which are all foreshadows. Then the SS arc shows the best of ichigo titainism vs byuakuya legalism. then the next arc which i think is the best arc which grimmjow vs ichigo shows nature vs nurture and also him accepting himself as a hollow in the fight which then he showed his full power because he wasent scared about what other people think. people are blind or the just dont really watch the show if they didnt know that and that isnt plot amour at all. Ulq vs ichigo is also not plot white told ichigo that and also chapter 217 is foreshadowing his hollow in the fight. it shows how ulq starts to realize what a heart is and he starts to value human life more and become non nihilistic while ichigo started to become nihilistic its a complete switch. Aizen vs Ichigo has a lot of stuff which one of the best is the religious part of the moon in Buddhism which aizen search for enlightenment and koyoka suigetsu translates to the moon then ichigo sword zangetsu translate to moon cuter showing him cutting down false enlightenment and aizen goal was to dethrone the soul king (god) and ichigo being ever race soul reaper hollow full bringer and quincy is him being closest to the soul king which aizen wanted to be above then got cut down by him. Then the fullbringe arc which people think is just some arc to give the mc there power back which it isnt ginjo represents alot of stuff which one of those is revenge on the corrupt soul society for manipulating and lying to him which also happened to ichigo with the soul society and he did that exact same thing showing his hypocrisy.Then it shows his titanism as he wants revenge to the soul society and wants revolt in their systemic oppression.This arc wasent some arc for ichigo to get his powerse this arc is shown what its like for him to not have any powers and it shows his savior complex alot and shows is hypocrisy. Ichigo vs ulq he shown not to want to kill him because its not noble or heroic and it doesnt mater to him but now he was pushed so fair he wanted to kill someone which is also showing his development in character.More and more into the show ichigo has became to realize that him and his sword are one which he didnt accept it. When ichigo is given his sword back when yhwach destroyed it he doesnt use bankai because he has realize what his sword has done and was grateful fpr what his sword has done. Yhwach is also represented by some people like jesus which him being son of god (soul king) and also being born in poor conditions like him not having his 5 senses and he was able to perform miracles which also sets up a dynamic between him and aizen (devil) which some are him stating the soul society belongs to him which in the bible it says that earth belongs to the devil. the arrow that was used to kill yhwach wasnt a bad ending and it was foreshadowed in 659 when he was cutting his wife open when she died of the Auswhalen.

"Bleach is an outstanding anime. From the moment you watch it, you're left wanting to know what happens next. The action is intense, and there is plenty of humor. I'm going to break down the scoring into the categories and elaborate on why it was given that score. Story: 9 The story is very gripping. It has many plot twists, and is full of surprises. Ichigo has been able to see ghosts since he was little. When a hollow comes (an evil spirit) a shinigami named Rukia shows up in Ichigo's room trying to figure out where it is. She is startled that Ichigo can see her, since normal humans can't. Annoyed by his attitude, she places a binding spell on him. The hollow shows up, and it's targeting Ichigo's family. This causes Ichigo to break the binding spell, who runs down to help his family, while Rukia is left shocked. As Ichigo is fighting the hollow, Rukia steps in and saves him, though she gets injured in the process. Ichigo, desperate to protect his family, has Rukia transfer her shinigami powers to him, but unexpectedly takes all of them instead of half. Ichigo eventually agrees to take Rukia's place for a while, and Rukia starts discovering that he's not an ordinary shinigami. Just what is he? Art: 10 The art is beautiful. The characters are drawn with defining styles, giving each character their own personality as soon as you see them. The battles are where the art really shines though. The weapons look awesome, some of which are swords, others are spirit bows. Lastly, the scenery is amazingly well drawn. Everything is very detailed and really stands out.

"Every couple of months my rating for this anime drops. A couple of years ago I thought this anime was awesome but now its just empty space. This anime is just a time waster. It has taken 310 episodes to complete the story (if it really is completed). That is simply way too long. This entire series is just a giant tease. The battles that are boring and involve no one particularly interesting last 5 episodes. And the really epic battles that the entire series builds up to last 1. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of filler. Also the story makes no sense whatsoever. There are so many illogical characters (hinamori!) and lose ends that I just threw my hands up and gave up. My advice is: 1. If you haven't already started watching this anime, wait 4-50 years for it to end so you can skip all of the filler episodes or just watch recap episodes. 2.

"When talking about BLEACH there's always a heated debate going on. People who have watched the show complain about many things, from the character development, to the matter of the fillers, to the lack of necessary explanation for certain events and lots more... I admit some to be legitimate, but there are some other issues that may be caused by various sorts of misunderstandings. For instance, some people complain about the numerous fillers that break the original story line; I rather think they are necessary, since a long run show like this needs to be split, otherwise it would be too much to handle. Fillers are fun (I said what I said ;)), and a great way to feel less overwhelmed by the heavy and thick plot. Obviously I am talking as someone who watched it during the last year all at once, people who watched it while it was airing have all reason to complain. Then since we are talking about a thick plot, it is true that some situations, events and systems are not well explained, as well as some characters' backgrounds, and it's kind of frustrating, because everything else is so great that you just miss that one little piece to make it perfect. Needless to say that this happens because there are just too many characters, too many stories, too many details squished in one single show. Thing is, it doesn't matter how annoyed you are by this chaotic system, you will fall in love with those details, that big bunch of characters, those complex arcs, ending up wanting those 366 episodes to never end; because basically, besides their abundance, all these features are iconic: amusing characters, no plot holes, A LOT OF PLOTWISTS, great fights, amazing soundtrack and themes and so on. BLEACH became quickly one of my favourites, despite not being flawless, it kept me in suspense, made me laugh, also cry sometimes, it always got me hoping to see more, and if it made me feel all that, it means that (at least to me) it is a piece of work worth of recognition.",10,Recommended,"Aug 15, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4cab2f458b,2
"Have the patients to watch this god tier anime, if you dont you wont enjoy it plain and simple. Its OST is one of the best in anime, fights are rewarding for the most part, art is awesome but i disliked how they changed the artstyle but that tends to happen after long time, story is unique and fun and easy to follow. All in all great anime for those who love shonen. Personally the dub is what made me love it but the sub seemed alright too. I rewatched it and skipped the filler the second time and i had a better experience the second time around, but there are at times where filler characters mix with canon which can be strange and annoying but not that much. There is only 1 scene where a filler character is added into a serious scene so you dont have to worry. All in all great anime and when i have the time i would love to rewatch it again",10,Recommended,"Mar 17, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c648c52c09,2
"Bleach is one of my favorite anime. The story in the anime is great. I have nothing to say about sound, perfection. In my opinion Bleach has the best artistic style of the big 3. The characters are very well designed, especially Aizen, Urahara and Ulquiorra. Urahara is my favorite character because he reminds me of me xD. Some characters have a hole in the story, the only thing I don't like is that. I enjoyed watching Bleach, the fights and everything else is great. I recommend Bleach to everyone who hasn't watched it, you can skip the fillers, although there are also good fillers. I can’t wait for the Thousand-Year Blood War arc to be animated, I hope it will be this year. Overall 10/10.",10,Recommended,"Jul 7, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2831f7c99b,2
"I feel like this anime should be boken up into different seasons or story arcs. The rating I gave if is for the animes original story arc. The first story arc (the Soul Society Story Arc) was the greatest anime experience of my entire life. The story is exciting, and envokes every emotion in the the viewer. The chracters are very well done and diverse. I found myself picking a new favorite character every few episodes! Bleach even has an awesome soundtrack! This portion of Bleach gets a 10 out of 10 hands down. Everything after the Soul Society Story Arc doesn't even compare. The filler is as bad, if not worse than the Naruto filler, and is very hard to get through. Within the filler there is the: Bount Story Arc, and then just a bunch of misselaneous eppisodes that are not connected in any way. The Bount Story Arc is not very good, and the miscelaneous filler that follows is unbearable. I would honestly rate this portion of the anime a 2 out of 10. The Espada Story Arc follows the filler, and is pretty good, however still does not impact you the way the first story arc did. It is very worth watching though, since there are some good battles and a variety of interesting new characters. The new characters are harder to identify with than the characters from the earlier story arc, However it is always fun to watch the anime's main characters continue to grow. All in all I would rate this portion of the anime about a 7.5 out of 10. After the Espada Story Arc, the anime moves into more filler, and after about 3 episodes I gave up on it. The important thing to take from this is that episodes aprox. 12 to 62 are amazing, and I would recomend everyone watch from episode 1 to 62. Hope this review is helpful :)",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e3f135495f,2
"This is my first review, so please forgive me for my errors. Where do I begin with this show huh? First off I want to start by saying that this show is damn near flawless. I say damn near flawless even though I'm giving this show a 10 excluding the fillers with some being an exception. This show is both a popular Shonen and at the same time I feel like it's criminally underrated. Me speaking as a massive bleach fan who's been drinking bleach for 2 years, like others we consider this show to be the worst of the big three. Ngl this show is my favorite of the big three Shinigami Arc, Some people like me consider this the worst arc in the bleach anime but I don't think this arc wasn't that bad. Ichigo is just your average teenage student school in high school born with a power to see ghosts. Rukia shows up and hands ichigo her soul reaper powers and Ichigo vows to protect his friends and family. Later on we get to know about the likes of uryu, orihime, and chad as the arc progresses. Rukia eventually forces herself to get captured by her childhood friend renji and her brother byakuya for the crimes of giving a human soul reaper abilities, and of course it's up to ichigo and his friends to save her from being executed after their training with kisuke. Soul Society Arc: Honestly as much as I kinda get annoyed this take that people like to say when it comes to this show, I do think that the Soul Society Arc is the best arc and one of the best arcs in Shonen. I say that because everytime I come across a take about this show, they say that ""Bleach falls off after soul society"" or ""Bleach takes a nosedive after the first 63 episodes."" I find those kind of takes very delusional. So during this arc, Ichigo learns how to maintain his soul reaper powers as he meets yoruichi and makes contact with his sword spirit zangetsu. The karakura gang rushes to the Soul society on their way to save rukia. In order to do that, they must encounter countless shinigami including the captains and lieutenants. A huge plot twist gets revealed during this arc that no one expected was gonna happen. Arrancar Arc: Like I said I find this take delusional as I see many people even on this site say this show falls off after ichigo saves rukia. I do kind of see it but I still disagree nonetheless. If you want to say because of the fillers ruin the pacing of this show then sure. LIsten no one is forcing you to watch the garbage known as the bount and the new captain arc. I'll admit I did make the mistake of watching those bs fillers myself thinking they were canon because I personally never heard of fillers. That's my only bad thing I'll say about this show. However I do think the second half of the filler arcs are better and even the animation I found to way better most of the time than the mainline story arcs as crazy as that sounds. We start off the arc with ichigo and friends returning to their high school days until ichigo encounters with shinji, who just like ichigo is a soul reaper has a strange hollow mask that grants him hollow powers. Shinji wants ichigo to join his vizard crew to train him on how to master his hollow powers. After that we get introduced to these new level of hollows called arrancars, who are basically hollows that look like humans and they also have swords. So pretty much they're soul reaper captain level. As the arc goes on Ichigo learns to control his hollow powers as he continues to fight to save his friends. Fullbring Arc: This arc is very controversial because of it taking place after ichigo defeats Aizen, the main antagonist of Bleach and people consider it canon filler. Personally while it isn't one pf my favorite arcs in the show, I still enjoyed it nonetheless. After ichigo loses his soul reaper powers from his battle with aizen, he spends his normal life as a high school student as a full year flows by. Out of nowhere a fullbringer name ginjo see ichigo and tells him that he'll be able to get his powers back if he joins his crew of fullbrings, who are basically regular humans who uses normal objects to release out their soul abilities. Conclusion: This is honestly my second favorite anime of all time behind dragon ball (mainly Z). Tite Kubo's character art style is my favorite of any anime I've seen. The art style in the manga is better but the anime version is still great. I will do a review on the first and second cour of the new thousand year blood war anime. Like I said it's not a perfect show despite me giving it a high score but my biggest reason of liking the hell out of this show is because of it's drip and it's fights. I do like the story as well. Kubo is known to have the most sauciest characters in anime. I will forever drink bleach until the ends of the earth.",10,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7f8b1b288,2
"During the 2000s there were three anime that stood tall above the rest at that time. The anime that brought an entire generation of anime watchers into anime. Of course, I am referring to the big three: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. While I personally got into anime through other means, Bleach still means a lot to me as a series. I have so much nostalgia looking back on it, that it's hard to imagine life without watching the series. So now, let's get this review on. Characters: Bleach characters are always interesting to talk about, because there's just so many of them. That can be seen as a flaw, because sometimes too many characters can cause it to become cluttered and then the story becomes hard to follow, or the characters lack any sense of depth. That being said, I think Bleach pulls it off. Every character has distinct personalities, and almost every character has well thought out connections with someone else throughout the story, whether important to the plot or not. Take Rangiku, a character that is basically just in the background, and is seen as a simple big titty anime girl. She actually has a vital connection to one of the most important characters during a specific arc. That just goes to show how much time and thought was put into the characters. As a main character, Ichigo is that guy. He's the man who shows up, ready to have your damn back in any situation. His transformations are some of the best shounen has to offer, and his characterization and self-discovery journey are beautiful. His relationship with all of his friends, especially Rukia, are dynamic and interesting. There is so much to talk about with the characters, but I'd like to keep it spoiler free, so I'll stop there. Soundtrack: Shiro Sagisu knows how to write music. The Bleach soundtrack is my favorite in anime, no questions asked. Tracks like: Treachery, Number One, Shinji's Theme, La Espada, Never Meant to Belong, Stay with me, and so so many more go so hard. Animation: Considering how old it is, the animation can get choppy at times, however it's not unappealing to look at by any means. That being said, it could be better. Overall: I didn't talk about too much because I didn't want to get into spoilers, however I have to recommend it to anyone willing to skip filler. (Please don't watch the filler, it's really fucking bad). The story is actually really well thought out, and it's worth the watch.",9,Recommended,"Oct 23, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fe1ad9b1f1,2
"This anim&eacute; would easily be a 10 if the plot were condensed into between 1/2 and 2/3 of the episodes. The Bounto arc wasn't even present in the manga and is not generally worth watching/doesn't affect character development either. (I think that's around episode 70-100 or so) This anim&eacute; is not bad to watch many episodes of back-to-back because you don't notice the stretched out pacing of it as much, watching weekly is almost tortuous, especially when there are random 2-3 week breaks once in a while. I'd almost recommend for anyone wanting to keep up-to-date, but who hates slow paced stuff to just watch groups of 2 months worth of episodes at a time, or something like that. Yeah, it's your typical fight anim&eacute; and it can drag on, but you'll never get anything as bad as the Frieza Saga IMO. ;)",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_02b599758a,2
"First time I watched Bleach was when I was a kid. I thought the Agent of the Shinigami Arc & the Soul Society Arc were great but when I got to the horribly boring Bount Arc it was soo boring that I droped the anime. When 2020 came I decided to revisit my childhood animes. I rewatched Naruto, Fairy Tail, Doraemon, Shinchan, Perman & Bleach. I was still a newbie back then and didn't know about filler. I again droped Bleach because of the bount arc. Then again in early 2023 for the 3rd & last time I decided to watch Bleach but this time I knew what filler was so I skipped the bount arc and went straight to the Arrancar Saga and it was a masterpiece. Then I watched the The Lost Substitute Shinigami Arc which was also great. afterwards I watched The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc Part 1 and it was great. After taking the story telling, the plot twist, the arcs, the action, the comedy, the art, the side characters, the protagonist, the antagonists, the duogonist & the world building into concideration I rated it a 9.7 out 0f 10. It's my favorite anime (after Steins;Gate which is a 10 out of 10 Ofcourse) for all this reasons.

"Ah yes, I finally got around to finishing off Bleach. Man, this animé was a wild ride, let me tell you. I'll give a review on each of the characteristics I found in Bleach below for anyone interested. → Story: The story starts off with a young high-schooler named Ichigo Kurosaki who is gifted with the ability to see ghosts, spirits, and the like. One day, his family is attacked by something known as a Hollow, which are essentially evil spirits that try to consume human souls. He is then saved by Rukia Kuchiki, the tsundere Soul Reaper, which are essentially spirit hunters that try to purify Hollows to enter the Seiretei (basically heaven). Having been brutally injured in battle, Rukia asks Ichigo to take over for her and become a Soul Reaper himself, which Ichigo accepts, to then protect his family and friends. The story goes on like that for a while, with it having one of the best arcs ever, the Soul Society arc. In this arc, Ichigo and friends try to rescue Rukia, who is slated to be executed for donating her powers to Ichigo. Here, Ichigo and friends must fight through a hoard of Captain-class Soul Reapers that are impeding their rescue operation to get to Rukia, after which the plot thickens, traitors are uncovered, and the story escalates into something far more sinister as friends turn out to be enemies and enemies turn out to be friends? You never know who you can trust and who you can't, which is something Bleach did a phenomenal job of doing. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. The only issue with the story portion of Bleach was its vast amount of filler episodes, but you can easily skip over those if you don't want to watch them. Otherwise, the story was very strong and I enjoyed all of it. I won't dock points for filler episodes, so the story of Bleach is a solid 10 out of 10. → Characters: Bleach has a phenomenal roster of characters. Some of them are annoying (Keigo Asano, Orihime Inoue, Hiyori Sarugaki, etc) while others are good (Shunsui Kyoraku, Jushiro Ukitake, Kisuke Urahara, etc). Bleach has no shortage of characters so you're bound to find someone you like or resonate the most with. The only issue is that Ichigo's friends kind of become too weak to do anything in battle as the series progresses (rip Uryu Ishida), but I guess that's standard for a shonen animé, where they have to make the main character (Ichigo) overpowered to where the other cast can't compete. I give Bleach's characters a solid 10 out of 10. → Art and Animation: I think the animators did great for the animations and fight scenes. The Bankai that we're shown are also very well done and executed. In addition, you're always seeing a different background, be it daytime or nighttime. The scenery is always different with every episode, plus the characters were very well-drawn and well animated. Easily a 10 out of 10 here. I had no issues with the art or animation, honestly. → Sound and Music: Bleach has some killer openings and I have most of them on my playlist, but that aside, the music that plays during each tense moment, or battle, really has you on pins and needles as to what you expect to happen next. It really can give you chills and goosebumps at times and I think that's where the music is best, where it helps you essentially feel like you're in the Bleach universe. Bleach's music is honestly fire and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're missing out if you haven't. The sound and music are also an easy 10 out of 10 for me. → Conclusion: Overall, I think Bleach is a really solid animé. Granted, there's some annoying characters included in it but it didn't take away from the fact that the animé in general was still a good watch and made me want to keep coming back for more with the conclusion of each episode. I can't wait to start binging the Thousand Year Blood War arc and I'm just waiting for that arc to become fully dubbed because of how good Bleach was. If you're looking for a Shonen anime to watch and you're not sure what to watch, I do recommend picking up Bleach if you haven't already. It's one of the ""Big Three"" for a reason next to Naruto and One Piece and I stand by that decision. I rate Bleach a solid 10 out of 10 animé in the end.",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_04448e2859,3
"Bleach is a amazing story about boy and the many friends and enemies he makes along the way. This anime has action, adventure, and comedy all merged into one to make it worth watching. When I first watched Bleach I was pulled into it by the area of supernatural that surrounded it. Another reason why I like Bleach so much is that the characters were admirable especially Ichigo Kurosaki. His determination was inspiring and had me coming back for more not to mention the great deal of sword fighting that went along with it. The music, and art were outstanding its not too sketchy and overall its easy on the eyes. The music has nice rhythms and has you wanting to sing along, Bleach has also been compared to Naruto and in my opinion its Naruto's equal as a anime, so if you like sword fighting, super natural, and action, as well adventure this anime is for you!",10,Recommended,"Apr 13, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_234b355a38,3
"Don't let that question mark fool you like it did me, this anime is well over a hundred episodes long. At first I thought, ""Hey this seems to be around 13 episodes long due to it being episodic."" Boy was I wrong. This show drags out in a way that makes you sick inside. As it goes further in, it makes less and less sense. The main character Ichigo, loses a fight. So he powers up, has another sword fight and wins. Which I think is the plot to DBZ, just without the swords. It's beyond me how any of these characters retain their mental sanity. If I was pulled into another dimension where I have to fight endless amounts of zombies, (they aren't alive so technically they are zombies) I'd start freaking out. The more he fights the more dull it feels, like it loses it's meaning. So they took your girlfirend who lives in your closet for a month, that's no reason to go to the depths of hell to stop them from killing her. Like what? But it never stops getting weird and awkward. In my opinion it's in your best interest, just don't watch this anime. I'm only trying to help you out.

"Title: Bleach - A Shonen Epic Blending Battles, Redemption, and Identity Rating: 9/10 Introduction: ""Bleach"" has long held its place as a quintessential entry in the world of shonen anime. Based on Tite Kubo's celebrated manga, it seamlessly intertwines high-stakes battles, intricate world-building, and compelling character development, all wrapped within a narrative brimming with themes of redemption, identity, and friendship. As an ardent anime enthusiast, I offer an in-depth review of ""Bleach,"" demonstrating why it undeniably merits a solid 9/10 rating. Engaging Storyline and World-Building: At the core of ""Bleach"" is a narrative that seamlessly fuses captivating storytelling with world-building. It commences with Ichigo Kurosaki, an ordinary teenager whose life takes a dramatic turn when he gains the abilities of a Soul Reaper, a celestial being entrusted with preserving the balance between the living and the afterlife. His odyssey, which transcends realms encompassing the living world, the Soul Society, and Hueco Mundo, unfurls a rich tapestry of supernatural battles, mysteries, and profound revelations. The world-building in ""Bleach"" is nothing short of exemplary. It ensnares the viewer in a dynamic universe where the lines demarcating the human and spirit worlds become increasingly blurred, opening up boundless opportunities for storytelling. Each arc of the series brings a new facet of this multifaceted world to the forefront, deepening our understanding of its intricacies and magic. Diverse and Memorable Characters: A distinguishing hallmark of ""Bleach"" is its extensive and unforgettable roster of characters. Ichigo Kurosaki, the protagonist, embarks on a journey of extraordinary growth, evolving from an ordinary teenager into a formidable Soul Reaper. His character arc is punctuated by moments of introspection, unwavering determination, and self-discovery. Equally noteworthy are the vibrant supporting characters, each distinguished by their unique abilities, personalities, and intricate backstories. Renji Abarai, Rukia Kuchiki, Uryu Ishida, and a plethora of others contribute to the intricate narrative tapestry. Their diverse personas and emotional depth form an indelible impression on viewers, magnifying their emotional investment in the series. Themes of Redemption and Identity: ""Bleach"" plunges headlong into the profound and multifaceted themes of redemption and identity. Countless characters, including some of the most formidable adversaries, carry the weight of complex pasts and internal struggles that govern their actions. Ichigo Kurosaki's steadfast resolve to safeguard both the living and the departed mirrors an ardent quest for redemption. His internal conflicts, stemming from his own past and experiences, add depth to his character and challenge viewers to contemplate the complexities of human nature. In its exploration of the ramifications of one's actions, ""Bleach"" undertakes an unwavering examination of the possibility of securing forgiveness and the potential for self-redemption. These themes impart an additional layer of emotional depth to the numerous battles and character interactions throughout the series. Epic Battles and Spectacular Animation: ""Bleach"" has earned its reputation for delivering epic battles that are nothing short of spectacular. The intricately designed zanpakuto (spiritual weapons) and a broad spectrum of unique fighting styles contribute to exhilarating and visually impressive combat sequences. These encounters are not merely displays of raw power but opportunities to dive deeper into the characters' abilities and psyche. With each new battle, the characters exhibit substantial growth, which is a testament to the series' commitment to character development. Furthermore, the animation quality within ""Bleach"" remains consistently high throughout the series. The battles are choreographed to perfection, ensuring that the action scenes are both riveting and visually stunning. This consistent level of quality helps maintain the viewer's engagement and amplifies the emotional impact of the series' many climactic moments. Fluctuating Pacing and Filler Arcs: Despite its myriad strengths, ""Bleach"" does grapple with pacing issues, particularly in its anime adaptation. Extended battles and the inclusion of filler arcs, which were designed to allow the manga to progress further, can lead to segments of the series feeling sluggish and meandering. While the broader narrative remains compelling, these pacing issues can occasionally frustrate viewers who are eager for continuous plot development. Conclusion: ""Bleach"" is a shonen masterpiece, renowned for its dynamic narrative, intricate world-building, diverse characters, and profound thematic exploration. The series strikes a harmonious balance between heart-pounding battles and contemplative character development.

"Bleach is really my favorite shonen anime/manga of all time!(Along with Jojo, Hunter x Hunter and Jujutsu Kaisen of course). The characters are well written and the artstyle is very phenomenal. The story writing and world building is really great for a shonen anime/manga. And the other thing that fascinates me about this masterpiece is its fashion sense just like Jojo. The story is very unique and very unpredictable. The artstyle fits the story very much as it adds the atmosphere. The characters were very relatable as they had their flaws and strengths.

"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything brag worthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsically of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbeat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to miraculous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and ending themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, despite what Naruto fans, shonen haters or anyone else have said.

"Best. Anime. Ever. A high school boy gets drafted as a soul reaper, and devotes himself to getting stronger to protect his friends and family. Ichigo Kurosaki breaks the typical shounen mold of overly-optimistic lovable hero with something to prove, by being an ordinary teen with ordinary problems, faced with the weight of extraordinary responsibility: if he doesn’t win, people die. He is angsty, suffering, full of attitude, relatable, cool and badass, but loyal and heroic, and for those reasons, is extremely lovable - and these same qualities can be said of the show as a whole. Gorgeous artwork, amazing voice acting both in English and Japanese, and some of the best character designs I have ever seen across such a wide cast. It has the coolest, most fantastic (magic katana based) fights, set in worlds rich with atmosphere that is enhanced further still by 4 hours of original soundtrack. Bleach has style. It is funny, sexy, exciting, emotional, and deserving of the recognition it’s earned. You will watch this over and over again.",10,Recommended,"Aug 7, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7d834dc4b6,3

"I know People are not going to like this, but I do not like this series and I cannot rank this in any top 100 animes. Story Confusing and unexciting. I have a rule when I watch new anime, Watch the first 5-10 episodes, then make judgment, I watched 43 and I could not stand the story. It seemed as if the author didn't put much thought until it became popular. It didn't have much of a flow to me neither. It seemed as if they forced out things, like Naruto does, only this seemed more forced. Like when Ichigo fought that thing that had the face of his mother. It seemed very cliche. Art The animation is okay, but the characters, clothing and amongst other things doesn't strike me as anything original. Black robes, big boobs... The only thing I really liked was Chad and Rukia. The two appealing drawings in this anime. Sound Actually, the sound is good and the music is Appealing. The only thing I really liked from Bleach Characters Now some of the characters bother me. As I said, the only two original designs are Rukia and Chad. Both look great but the others are just... not too great. The characters in general, in terms of the series, are decent. I do like Ichigo, but he has moments when he seems very out of character. A lot of moments. It seems all the characters change a lot and little things like that strike me. x_x Overall, Didn't like it, and never going to finish this. I wish it was a little more thought out. I can't stand it.

"If you are about to watch bleach and are about to go watch the first few episodes, then your in for a treat. The first/introductory arc of bleach is an brilliant show of anime, truley somthing worth watching. But the problem in my eyes is that it goes very much down hill from there. Some fans (and myself) do believe it will pick up a little from time to time but ultimatly it is not going to wow you with complex or ingaging plot. As with alot of popular anime bleach very quickly gets lost in an unnessicary and almost unwatchably long train of fillers, drawn out fights and repetition on powers and jokes. Unless your new to anime or are caught in its fandom frenzy, then you will probably not beable to sit through the 100's of episodes to come. Story -6- as explained above it takes along time for anything to happen after the first arc. It does have a twists but nothing that will not become blatantly obvious. The fight scenes are not too bad, but most characters only posses about 2 or 3 moves, so it can get boring after their powers have been introduced. The plot lines do run for a while into the story but are usually summed up before starting a new set of events. There are alot of filler arcs that will literally come at any time they see fit, and will plague you with non-cannon storys, they are sometimes funny but generally are just in the way. Art -7- as such a long anime, the style and animation changes during the corse of the show. It is good in parts but is not consistent and is sometimes misleading to the actual abilities of a character. Sound -9- bleach has alot of different tracks related to it, both for the credits and show. When i look back on it, bleach fans are really spoilt for choice in this area. Characters -7- the characters are introduced well in bleach, and get some development, but not as much as you would expect in such a long series. Expect to be juggling names by the end though as it has alot of main and supporting characters (but hey at least their names are easy to remeber). Unfortuantly there will often be parts of this anime that will make you question where all the characters have gone though, as there are so many. Enjoyment -7- this is possibly the most subjective and overlapping category, but generally i would say that bleach does have a certian charm the will have you wanting more (even if you dont know why). I highly enjoyed the first arc and liked the manga that (imo) will make up for some of the problems of popular anime. But as ive said - you wont enjoy this unless you can strap yourself in for a long anime. Overall -6- im going to be fair, its good in places but has alot of faults. If i where you i would have a think about watching this series, and dont just dive in without knowing that you will be watching for a long time.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 23, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5ed32b9963,3
"The series shines in its characterization, with a diverse cast of well-developed characters, each with distinct personalities and motivations. Ichigo, the protagonist, is a relatable and engaging character, grappling with the responsibilities of his newfound powers while trying to maintain a normal life. Supporting characters such as Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Yasutora ""Chad"" Sado contribute to the show's emotional depth and provide unique perspectives on the unfolding events. Bleach's action sequences are one of its main draws, showcasing intense battles and spectacular displays of power. The series' unique combat system, centered around spiritual energy and various types of specialized weaponry, allows for diverse and creative fight scenes. The inventive abilities of the characters, particularly the Soul Reapers and their ""zanpakutō"" swords, provide a visually stunning and often strategic combat experience. The anime's art and animation are generally of high quality, with dynamic and fluid action sequences. The character designs are memorable and distinctive, reflecting Tite Kubo's distinct art style. The soundtrack, composed by Shiro Sagisu, effectively complements the series' tone, with iconic themes such as ""Number One"" and ""Stand Up Be Strong"" enhancing the overall viewing experience. However, Bleach is not without its flaws. The series suffers from pacing issues, particularly in its later arcs, and the inclusion of numerous filler episodes can disrupt the narrative flow. Some fans may also feel that certain plotlines and character arcs remain unresolved or underdeveloped by the end of the series. Despite these shortcomings, Bleach remains a classic shōnen anime that has left a lasting impact on the genre. With its compelling characters, thrilling action, and engaging supernatural elements, Bleach offers an unforgettable viewing experience that will resonate with both casual and dedicated fans of the medium.",9,Recommended,"Apr 18, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_63843a57a7,3
"Spanning 366 episodes, Bleach is regarded as one of the big shonen shows out there, sitting at the same table as One Piece, Naruto and Dragonball. Watching it in 2024, however, I can tell you that Bleach aged like milk. First of all, I could sit here and talk about fillers all day, but we've all seen the memes. Bleach is *at least* 45% filler, but even that is a generous number. If you remove all the useless shonen tropes like pointless flashbacks, repetitive shouts, long running scenes, still shots, slow camera panning and reused frames, you'll soon realize that Bleach is more like 70% filler. Bleach also has a serious issue with bystanders that *constantly* interrupt fights and serious moments so they can do their comedy routine. And it's not even good comedy. It's children's comedy. Manzai is a very popular (and exhausting) type of comedy where the ""funny man"" does goofy things while the ""straight man"" gets angry and reprimands them. Alright, now crank that up to the maximum, shove it in the middle of life-or-death situations, and make it as long and obnoxious as possible. That's Bleach's comedy. The thing is, Bleach knows how to create funny moments, but it does so at the worst possible times as the story progresses. Speaking of progress, that's one of the weird things about Bleach. Instead of getting better as the series goes on (like the other three big shonen series), Bleach does the opposite. One quick search and you'll see that the community generally agrees that Bleach was awesome in the first few arcs but had a drastic decline in quality and pacing as the story progressed. Even my friend who recommended it to me said that he skipped almost all of it. Putting Bleach on the same category as Dragonball, One Piece and Naruto is almost disrespectful. How can I recommend a series that only has one or two good arcs and then say: ""By the way, it gets really bad towards the end."" -- Minor Spoilers Ahead -- Another big issue that Bleach has are the power levels. The power levels are all over the place and it's not even funny. Ichigo always gets his ass kicked by every new enemy, only to be saved by someone he defeated previously. Now the person who is supposedly weaker than Ichigo proceeds to defeat the villain who is supposedly stronger than Ichigo. This happens because Bleach is a kid's show where the protagonist befriends all of his enemies, even the ones that do unspeakably evil things. No matter how edgy Bleach tries to be with its dark imagery, at the end of the day it's just a kid's show. The constant bickering in the middle of fights is no different than children fighting in the playground to decide who gets to be the Red Power Ranger, and in the end we see everyone holding hands and singing a song together. Bleach looks particularly ugly when you compare it to the flashy and action-packed modern shonen shows we've been getting recently, but it also looks ugly when you compare it to the other big shonen shows of the 2000s. The action, pacing, story and even the training arcs are completely messed up. Honestly, I basically just watched 366 episodes of a show I detest for the sole purpose of watching the sequel, which people say is really good. The sad thing about Bleach is that it had such a strong identity. The captains are cool as hell, the overall theme is unique, the setting had a lot of potential, and the Soul Society arc was amazingly good. I loved everything about Bleach at first. Hell, even the way the characters hold their swords when they're not fighting tells you something about their character. Even some of the lines that characters say are so powerful that they'll stick with you for a while. The creativity and attention to detail here was great, and I hate using the past tense here. Honestly, I don't even think that this is the case of a bad anime adaptation. For example, you've probably heard someone somewhere say: ""Bleach is good but the ending was kinda scuffed."" And no, it's not like a beloved character dies or anything. The ""ending"" is bad because the author decided to introduce the weirdest and most nonsensical magic system ever created. Everything that made Bleach great is suddenly replaced by elements that genuinely make you forget that you're watching Bleach. Hueco Mundo's arc was bad in terms of pacing and power levels, but the last arc is especially insulting. Bleach's antagonists stopped being cool and memorable after the Soul Society arc (save for a few exceptions), but the last arc manages to be even worse in that regard. We even get a discount Aizen that fails to capture even 1% of what made the original a good villain. In conclusion, I unfortunately can't recommend Bleach. It's simply not worth it. It doesn't hold up well today and only serves as an example of how to ruin something that had everything to be great. This review may sound overly negative, but it's just an honest warning.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 26, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a64d2b7c53,3
"Story-The first two and a half seasons were really entertaining, although painfully unoriginal. I hate to downrank the show so much as it was one of the main things that got me back into watching anime, but the storyline past ep 62ish is a complete and utter disaster. I'm not even sure how I stomached the full year of Bounto filler, and have recently dropped the series as there is yet again an entire arc of total nonsense that has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. Also the main story itself is plagued with repetition, the antagonists are nearly identical in personality (grimmjow=kenpachi, ulquiorra=byakuya) as the soul society arc and the situations are all exactly the same. My suggestion, watch this show to episode 65 and stop, you aren't missing anything past that. I would give the show 8/10 if it was only 65 episodes long. Art-Once again, started off excellent. I thought the first couple seasons had great animation, and the combat scenes were pretty well done. This area sadly however, seems to deteriorate along with the storyline, not quite as badly but compare the fights in seasons 1-3 to the ones after and the show just isn't showing us anything new. Sound-The music is ok, and it fits well. Repetitive sure, but it's a shounen with 180+ episodes how could the music not be repetitive. The sound quality overall isn't bad, my only complaint would be the op/end themes especially in season 3 and up. Character-The characters, like the story aren't very fresh, but they're well developed and pretty likable. The main downfall in my opinion is the overdevelopment of the enormous cast of worthless sidecharacters. It gets really bogged down with this at times, there is even an entire season dedicated to doing this (5th season). Enjoyment-First 3 seasons 9/10, rest 1/10. Starts out very addictive and fun to watch but trails on to &quot;why am I watching this.&quot;",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 8, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2b2ef254a8,3
"Bleach, the popular anime series based on Tite Kubo's manga, has captivated audiences worldwide with its unique blend of action, supernatural elements, and compelling character arcs. Spanning multiple seasons, Bleach offers a rich and expansive world filled with intriguing lore, intense battles, and a diverse cast of characters.

"The only reason Bleach is not considered the best of the Big 3 and the greatest Shōnen Anime of all time is the interspersed filler episodes in-between canon episodes and specifically the long stretch of filler episodes right after Soul Society arc between Episodes 64-108 which effectively killed any momentum the series had and put a massive strain on Bleach’s popularity. That’s it. Every time I hear critiques of the series; like the problematic power-scaling, underdeveloped side characters, or repetitive narrative formula, it’s all problems that exist in other Shōnen to FAR greater extent. Naruto has the most criminal waste of potential side characters in all of fiction. One Piece, which I love, has the exact same storyline formula for every single arc except maybe 2 or 3 (and that series goes on for literally thousands of episodes). Bleach has objectively the most well-developed main protagonist and antagonist out of the Big 3. Aizen is possibly the greatest villain in all Anime; Shōnen or Seinen (the only one that even comes close is Johan Liebert — but even then I’d argue Aizen is more compelling and terrifying because of his godlike supernatural abilities). Ichigo is a profoundly refreshing character in a sea of generic Shōnen MCs who all share the same goal: “to be the BEST _insert-title-here_” Ichigo just wants to live out a life where he redeems his most pivotal moment; that of losing his mother due to his supernatural abilities. His drive to rescue Rukia/Orihime originates from that insecurity; to not lose that love anymore, especially when it comes as a consequence of his own actions such as accidentally taking all of Rukia’s Soul Reaper ability which set in motion her planned execution. Bleach also has the best theming of any Anime I’ve ever seen. The whole Spanish ‘Day of the Dead’ aesthetic runs through every aspect of the series; from Shiro Sagisu’s godlike Spanish-inspired soundtrack, to the Hollow designs, to the worldbuilding etc. The soundtrack itself is by far the greatest of any Anime, with some of the best OPs in Anime history. And to top it all off… here’s Bleach’s greatest accomplishment when compared to almost every other long-running Anime: it actually has a good ending. Yes, the manga’s ending was rushed and trashed due to Shōnen Jump executives, but the Studio Pierrot Anime adaptation of the Thousand Year Blood War arc is absolutely GOATED. I don’t need to say any more. Bleach is the greatest Shōnen Anime of all time. The late, great Akira Toriyama didn’t go out of his way to personally give his blessing to Tite Kubo for nothing. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Feb 9, 2025",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_986d969d6c,3
"We are introduced to the world of Bleach though the experiences of Ichigo Kurosaki, a fifteen-year-old high school student who has great personal spirit energy and happens to be able to see spirits. As a result of what appears to be an accidental encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami or &quot;soul reaper&quot; (literally &quot;death god&quot;), during which she is seriously wounded trying to protect him from a hungry ghost known as a Hollow, Ichigo ends up with her borrowed Soul Reaper powers and her mandate to protect human beings from the Hollows which try to prey on them. In the meantime, Rukia herself is stranded in an artificial human body and joins Ichigo as a student in his class, limited to being a guide for him until her powers return. Later in the series, the spirit powers of two other students in Ichigo's school will also awaken as a direct result of personal encounters with the spirit world; while a third is discovered to be a secret warrior in the ongoing battle to protect humanity from the Hollows. However, the series takes great care to emphasise that the vast majority of people live their lives without ever realising that this other world exists all around them. While the Soul Reapers have tools which assist this continued lack of awareness, they are rarely needed. Until Rukia takes on her human body, no one except Ichigo is able to see her. Even when Hollows are at their most destructive, most human beings can't see, sometimes even refuse to see: and many, including Ichigo himself, try to come up with rational explanations for what they cannot understand until rationalisation is no longer possible. In the central mythos of Bleach, humans souls come to the Soul Society at death, to be reborn years or centuries later into the world of the living in a vast cosmic balance. Even Hollows are not so much killed as freed from their unhealthy attachment to a world of which they should no longer be a part. The purpose and duty of the Soul Reaper is to protect this cosmic balance at any cost. Emotional and other merely &quot;human&quot; considerations have no place in the Soul Reaper's samurai-like focus on duty, a parallel further emphasised by the outfit of the Soul Reaper and by the symbol and focus of the Soul Reaper's power, the spirit-sword, or zanpakuto. White, the undyed or bleached lack of all colour, is traditionally a symbol of death and mourning in eastern cultures; but it is also the colour of emptiness and thus of beginnings. In Pure Land Buddhism, white represents the Buddhist interrum paradise where souls are brought to help them achieve enlightenment, and from which a few enlightened souls will return to help other Buddhists arrive at the Pure Land. (Interestingly, later episodes in the series make it clear that Soul Reapers were themselves once human.) In many ways black, its polar opposite, is also its complement: death, yes, but also enlightened awareness sharing its knowledge, wisdom, and power while seeking to learn anew. In English, the words &quot;black&quot; and &quot;bleach&quot; even derive from the same root word. In the black and white world of the Soul Reapers, the orange-haired Ichigo continually inserts a jagged element of awkward humanity into Soul Reaper abstraction. Like so many other top-quality anime series, Bleach is adapted from a manga, or graphic story (comic book), which has been running in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine since 2001. While many manga-based anime soon run into the problem of getting ahead of the existing manga storyline, Bleach takes its time developing individual character storylines, and thus ends up with some of the best developed personalities in the entire field. Consequently this anime does demand a little more active work than most on the part of the viewer: but it is well worth the effort.",9,Recommended,"Sep 18, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ca11901937,3
"I've always thought that the big 3 were not so good, don't know why but they all seemed quite ok. Last year I decided to watch one of them, Bleach, and oh boy I'm so glad I did it. It is a battle shonen mainly focused on battles and powers but still manages to have an interesting story with well done characters. In particular what i loved about Bleach are the characters, while yes maybe some of them are kinds of stereotypes, others are really well written and appreciable. There are little to no plot holes and the events are not forced like it sometimes happens in other battle shonen. OSTs and openings are fantastic and the overall quality of the anime is good considering it's age. The only bad thing I have to say is that maybe there are a little bit too much fillers but you can skip them so it's not a big deal. The anime without fillers is around 178 episodes, all the films are not canon. My final consideration is that if you like battle shonen, definitely give a chance to bleach.

"This is my first review! ^^&quot; Where to begin? At first... this anime didn't catch my eye. I thought that it wasnt going to be worth my time on account of the story sounded a little... odd and off. But as I started to watch the anime more and more, I really began to fall in love with everything that this anime has to offer. ~STORY~ First things first, the story is very interesting. The first episode really caught my attention--and I wanted more. At time the story line can drag on, and I found it hard to watch, but the other parts of the anime really outweigh the bad parts. The plot has everything from your typical shonen funny moments to the serious and tense scences, to the little romantic moments here and there. ~ART~ The art... is very good for a shonen anime. Most of the time (as some can tell) shojo anime is usually drawn a little better that shonen, but I find that Bleach's animation is very good. Sometimes it can be a little inconsistant, but otherwise, I love it. ~SOUND~ Wow. The sound, everything is catchy. The opening and ending songs all are very catchy, and they relate to what is going on in the anime at that time. The background music really fits the different scenes, but to me sometimes they don't.... but they sound is still very good. ~CHARACTERS~ This anime probably has my favorite cast of characters. All of them are really lovable and you just can't say you hate them all. The characters don't look the same, as with some other anime. All of them have very different personalities and looks. Overall... the characters are probably the best part of this anime. ~ENJOYMENT~ Bleach is a very nice anime. I enjoy it a lot on account of how smooth everything is. I really do like it. ~OVERALL~ This anime is a must for all who like to watch anime.

"Bleach, From the very beginning of the Anime i totally enjoyed the story line it gave us to imagine. A simple student to be a death god is great. It really does sink into you and it draws out more and more excitement towards all aspects. This Anime isn't just about characters that stay the same throughout the whole series but people that evolve into things in-imaginable, the characters just keep adapting and it becomes more and more intense as the season goes on. The share brutality and inspirationally characteristics that characters have do inspire a lot of watchers as do myself, it even has a sensitive side that brings the fiction with the fact. i must conclude this by saying it is personally the top Anime i have watched and i hope it continues to grow not just on me but all the viewers who watch and enjoy it. 10/10 is my rating",10,Recommended,"Jan 9, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3e33d20c8e,3
"-First this is my first review so don&acute;t be too harsh on me. About Bleach: Story: (6-fair) The story isn&acute;t bad, it isn&acute;t perfect, but what really ruins the story is this two facts: first, the story has a damn slow progress, so you can see episodes where you simply watch half of a fight that isn&acute;t even one of the most important.Second is the fact that bleach has a lot of fillers ( i have nothing againts fillers, when they are good ones), and most of them are terrible and sometimes boring. But i can&acute;t give less than a 6, after all, the idea of the soul society and captains is quite good. Art: (6-fair) Art in bleach is not bad, but in my opinion could be better.. battles should be better, also caracther design is nothing special. Still, again, i can&acute;t give less than a 6 because there are some good ideias that makes the art not bad at all. Sound (6-fair) Sound is not a thing i give much value in anime, in fact i already saw great animes with terrible sound (in my opinion). But it&acute;s always better to have good sound and well synchronized with the story. However, i don&acute;t really like some openings, endings are not so great at all, and during the story is also not amazing, but it&acute;s at least aceptable so 6 fits quite well. Character (7-good) Character is for me one of the strongest points in bleach..i like the Shinigami hierarchy, especially some captains (like Zaraki Kenpachi, Hitsugaya, etc..). Also Bounto are not bad as well (i am still watching, but i have already formed and opinion). The main characters are good, but i don&acute;t really like orihime, some shinigami and the modified souls don&acute;t sound great to me, so only a 7, anyway, still great, cause i don&acute;t give high ratings so easily, it must be really almost perfect or have something special to deserve more. Enjoyment (7-good) Enjoyment? Well i can watch the episodes without getting to sleep or disconect myself..so i can say i like to watch bleach, however, there are some lame parts, some boring parts that could be avoided..but in the other way abillities and fights, and even some comic scenes, sound good, yeah i also like to laugh, but some character abillities really catch my attention so 7 sounds quite good for enjoyment. Overall (7-good) you may ask, i gave more 6 than 7s, why a 7 in overall? Well, the fact is that bleach is quite a good anime to watch, it hasn&acute;t something special to me, but it&acute;s like a balanced one, it focus a little in all aspects, so it makes easier to get the attention and after all it&acute;s one of the most famous anime nowadays, that&acute;s why.",7,Recommended,"Dec 10, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_99910f6b03,3
"Bleach -- one of the top dogs of shonen anime. And I'm going to say this right now -- Bleach is probably my favorite anime. I've cosplayed it, I've cleaned it/fansub'd it, and hell, I even wrote a 4000 word essay on the structure of the story. It's a very large and compelling anime...just with a lot of drawbacks. Story -- 7 The story of Bleach is long, complex*, and colorful, to say the least. It has a gripping plotline(for the beginning anyway), and can manage to interest anyone for at least a little while. Its filler arcs aren't so bad (see: Naruto fillers) to bring tears to the eyes, but they aren't exactly as entertaining as the normal story. The impression I got when I first started watching Bleach was that the author, Tite Kubo, had no idea what he was doing. It was sort of like an idea popped into his head, he drew it (it was then animated later) and that became the story. This doesn't lead to a bad storyline.The story, in my opinion, is very good, developed, and complex. However, because of the issue listed above, there are several plot holes due to the fact his ideas came spontaneously. One such being that shinigami, in the first few arcs, are unable to fly (this is reinforced by the fact Ichigo, the main character, has to steal a pair of wings to move quickly around Soul Society). About halfway through, however, all spirits suddenly gained the capability to fly, negating the whole thing about Ichigo having to steal wings. This change is worked in subtly, and I didn't even notice for a while. However, contradictions like this are present in the story of Bleach. And while it doesn't ruin the story, it does detract from the overall experience. However, the story does start to degrade somewhat after the first main story arc ends (ie. when Rukia is saved). It jumps from filler to story randomly throughout the remaining episodes to allow the manga to get a further headstart; the main story arcs are not too bad, but they never reach the full potential that was shown in the first. *Edited in note: I had referred to the story of Bleach as ""complex."" I wanted to clarify that the storyLINE is not complex, the the world the story takes place in is. It has a lot of ongoing elements which are managed decently well, showing that Tite Kubo can manage a large, complex world with not too much difficulty. The plot is by no means complex. Art -- 7 Unlike Naruto Shipp., Bleach has had fairy consistent art. It does peak at some times and slouch at others, but it is basically consistent. It isn't stellar, and can't compare to the likes of Romeo X Juliet, Code Geass, Eureka 7, etc. But for a mainstream shonen, it's acceptable and palatable. Honestly, I would just leave art blank...it doesn't really add or subtract from the show, at all. Sound -- 8 Bleach, for being one the top kings of shonen anime, has a lot of very recognizable tunes. Many of them are sweet, many sad, and are generally very fitting. Most of the opening themes and end themes are well done and enjoyable, and overall, very recognizable and memorable. Yui's ""Rolling Star,"" the several themes by Aqua Timez, and other themes make the anime have both popular, modern Japanese pop/rock music, as well as some very beautiful, haunting instrumental pieces (See: Never Meant to Belong). The music I'd say is tied with Naruto's and far ahead of One Piece's. It doesn't quite match up to Romeo X Juliet's (see: Lena Park's cover of ""You Raise Me Up""), but is overall very decent and well rounded, as to be expected of a big budget show like Bleach. Character -- 6 Bleh. Character. There really isn't too much development character wise; one of the main supporting characters, Orihime, does manage to grow from the frightened girl to a mature(ish), courageous (albeit still useless) supporting character. Ichigo, the protagonist, also progresses in terms of his understanding of the world(he seemed very naive in the beginning of the anime, and seems much more experienced now, though they are overplaying this a little much). The major drawback to Bleach's characters is the way their power levels are determined. Ichigo starts off incredibly weak, barely able to beat anyone -- and in a matter of days, thanks to a three day crash course in Shinigami fighting (must be one hell of a crash course) manages to beat some of the toughest shinigami around, including the Third Seat (third most powerful) of the fighting squad, and then shortly after the leader of the fighting squad. By the end of the first arc, Ichigo is able to, with only his fists, destroy three second-seats(a.k.a. vice-captains) in the Shinigami military without breaking a sweat. So by the end of that arc, you understand, wow, Ichigo is really, really badass. But then you find him again shortly after, and he's back to fighting like crap and can't beat anything. And then some amazing thing will happen (see:Hollowfication) that will make him stronger than any shinigami, and then he will have his power cut back, again. And it continues like this. Ichigo, a lot like other characters, seems to have ""Godlike"" strength, and can only fight equally 'Godlike' characters, otherwise the fights would be boring. This is nice and all, but when he actually physically changes from maybe the worst fighter to the best and then back again, the confusion that ensues between the ""god fights"" is confusing and disconcerting, to say the least. Enjoyment -- 7 Bleach has awesome fight scenes. And a very large world, with a lot to think about. I personally love Bleach, and it remains one of my favorite anime. But it has a lot of drawbacks. It has very poor character development, and serious issues in character balancement. It also has meh art, which isn't something bad, but nothing good, either. The story is nice and long. But it has a lot of holes in it, as well as having issues with entertainment value in filler vs. main story. The fact that it randomly skips around often due to the filler also adds confusion, since sometimes the filler will occur BEFORE the arc you were just watching. Overall -- 7.0 .5 lower than Naruto Shippuuden, in my opinion. Bleach is worth a watch if you enjoy the stereotypical shonens: it's creative and interesting. But it is a show MADE for people to watch: it's a mainstream shonen. Naruto had the hand up on terms of story depth, in my opinion, as well as consistency in the story. They both have good soundtracks and VA's, and both have not-so-good character development. The enjoyment varies; I honestly think Bleach has a higher rewatch-ability, but Naruto has some very specific episodes which are amazing.",7,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8c1071df8f,4
"Disclaimer: This is the first ever review I am ever writing on this site. Please do not expect an outstanding piece of work out of this review. Additionally, this is my personal opinion and you may choose to agree or disagree with me. Thank you. I got into Bleach after reading all about its generally positive feedback. I agreed with all the positive things I have seen about the anime until they started introducing some really trashy fillers, not to mention the extremely long and draggy battles fought throughout the course of the anme, Well, to be fair, I do know why they do these fillers: To ensure that the anime does not catch up with the manga too quickly. However, the problem with Bleach is that most of the fillers are really, really hate-able. Provided,I found the Shinigami Zanpakuto Unknown arc to be particularly enjoyable until Muramasa revealed that he materialized all the Zanpakuto just so to revive his ""beloved"" master (who abandoned him for his selfish ego). Not to mention that the arc involving the ""Bounto"" was extremely boring, and full of corny jokes (I especially disliked the creepy chicken doll who acted in an extremely bitchy manner). For the story-line, I think the only *really* good one ever done was the arc where Ichigo first met Rukia, and then had to go rescue her. Everything then went downhill from there (Yes, that includes the manga). Additionally, the common trend for most battles in the series follows this formula: 1) Both sides stare at each other in an *ahem* intimidating manner. 2) One of them says something to irritate the opposing side, and the other reacts by attacking (and making a huge fuss about it by a) screaming {SHUT UP! (URUSAI!) } or b) keeping silent so as to make fans go like ""KYAA~~~! He/She's so DANRED cool!"") 3) This is when flashbacks will start appearing, and we will literally be scammed into watching stuff we have already seen before. 4) When one of them has the upper hand, he/she just haaas to spoil it by going like ""Behind you! (Kochi!)"", ""Where do you think you are looking (Doko ni irun da?!)"", or some other phrase to attract the opponent's attention. This spoils the mood of the fight by extending it for a unnecessarily longer period of time (in terms of episodes). 5) The fella on the ""good side"" will almost always get defeated (with more flashbacks too) and some other idiot screaming (I will avenge you!) in the background, and then . . . The fight against the same opponent continues for more episodes! The art used in the series is very well done, with fresh backgrounds introduced frequently in various scenes and angles, so as to perk up the animations. The sound effects are well, okay (the same effects are used throughout many other series), and the music is astoundingly memorable, with my favorite being ""Nothing can be Explained"". It is hence a huge pity that all of this beautifully-done artwork and music is being wasted on an anime that has lost its glamour ever since its first arc. To sum up this review, I will strongly recommend *new* viewers to quit following the series after the end of the Soul Society arc.",4,Not Recommended,"Feb 24, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_194ba6c39a,4
"Bleach was an anime i got into after a recommendation from a friend. At the time I had caught up to naruto and was looking for another good shounen anime. I was introduced to bleach and I was hooked. However as time passed, the quality of the series took a significant dip. Here is why. Story- In the beginning Bleach had alot going for it. It had an interesting premise. Shinigami aka Death gods send Hollows or Evil spirits to the after life. It was comparable to ghost busters if i may say so. The 1st 15 episodes were of this nature, focusing on Ichigo Kurosaki the main character slaying hollows. The introduction of Renji And Byakuya shook things up and propelled the story into its 2nd arc, The Soul Society arc. This was were Bleach was at its peak: Brand new characters were introduced, The awe inspiring concept of Shikais and Bankais were jaw dropping at the time and a mysterious conspirator moved in the background. It was all very very good stuff. The infamous reveal at the end of the SS arc made me excited that big things were on the way for bleach Then the bount arc happened. A 45 episode long filler, while decent for a filler made my interest in bleach drop. Sadly as the arrancar arc began, that interest never really picked up as the same damsel in distress plotline was rehashed, the plot devolved into 1 vs 1 battles every episode with no real story or character development and ludicrous plot twists arose. Kubos bleach train had long since derailed itself from its tracks by the time the Arrancar Arc ended and The fullbring arc began. Now the once impressive Bankais are no big deal since every character can use them. The damage had been done. 300+ episodes of pointless fighting had all but destroyed any hope i had for the series. The fullbringer arc was a major letdown and is widely considered to be the worst arc in Bleach. With uninteresting villains, a plot clearly made up as it went along and a very weak conclusion, this arc destroyed the show and resulted in its eventual cancellation. Currently The Thousand Year War Arc is going on in the manga and while better than the Arrancar and fullbringer arcs, It has again fallen into the same old 'Forget plot, focus on 1 on 1 battles' formula that has plagued bleach since the arrancar saga began all those years ago. Art- The art is a major plus point for bleach. Certain fights are animated beautifully and i could sit down and watch those repeatedly. Kubo has always had an eye for great character designs. However the lack of backgrounds brings the rating down. Sound- Bleach has an excellent soundtrack. The arrancar arc especially has some catchy spanish tunes while the bounto arc has haunting music befitting the vampire theme of that arc. Overall id say its worth a listen. Character- Bleach has cool character designs but an overload of characters, many of whom overlap with each other. In other words in its like creating a new character but throwing in a personality of another old character. e.g Riruka and Hiyori. There was alot of potential in bleach before. Now characters have just become caricatures of themselves with no real character progression. Inoue is still a damsel in distress. Chad still lies face down in a pool of his own blood. Mayuris mad scientist vibe which was once scary has been made into a running gag. Byakuya and Kenpachi are now jokes. Ichigo is the only character capable of holding his own to the enemy and thats in part due to kubos inability to decide what to do with him. Is he a hollow, shinigami quincy or fullbringer? Kubo has no idea what to do with Ichigos character and even goes so far as to negate everything we have learnt about the characters sword for the past 500 chapters in a major ass pull. Not good. Enjoyment- Bleach was once very enjoyable. Now i read it for the sake of it, just to finish it. Overall- Id recommend the 1st 63 episodes. Otherwise skip it. Its not worth the time.",3,Not Recommended,"Feb 10, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_96e4196dd1,4
"Bleach is an interesting anime... the first episode blew me away, the art, the sound, the portrayal of the characters... The development of Ichigo as a Shinigami and his gradual acceptance of this new plane of existence was interesting to watch and just as we viewers are settling in, BANG!!! Events are put into motion that see our main protagonist stabbed several times and left for dead by the soul 'powers that be.' Woah, i thought, pretty heavy stuff. Then came the Soul Society arc and that too is amazing, the reiatsu effects, the animation of the fights, the snappy dialouge (Kenpachi's blood crazed babbling about Ichigo's power level is still a highlight for me.) There's some big evil conspiracy... etc i won't spoil it too much for those who haven't already watched it but if your on this website and still haven't figured out the conventions of shonen anime then... go figure. Of course as with all shonen series all is eventually resovled, but its not long before things start to go wrong. Hyper powerful bad guys show up, and thats when things start to turn sour. Huge power discrepancies and plot holes have begun to appear in the last couple of arcs (this especially applies to the manga btw) but hopefully these will be resolved over the next year or so. All in all though its a good watch which does put a somewhat new spin on the shonen genre in my eyes (for example instead of just having a stronger version of a form Kubo was inventive enough to 'blur lines'. Should be interesting to see what he does for the next power up if there is one). And so i leave you with this anime fans If you like sword fights, magic, comedy, a bit of blood, sexual tension and good ol' climatic 'final blow explosion things' then you'll enjoy Bleach.",9,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd55fe4d2a,4
"Bleach has got to be one of the worst series I have ever watched and I've watched 113 series. I heard that the show will be returning soon so I have to deliver the facts as to why this series is dead Firstly , The story in Bleach is so tedious and lacklustre , it is a blatant Yu Yu Hakusho ripoff and in short , it follows a teenage boy who gets chosen to be a part of the Spirit FBI and so he joins and as such is forced to wear a ridiculous outfit and fight with a kitchen knife The power scaling in this show is all over the goddamn place , everytime I sneezed Ichigo had a new power up and I thought it couldn't get worse than Dragon Ball The characters in this show are so generic and one-dimensional , You get your cliche dumb but strong (thanks to plot) MC , generic emo kid and generic tsundere who only has one line throughout the whole series The music in this series is awful and overrated Overall : Stay away from this garbage , I've also read TYBW arc in the manga , it did absolutely different aside from give me the best sleep of my life . This series is drawn out , badly written and just unenjoyable don't waste your time",1,Not Recommended,"Nov 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_86099ff853,4
"Death Gods, demonic entities, transforming super-powered weapons that might possibly have the potential annihilate the world....What is there not to like about Bleach? And for the record i will consider only the main story in this review. The story is straightforward but has a lot of details to go with it, though i'll leave it simplistic to avoid spoilers. It begins with a teenage boy name Kurosaki Ichigo, though in my opinion he appears a bit older, and he meets a shinigami by the name of kuchiki Rukia. Through an incident that involves the lives of Ichigo's family, Ichigo gains shinigami powers and is subsequently forced to do Rukia's job as shinigami, becoming a subsitute shinigami. From the awakening the his powers, Ichigo also inadvertently awakens the hidden powers of his friends, Inoue Orihime and Sado Yasutora, through several incidents during Ichigo's job as a substitute shinigami for Rukia. He also meets Ishida Uryuu, a archer of sorts, and all of them will eventually work together, though you'll have to watch to see how and why. Soon after Rukia is forced back to her world, known as soul society, and Ichigo and company follow suit in order to help her out. Compressing a lot events together, Ichigo manages to help out Rukia and finds out that there are more sinister things going on in soul society, and of course, Ichigo and the others are dragged into all of it. The story of bleach is entertaining, and alternates between many fight scenes, and dialogue to push the story ahead. At many times the story can be tense but the occasional lightheartedness makes it much better. While the artwork of the characters and background are quality work, there are some animes that are much better (don't take it too seriously as i was being very critical about the art). The characters are exquisitely made, with each character having a unique and memorable personality, but also very deep and complex, which is for the better. Overall, Bleach is one anime series that you should add to your watching list.",9,Recommended,"Jul 8, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_372c6d4b5c,4
"Bleach used to be my favorite show, the SS arc was very interesting despite being dragged and I had enjoyed the begining of Arancar arc but... this show has no excitement for me now. The only pluses left are the character designs, I still admire Kubo for his drawing skills and design but as an author he fails. There is no real story anymore. We are stuck with constant fightings with no real progrss. Even those fights are boring for one simple reason - you know how it will end: a) Good guy wins b) Good guy gets help and wins In both scenarios bad guy loses and dies. The whole arrancar arc happend to be a waste of time. They made no change to the story. All good guys are still alive and all their lost limbs will be restored by Orihime. Kubo said that he plans to do more arcs so al those shikais/bankai will appear again. He basicly wasted 2-3 years on nothing. Espadas had received so much heap in the beginig, captains almost pissed themselves yet all espadas were defeated easily even by those who are not that powerful. It was also said that Vasto Lordes are at he same level as captains if not stronger and that 10 of them could destroy SS. And later Kubo states in interview that part of espadas were Vasto Lorde... who had lost quiet easily... just WTF?! Where did all the promised power go?! Shouldn't they be even MORE dangerouse after being hollowied by Hougyoko? How the hell that one sided battle can be called a war? All bad guys are dead while all goodies are alive... jsut what kind of fairy tale is that?! Where is the drama, tension, deaths? How can you be excited about a fight when you know how it will end? Also another huge minus is Ichigo. I will be quiet about SS arc where this loser was able to beat captains with hundreds years of experiance only after several week training. They should have been able to kill him with closed eyes! Having talent wouldn't save your ass gaianst masters in such short time. But ok, I can live with that... Better tell me what the hell is with all those power ups?! He always gets beaten down or killed but then once Orihime opens her mouth, he smashes bad guy in seconds, just WTF?! How is that possible?! He even comes back to life after being killed! Then he gets into some convenient place where he can train and owns bad guys ass. Also why all bad guys had turned into idiots? Why good guys who are served in half and have crushed organs are alive, but bad guys with some cuts are dead? THIS SUCKS! I give this show 5 only from respect of the old times and the characters which I still like. If not those things, it would be 1! P.S.

"Art - Character design is ok, but it gets QUALITY a lot. The action in Bleach is even more boring than Naruto. 1 out of 3. Character - The characters are dumb. Everyone has to talk shit to each other before, during, and after beating each other up. Completely brainless egotistical behavior. I was actually surprised when Ichimaru Gin somehow managed to prevent Kenpachi from fighting Byakuya. But later on I was relieved when the captains finally begin fighting each other - it was only a matter of time. Luckily all they seem to be capable of doing was cutting each other on the shoulder. Fucking stupid. Obviously Death Gods and Hollows have neither parents nor siblings so there's no need to talk about those. 0 out of 4. Story - Nonsensical ghost story with DBZ-esque power-ups added in. Fights devolve into beamspamming. Nobody ever dies. Whole story summarized: Aizen trolls everyone. 0 out of 3.

"Bleach is so good. Like, seriously. And people say it's trash just because of the fillers. Like, guys, just skip them. You can do so, then do so. Because the only problem of Bleach is fillers (which, by the way, are never worse than the Naruto ones). I skipped all of them, and what I've seen was simply awsome. The story is great, with great plot-twists too. Aizen is the best antagonist ever. All the characters are so well-written and the bankais are amazing. They're all so unique! There also are very deep speeches, great battles, and the music... oh, the music! The openings are all bangers, and the background music is really good too. The animation isn't the best, but it's not the worst either.

"[Sorry for my bad English, I'm not english... I used Google Translate for this rewiew... Really sorry...] ""Bleach"" is one of those Anime who needs no introduction. Anyone even remotely meant Anime certainly knows him, being the only one able to rival the more famous ""Naruto"" and ""One Piece"". Despite the paper version is still in progress, the anime ""Bleach"" has ended, and in my opinion could do it already episode 310. I hate to give only 9 to ""Bleach"", it 'was my favorite anime for some time and I would have gladly given a 10, were it not for the final saga about Fullbring, that I did not like very much. Let's order: ""Bleach"" is a shounen that stands out from the others, as has been widely criticized for having little dialogue. This would be a disadvantage? I think it is the strong point of ""Bleach"". In a shounen, focused on the fighting, it is these that must occupy much space as possible. It 'just that he wants the viewer, not absurd, and sometimes irritating, monologues and / or flashbacks that do not give anything to anyone, that can be found in large amounts in the aforementioned ""Naruto"" and' 'One Piece' '. I'm just fighting the strong point of ""Bleach"": OST sublime, epic duels, characters, one more badass of the other, and a simple plot and linear, since actually only serves to give a logical clashes between Hollow, evolved or no, and Shinigami. So fighting exceptional and charismatic characters as I did not see the legendary ""Dragonball Z"", just think of the epic Freezer. Yes, certainly, ""Bleach"" could take, from signed, a 10, in my private list I gave it, but here, having to review, I could not do it, for the reason I mentioned above; in fact, it is logical to think, an Anime, in the long run, in most cases, it ends up ruined, and unfortunately this is well evident in ""Bleach"". WARNING SPOILERS: The author has evidently finished ideas, and in order not to end the manga, with all the rounds of money that goes with it, he decided to continue it, although the story is, in my opinion, but also according to many others, ended after the episode 310, or volume 48, whichever you prefer. The defeat of Aizen, powerful to request a deus ex machina, as the unlikely transformation of Ichigo in a shinobi with long hair blacks, it was a perfect ending of the entire work. It seems obvious to me. The final boss is defeated, and with him all his subordinates. There are more enemies to defeat, and Ichigo lost his powers, returning the human that was the beginning. A worthy ending, leaving no room to continue, just as it should be. But no. Tite Kubo, decided to deface this series literally, inventing a saga, the fact of Fullbring, only to be able to give back the powers to Ichigo, and continue so the entire manga. This has been the bane of ""Bleach"", which has become another ""Naruto."" That said, I would still recommend ""Bleach"" to anyone looking for souls crammed clashes, and characters as charismatic as strong, one shounen badass, in short.",9,Recommended,"Nov 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ef3fb0fe2c,4

"Bleach is a story with a lot of potential. It falls short almost every time it has a chance to impress the viewer/reader. Almost every fight goes the same way, a new move/form is either discovered or they get reinforcements, the character depth doesn’t get explored very much throughout the series for well over half of the cast, everyone is often times fairly one dimensional as well, one can also argue the lore feels very strung together at times and serves the plot at complete randomness, arcs drag on a bit too long and overstay their welcome, arcs repeat similar patterns as previous ones, the power scaling is very linear and this leaves for not many surprises in battle, every interaction is plot armored heavily leaving it to feel like characters have minimal agency over their own story, while ichigo is cool, he as a character is ironically pretty….hollow ( lmao ), the art is good, but backgrounds are often neglected detail ( not necessarily a negative, maybe a stylistic choice ), too many filler if you’re anime only ( this problem was huge back when bleach was being made, not necessarily going to hold that against it, that was much more of an industry problem, however if you don’t skip them it still greatly hurts the experience besides a few arcs ), no character goal or motivation seems to have much nuance in this story ( with a few exceptions ), I listed most of what I think the negatives of bleach are. I could make the same list of things that I think are F***ING AWESOME, about bleach as well. Bleach has a soundtrack and it’s absolutely amazing, they have a new style for almost every encounter and it’s beautiful. I find myself listening to this OST while playing video games, working out, or doing anything where I want to feel energy from music, it’s legitimately brilliant. Bleach also has a very cool character design. Most parts of this anime are simply and entirely infused with swagger. There’s no better way to put it, bleach in many aspects is just f***ing cool. Even if something doesn’t make sense, they make it seems like the coolest thing you might ever witness. It definitely helps bleach and its shortcomings to at the very least have it appear bad ass even when on its low points. The characters while fairly simple, are extremely charismatic. It’s easy to be charmed by the cast relatively quickly. Bleach can get very brutal and is themed in a really dark manner. There are many instances that bleach feels lifeless and hopeless and it does this theme well. It makes it all the more tense and much more gut wrenching when seeing the afterlife’s only protectors in a crisis. All the more triumphant when they win as well. The bleakness of bleach can be its strength, but also a weakness. It plays back into everyone feeling relatively one dimensional along with there seemingly being no goals or purpose beyond the threats that arise ( which you know, fair enough that’s their purpose in a sense ). All in all, I like bleach. It’s a time investment so that’s something to consider, but I personally enjoyed this anime enough for what it is. By no means is it perfect or even near my favorites, but I will always remember it. Many things that commence in this show are absolutely iconic. It will have its ups and downs if you do choose to watch it, that’s something to be fully prepared for. I would say that there are better shonen out there, however bleach has a specific flavor that I’ve never seen replicated. For that and that alone, I appreciate it as an anime very much. I think how you feel about this series solely depends on a few things. 1. How much or how important are the things I just mentioned to you? 2. What do you value out of bleach or in other words, what did you come in expecting to get out of the series. 3. Were the spectacular parts of bleach enough to have you thoroughly enjoying the manga/anime through to the end? 4. ( this is an important one ) How much do you like shonen as a genre to begin with? I can tell you right now, someone who hates shonen will hate this show. While watching and reading, it began to feel like to me, many shonen traits and popular tropes I’ve seen mimicked throughout the years must’ve came partially from bleach. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was kind of funny to realize during my time consuming it. Either way, love or hate the series, bleach seems to be a show and manga that is polarizing to an extent. Some people may love it, some may hate it, some may think it’s meh. All have perfectly valid reasons for feeling each way, I truly believe it all depends on your own personal value system with this anime. Thank you for reading. I tried to be fair, concise and straightforward, nothing too complex to write about. Hopefully I accomplished that and also gave new and old viewers alike a broader perspective of bleach as a whole. I would encourage new readers/viewers to take what I said to heart and really consider if they want to continue with watching it. At least for me, when I have a large time investment in an anime or really anything, I want to feel like it’ll be worth it as I’m sure most others do as well. The “ worth it “ aspect of bleach will depend on how you feel about everything I mentioned. BUT hey…at least if you watch it you can say you’ve seen one of the big three :) . It’s a huge foundation of the industry, so it’s cool to at least try out. Maybe give it a chance and see if it’s for you.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 7, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_936e0326d3,4
"Bleach gets a lot of hate but, I just love how long the series was, getting to know all the characters and traveling through the plot with the different characters. This anime made you love the bad guy, see the evil character's perspective and almost feel bad for them. You could vividly see which character you relate well with, because there are a TON of them. I loved the uniqueness behind each character and the overall world that Bleach presents. if you are looking for great art, Bleach is not really one to present that. If you are not willing to commit to some filler episode that really make no absolute sense, Bleach is not for you. Same if you don't like the idea of an OP main character.

"First thing's first...this is some of the worse English dubbing I've heard since the early-mid 80's dubs (not counting Naruto&hellip;which shall not be mentioned again)....there....it needed said. Characters have been altered dramatically and in many cases ruined by the &ldquo;voice actor&rsquo;s&rdquo; work. That being said &ndash; this review is solely for the original Japanese Audio version. This is a reasonably fair adaptation of the source manga &ndash; however my watching the show first made my bias pretty clear in its favor. Great characters, fun interactions, and a nicely progressive story keep my interest high in this show. Rather than ranting how Kenny, Ichimaru, Urahara, or &hellip; well any of the many superb characters are great &ndash; or how endlessly amusing the Zanpakto system is I will instead say the only two beefs I have with this show. Number 1 &ndash; whoever made this show sold their soul to know when to put in cliffhangers. So far I believe the series has consisted of 3 or 4 episodes linked by a hundred+ &ldquo;to be continued&rdquo; screens. Now granted this is awesome for suspense and keeping you hooked like an addict &ndash; but when you catch up and have to wait with everyone else it can get bug you from time to time. Number 2 &ndash; &lsquo;Special Edition&rsquo; story arcs. This manga was popular enough that the show was made quickly and often. However, this has created complete story arcs of pseudo-filler because the show caught up with the manga. The entire Bounto/Bound/(however you want to say it) saga?

Something completely different!&rdquo; This show is very fun and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it &ndash; taking the fun swordplay from Kenshin and the absurd abilities and power levels from Dragonball Z. It successfully takes only the good from each, burning the rest, and tossing in its own little blend of fun. Oh...and expect ULTRA-DIEGETIC music throughout.

"Storyline In my own opinion, Bleach has one of the most captivating pilot(first) episodes I have ever seen. The storyline itself is also very intriguing and quite fascinating. The mix of action and comedy is exquisitely implemented and each episode almost always ends on a high note. The only negative comment I have is on all the useless filler episodes that are scattered throughout the series and the one filler arc (bounto arc). Art My overall impression of the art is satisfying. And on certain episodes you can really see they took out all the stops, making it a spectacular feast for the eyes. As the anime progresses, the animation quality and character designs for the most part does also. Sound The sound is good and I must say I am quite fond of their musical score, which significantly helps build up the atmosphere. Character Since this is an ongoing anime, they have ample opportunities to expand on character profiles and backgrounds, which they execute almost perfectly. Overall You only have to ask yourself why Bleach is one of the most popular anime series at the moment. It&rsquo;s a blend of action, comedy, a great plot and interesting characters.",9,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5a284803b6,4
"Story: You can see how the story of Bleach has captivated a large majority of those that watch anime. It’s a fantasy of many; to be transformed from a regular guy to a hero with a badass sword. Being very shounen, it echoes the characteristics of other popular anime such as DBZ, where the excitement comes from exceeding limits in power and beating ridiculously strong opponents - against all odds. Unfortunately (for us), Bleach has fallen into a large and highly populated pitfall where this story is not masterfully told. At all. It is a long, drawn out filler poop-fest with plot holes and some irritatingly predictable twists along the way. The fantasy wanted to watch is spoiled with every episode and is way too drawn out for you to care in the end. Overall, the fact that the story is so spread out across so many episodes is the flaw that makes it so bad. It doesn’t feel intense and the climatic parts of the story just don’t arouse the way they should. Characters: Most of the time the characters felt 2-D. It felt like I was watching an anime which made it a mostly painful experience. Don't get me wrong, I don't want a sob story all the time but I didn't feel connected I guess. Nonetheless, not all character development in Bleach is pants. There are definitely some characters that make you interested in the plot and its eventual conclusion but generally, this is spread very thin across its 300+ eps. Mostly, the interesting characters are the ones that are shrouded in mystery thus generating the appeal. Others are just too cool for you to dislike but that leaves you with a very shallow set of characters. It isn’t enough to keep you entertained for the amount of episodes that there are. Art / Animation: Absolutely freaking shite. It is so bad. You would think that an anime with poor character development and an under-emphasis on the story would have some epic fight sequences but no. It really doesn't. Most episodes are filled with still images with shoddy layering techniques, they are constantly re-using animations, there is minimal expression and low (and sometimes absolutely no) movement - even in fight scenes!! It makes it boring and incredibly hard to watch - honestly. It is shockingly bad animation for an anime (",3,Not Recommended,"Jul 22, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f18919dad6,4
"Really, where to start from with Bleach? Because there are many good and many foul things about this anime... Let's start from the good ones though. First of all, I liked the art; I loved how the characters were created, they were fluid, flawless and realistic, as if they were dancing with their swords during all their epic battles. Then after, the music was spectacular. I always notice the background music, it is a very important part of the excitement and development of an anime and I believe Bleach creators nailed it. A mix of powerfulness, anticipation, emotion, sadness, pain, fear, those tracks had everything, every single one of them individually. Great job on that. Now for the plot; well, to be totally honest, I have mixed feelings about the plot. The idea is good, really good but there are plenty of flaws and holes in the way. I absolutely loved the first arc with Soul Society, as it gave me an insight of the characters personal worlds, helped me understand who is who and what he/she is capable of, all the stories and pains each character - major or minor - carried upon their shoulders... In general, the first arc kept me on the very edge and then surprised the hell out of me (not going to spoil here), so I can tell I enjoyed it 100%. Now for the rest of the anime... The rest was kinda boring, to put it simply. Okay, yes, there were some epic battles, some cool pep-talk, some deep words of friendship and companionship, supporting your friends, saving your friends, saving everybody in general - that's Ichigo ladies and gentlemen; the boy is the incarnation of utter sacrifice. I think that's why he is so popular with the viewers, including me - but all these things were dragged out for too long. Especially the unimportant blabbering during the battles, which ended up killing all the thrill and epicness about them. Plus, the second arc with the Espadas and Hueco Mundo was almost like the Soul Society arc, only that we didn't have Shinigami but Hollows to fight. Let's just say that I mentally skip the ever-going talk during the battles and reach the final battle, the big boss, badass transformations from both Ichigo and the final boss, yeah okay. But that was it. Nothing too remarkable about it, the wow factor non-existing. I think, Bleach would be a better anime if it stopped there because, yes, it continues. As a big fan, I watched it nonstop until the Hueco Mundo arc ended. Then after, I simply couldn't finish it, so boring it was. Again, these endless talk-battles, where the characters did more talking than fighting, the plot growing confusing and fragmented - a huge no-no for me. New characters and new skills introduced, skills that were of none importance in the very end. Apparently Tite Kubo wanted to stuff his characters with more and more ""experience"", to show how ultimate Ichigo's power is but bottom line is... He achieved nothing but me yawning. Which of course brings my focus to the characters only. There are so many characters in this anime, I don't even know where to begin from. And each one has to have his/her own stage time, no matter how useless or minor he/she is. I understand that a good mangaka doesn't leave his secondary characters unattended but the problem is that none of the characters had some sort of development, no matter how long his/hers stage time was. Not even Ichigo developed, who is supposed to be the main character. Yes, he got stronger, yes he got better at fighting, learnt a lot about himself but for me, that was almost insignificant because it happened too quickly, from one day to the other. His badass-ness and cockiness stayed until the very end (which is good), his stubbornness too, but all I can say is that he simply matured and got prettier. Nothing important in that. I think, there were two characters that showed some form of development before Kubo decided to cease their growth and bam, kick them to the ground again. These two were Renji and Gin. The rest of the hundred thousand characters in this story, were neutral, with no significant role except their fandom. Not that I don't like the rest of the characters, that's not it; it's just that Kubo wanted to focus on each of them separately, spending way too much of our time. That's what makes Bleach boring in a way. What you should also be aware of: this anime has A LOT of fillers. I'm not even going to go there in much detail. Just skip them, for your own good and once you've finished the actual story, if you're curious, watch them. Be prepared to yawn, I know I did. I give this story an overall 8 and I know that it doesn't correspond to all the bad things I've mentioned above but it is worth watching. Why? Because I strongly believe that there are many things behind every event and character, many ideas and messages they want to pass to the viewer/reader and that is mainly why I gave the anime 8. It shows how important friendship and support are, strength, not only physical but mental also, refers to maternal love, paternal love, as well as sacrifice, betrayal, loyalty, trust, pain and suffering and how easily these can be transformed into power... I think I'm missing a lot, but for a first glance, that's about it. I hope my review was helpful to you.

I keep thinking about the picture, if he only improvises or if everything is planned. That is really amazing that he actually can make so many people happy with this anime/manga. In times it is very serious but suddenly go totally out of line. It makes you laugh to the greatest extent and the caracters are so amusing.

"My first review! I watched the anime right up until one of the ""climax"" arcs, the war *minor spoiler* between the shinigami captain and the godmode villian, Aizen. I read the manga right up till the fullbring arc, then dropped the entire thing in disgust. I can't rmb how many episodes of bleach i've watched, but will just give an arbitrary figure of 100. The beginning of the story was interesting, it was good enough to hook you as an audience and keep you interested in the plot, albeit the typical save the girl was at play here, there were many interesting characters, like ever-grinning ichimaru gin, resourceful mentor urahara kisuke and badass kenpachi. then the initial arc climaxed at the reveal of a powerful villain before heading straight into the arrancar and vizard arcs, which were still good. The storyline begins to plummet after the fight with ulquiorra, the fights with the top 3 espada were very disappointing, and needless to say, the godmodding with aizen after is just..... speechless. beyond that, the fullbring arc was absolute nonsense and after that, the quincy arc just seems, rushed, like he had no better way to end the story. If Kubo ended the story after the war, (minus fullbring and blood war arcs) it would have gotten a higher score, but as it stands, the manga is now downright terrible. Art is good, which is pretty much the reason why i bother (most of it, anyway). Characters were run of the mill, and overall enjoyment went from a score of 8-7 at agent of the shinigami/rescue rukia to 7-6 at the arrrancar arc, then plummeted to 5-4 thereafter. it dropped to 3 at the point i dropped it, which was the fullbring arc.",3,Not Recommended,"May 26, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e6396a283e,4
"personally, Bleach was my gateway anime (that sounds a little weird). A major complaint bleach gets is all of the filler, this is due sourly to shonen jump wanting more money. As far as filler goes, its mostly limited in the non-canon seasons, but all you have to do is skip the filler seasons, unless you want to watch a ""what if"" story of bleach. STORY: ""All the arcs are just the same"" that is said by people who fvcking nit-pick at everything. Sure bleach's first 2 events involve someone getting kidnapped, going to a new world, and ichigo gains a new power. BUT the story's are unique to each other, due to HOW and WHY they begin and resolve. Kubo (the author) cant help to make multi-worlds, due to bleaech being based off of the Buddhism, which involves multi-worlds, and he cant just show off 2 worlds ( human world and world of the gods) and let everything be ""been there done that"". Now to deal with ichigo gaining new power every new season....SO DOES ALMOST EVERY OTHER SUPER ACTION CHARACTER DOES, like goku (who is fvcking beloved, and makes powers on the spot) and naruto CHARACTERS: In the very beginning of bleach, you get this small group of characters, whose background you'll never know,BUT that's ok, because no one gives a sh!t about them, and their in there for only a few episodes character development is pretty good, most characters who you'll gonna give a sh!t about have a background. But for some characters you wont see for a while. Some characters backstory have only been shown in the latest chapter of the manga. The main character, ichigo, is your classic ""ill protect my friends"" guy but hes truly a lovable character due other aspects of his personalty. Such as fighting against any opponent even if he knows that they can kick his @ss, not in a ""wanna fight"" way, but more of a ""i wont give up"" way FIGHTING: The action scenes are awesome, high speed sword fights. But don't worry, not all of the fights are just sword fighting, once you get later on in the series, you'll start to see more of the characters unique powers. SOUND/ART: In bleach's early production, the sound/art were not very good, but just hang in there till it becomes better over the following seasons. Its like how DBZ started, bad sound and art, but that was just how things were during its time. ENJOYMENT: I personally enjoyed it very well. its still one the anime where I re-watch fights Some people say this is a rip of Yuyu Hakusho, for no other reason other than it resolves around spirits. But really the plot/story's have very few similar traits. Overall, the anime is pretty great. Miner plot holes. The main protagonist is one of those great role models, like goku and naruto are, like they teach lessons to fight for your friends and never give up, no matter how hard life hits you.

"This is my first review, so I apologize if I happen to make a few mistakes. But I had first came across bleach a long time ago when it was shown on Adult Swim, but i decided to re-watch from the beginning back in 2013, & boy I'm glad I did. If you want an action packed, funny, and adventurous plot, then this is a show you should watch. Now, this is just my opinion, but Bleach has to be one of the best action anime to date. Now, I'm sure I don't have to give a summary on what the show is about since one is already given for you but if I had to rate all the factors that make up this anime the score would be these: Story: 8/10 There are various arcs in Bleach, but they are good ones. Now the main story has to be one of the best stories I've watched so far. It kept me on the edge of my seat because I wanted to know what was going to happen. At times it is quite predictable but it doesn't make it boring at all. Art: 7/10 Because Bleach released back in 2004, the art wasn't so great but as it got more into the later years the art became quite good. Sound: 10/10 It has some of the best openings and endings ever. Many of my favorite songs are from the Bleach soundtrack, so you won't be disappointed at all with the sound. Character: 9/10 You see some pretty decent character development in here, as well as some cool as hell characters as well. Enjoyment: 10/10 I don't think reasons are needed for this area. Overall: 9/10 Bleach does have its flaws, I must admit, but it is one of my all time favorites and did not disappoint me one bit. But this is all my own opinion. With Bleach and with every other anime you should never go in with high hopes nor low hopes because you may be surprised. But, give Bleach a shot if you haven't already, although it is one of the most known anime. WATCH IT.",9,Recommended,"Aug 8, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9c633a917f,5
"This is my first review so bare with me a bit please. I chose bleach as my first review because out of the ""big 4"" it is by far my favorite. ~Story~ The story aspect of bleach is amazing. Who doesn't like an underdog facing impossible odds to pull off a win at the last second? this series has a habit of making you angry but then gives you the satisfaction of witnessing the revenge that you hoped for during the build up of each arc. My overall rating for the story is 9.5/10. As badass as the individual arcs are they have a tendency to repeat over and over. ~Art~ The artwork was generic at best near the beginning of the series but as it goes on the artwork gets much better. Usually during fight scenes, anime has a tendency to lose a lot of the details in the characters themselves but bleach always keeps it consistant. I give the artwork a 10/10. ~Sound~ Great music! The sound is great and the timing of it used to create an emotional response is dead on every time. ~character~ The characters in bleach are diverse and support each other nicely. The MC develops relationships with a large group that never seems to stop growing. The MC has a hero complex and has to save everyone from everything by himself and eventually caves to the idea of help. You have the thunders type of personality in Rukia. Dandere personality in orihime. Then you have the rival and the best friend that join his party to complete the group. Overall I say the diversity in the members of this main group of friends makes the show that much more enjoyable. ~Enjoyment~ The enjoyment on this series is a solid 10/10. I'm a big fan of the shonen genre and they did everything right in this anime. Great plot, characters, and superpowers. I think if you're interested in the shonen genre than this anime would be a great pick. There's a dash of romance but they keep it down low so don't expect too much if you're more into that. Overall I give this anime my #1 slot in my all time favorites and its a series I can still to this day watch over and over from beginning to end and never get sick of it.

"Bleach really knows how to do an Anime right if it wants to, problem is...Most times it chooses not to. In its prime, Bleach is literally second to none. It gets its viewer hyped like no other anime I have seen. It has an amazing soundtrack as a tool to get people hyped. It also has amazing fighting scenes that trumps most other long running Anime out there. It also has amazing characters, there will a character that will be enjoyable to any viewer. Problem is, these beautiful moments that I just described only come after enduring all its annoying qualities. It drags out an episode just too long, it makes a viewer wait and wait and wait, until when you think you can't bear it anymore, it hits you with pure awesomeness. Although some could argue that that is what makes those epic moments much more epic. It also has annoying fillers which is not really a problem as far as you search it up on google and skip them.

"I'm going to warn you. The anime completely disappointed me so if you haven't seen it yet and you're expecting it to be really good (like I did - my best friend's fault. I should never again trust her recommendations in anime and movies), this review is going to make you think twice. I mean it. The anime ticked me off BIG time. Of the three points I gave this anime, one point would go to the opening and closing songs (hee); another point would go to the characters that I like (one guy with a green hat who trained the protagonist, the cool antagonist, the white haired boy); and the last point would go to the only episode that I appreciated out of the 45 episodes I watched - EPISODE 1. UUUUGH! What is wrong with this anime??? I mean really?! Such a waste of time! If I wasn't so bored, I wouldn't even - ehem. Sorry. Moving on... Episode 1 pretty much gives a summary of what the movie is all about: a guy who can see ghosts is given the powers of a Death God so that he could kill the bad spirits (called 'hollows') that kill good spirits. I thought that the anime was going to be interesting because the plot sounded new to me. I mean, ""Death God?"", ""sixth sense?"" Yeah, that pretty much persuaded me. As the anime progressed, however, the story was starting to become typical and boring. Not to mention that there were SO MANY unnecessary flashbacks and SO MANY darned scenes that should have been removed (e.g. 30 seconds of watching a character roll on the ground after getting hit by an enemy, a minute of watching a character swish his sword). I mean come on!! I kept forwarding it 75% of the time. It was like a badly made indie indie (redundancy’s intentional) film. What I hated the most about the anime was the protagonist. No it’s not the typical goody-goody, martyr, sweet antagonist girl that I hate. In fact, it's a guy with characteristics that are usually something I can stand. What I couldn't bear about him is how the he's supposed to be someone with SOOOO much talent and SOOOO much power that he's almost SOOOO perfect. Don't get me wrong. I love fiction and I do day dream about impossible stuff AND I am a perfectionist. But, really now, a protagonist who can perfect a technique in three days when it's supposed to be perfected in a 100 years by ""even the most talented"" (quotation from the film)?? A protagonist who's never really been beaten by anybody?? It's SO annoying! And SO unrealistic! And SO urgh!! Wasn't Lelouche beaten by his brother at some point? Wasn't Naruto beaten by Sasuke at some point? Wasn't Ban sliced by some guy at some point? Weren't 4 of the 7 samurais killed? Whew. I really had to get that off my chest. X) All in all, the anime sucks. No offense to whoever made it X) but I hardly ever stop midway when watching an anime. This was the first time that I really lost interest and didn't care about how much I spent on the DVD.

"Oh Boy! Another over 130+ episode anime, with pointless scenes, and unnecessary humor. Great, just great. The plot.. what plot is what I am wondering. While watching this, every so often I found myself questioning this, or when I read other reviews on different websites. There really was no plot, other than a 15 year old boy, in school being able to see ghosts and become a soul reaper. To be all honest I didn't even see the plot in this, it felt more like an episodic anime with no plot at all. The first episode was rather boring, and just lead up to what others would call a breath taking transformation. Breath taking really, I think not. It was rather dull and un impressive. I had to role my eyes at yet another Sailor Moon reminder (without the fancy music or dance). The second episode was a bit better but still I saw no plot to this series. 'sighs' The is a disappoint ment to me. As the show progressed I started to lack in memory of the series. Due to my ability to block out any boring or dull movie scenes, it was an automatic switch on for this series. I didn't like it and the plot seemed to run more on the action and humor instead of itself. There was no real ending so far, just more prologue. Art (Animation)- If you guys no me well, you know I pay a bit more attention to the art instead of the characters or plot, seeing as the english voice cast has away to ruin that for me (unless I am watching subs, I can consentrate more on what is going on with them). Where as many would say that the art was fantastic, or very good.. I say that it seriously lacked. I saw no real creativity for this, not even in the manga itself did I see creativity. The soul, a blue fire ball. It seemed more like light blue paint that they made glow and move. Action scenes with spiritual powers.. also another site of sqlaushed paint being formed into something. I would say the ice of Hitsugiya was probably the only creative thing I seen in the show concerning art. The background now was way to bright, like a Spring Break party. Where it tired to show something gloomy or tragic it failed somewhat, but they did manage to capture rain and clouds right. Character art wasn't so good either. Like Naruto, when a character either gets bruised or has a small cut it would heal quickly without cause. Only major damage showed, pathetic. Hair styles, limbs, and tones could have been better also. I am being rather generous with rating sound a five. Mostly because of the song choices and the not too bad voice cast for this. The songs for the series, though they had a good beat and were somewhat rememberable, it did not match the series at all. Rare cases like Kuroshitsuji's soundtrack actually fit and flow with the story as if it belonged, but most cases like Bleach it was just put there to show off the series. Apperantly, in this case you run good on soundtrack you tend to have a bit more fans.. Nothing of real interest to the songs, a good soundtrack but nothing relating to the series. Voice cast.. now I mind you that I do not watch this on dvds or youtube. I am stuck with AdultSwim and watching it every Saturday, so yes.. I am reviewing for the enlgish dub. How unfortunate. Thankfully, Viz didn't do too bad with it, I felt that though some of the voice actors like JYB didn't fit the roles correctly some did. It wasn't too bad to where you'd hate listening to it, but you can get annoyed by it at times. So it is watchable, I just suggest you be careful before doing so. Characters.. now people are going to hate me for this, I just know it. One charater out of all of them stood out for me.. and that was Orhime. Now before anyone curses me out, let me explain to you this. Orhime, had these god like abilities and yet instead of going into that they skipped over her like a rag doll in garbage. Ouch. Not only that, but I notice (and another person notice as well) that the enter series consentrated more on the males instead of the females. Useless characters I would have to say, seeing as they only put them there for show. How rude is that... I mean you have these amazing girls here, that probably have more power than they show and they are skipped over. What in the world happened I was wondering. Oh and the males.. most of the male characters seem to just stand around and do nothing where as Ichigo bothers to do something about any problem. I mean come on.. all these characters seemed nothing but sueish or stuish to me.. and it hurt me to feel that the series was like a statement that females are only good for their looks. If any anti-club there should notice it was not the girls fault for what the staff did it is the staff and mangaka that ruined their chances. I can't help but rate them a 3.. just poor. Poor development, poor attitudes, and the majority of useless characters. This just irritated me. My enjoyment a three. I found my enjoyment seriously lacking in this series. I was not impressed by the action or attempts at being funny. I was not impressed by the characters, sound, etc. Really, I was just like a china doll staring at the screen. Though I should probably rate it lower if it where that bad, I did find some things rather funny like the blood being thrown at the wall and writting itself. I couldn't help but laugh, or any time Mr. Hat and Clogs came up. Overall.. a 3.4 (3 here). I could not like this series.. not with the serious lack of creativity, anti-female feel, episodic feel, and lack of plot.. just a serious lack of everything. My advise to the staff would be stop and change it. The manga is feeling the same so I am not surprised by this.

"I'm a huge anime fan and I think Bleach is one of the anime that touched me the most. I often watch all the episodes, especially the cult scenes and I can tell you that he teaches us lots of things. It teaches us that even if we are in difficult situations, we can always get out of it and that we must never give up. It also teaches us that friendship is something important and that we must take care of it. Certainly, someone with power does not exist in our worlds, but it makes us dream. I accept that there are episodes that are not ""epic"", but that does not prevent the fact that this anime is excellent. Regarding the story he tells, I admit that from time to time, it is not logical and that there are certain things which are better to correct. As for the fights, there isn't much to say except that these are intense fights and to see that Ichigo never gives up no matter what, it melts my heart.

"The Bleachverse actually takes itself seriously, It honestly was a breath of fresh air compared to other shonen. Ichigo is the only Shonen protagonist who actually shows fear, throughout the series he's constantly reminded that he's weak or not the strongest by his opponents and in some cases isn't afraid to run or retreat. Bleach was such a unique series that actually felt like it was written for teens and at times felt a little more mature, And the music was amazing from its OSTs to the openings, (Chefs Kiss). (Flaws): Unfortunately, Bleach lost most of its momentum because of filler but primarily after the Sousuke Aizen arc. Bleach as a series had such rich and unique characters, but unfortunately, we don't get to see them a lot because the series loved focusing on boring and forgettable characters (sometimes it's done right tho). Furthermore, the Bleach Anime doesn't look like it's coming back and it's a shame since we got such a lacklustre anime-only ending. Man, can they please finish the anime properly the manga is well ahead and ending soon...",8,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_83f8b6cd69,5
"*I did not watch any filler* Bleach is a show that I never thought I would watch, and never thought I would enjoy if I ever did watch, but watching this show was a great choice. There are so many good things about this show that I love, the characters, music, plot, story, fights, and so much more. The best part is that even after watching just this, I can watch the TYBW episodes next, and Ive heard they are even better. The music in the show is just amazing. It is done perfectly in every episode, certain music play for certain scenes and all played appropriate to the situation or whatevers going on in the show, that doesnt even start on how great it is though. As far as I know most of the music in the show was made by Shiro Sagisu, so you can assume its going to be perfect already. There are so many tracks in the soundtrack that have me thinking ""god damn this is just peak"" One noteable track is the theme of Ichigo, Number One, I believe you first hear it on the first episode of the show, and at first I didnt know how good it was until it was played next, the song is always played whenever you know Ichigo is about to go crazy in a fight, and I get hyped for it every single time. Another big thing about the music in the show is the openings and endings, although not really important to the actual episodes I still gotta comment on them, a lot of them are amazing, a lot of them are alright, but there arent really any terrible ones, the music for this show has been done so great. My favorite opening is still the first one and my favorite ending is the second one. Honorable mention, the Vizard theme escalon is freaking awesome too, just love that song so much. Something about the hype I feel when watching this show in multiple scenes, when a character gets a powerup I freak out, when a random character I like shows up, I freak out, when a character I love shows up for the 100th time I freak out, I may be stupid, but this show is just peak for that reason. One more note, I watched the first movie, but I still gotta watch the rest, the first one was pretty good. Anyways, im really happy I watched the show, was very worth it.",9,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_37946c184d,5

The story and plots are well thought out, the battles are totaly awesome. The graphics and sounds are stupendous. The characters personalities, some are used a lot in other animes, but still good none the less. I'm always waiting to see the next episode as of right now.

"Bleach is a great anime in too many ways. It has has great fighting scenes and very unique characters. The comedy is great and the storyline will leave you begging for the next episode to come. However there are flaws like it uses the same music often for the fight scenes and in my opinion not the best choice. It also has a handful of filler episodes which can get rather bothersome at times. If you have the patience for it you will really enjoy it.

"Bleach was my first (subbed) anime, so I will always have a soft spot for it. It started out strongly and got me hooked... within days, I was already 70 episodes in (something I never do). Things start falling apart later on though. This anime has more gaping plotholes than any other in recent memory, and there are plenty of missed opportunities in the storyline. Things that seemed inevitable and natural did not transpire the way one assumed (or hoped) they would. I cannot elaborate due to spoilers, but I think most fans would agree. Regardless of that Bleach has some of the most entertaining combat you're likely to find in anime, and some superbly designed characters, and a gorgeous aesthetic. And a good story, for a while. Beware of the painful filler episodes, but I guess that's natural for an anime that ran as long as Bleach.",10,Recommended,"Feb 12, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_07fa9da7e1,5
"Bleach. It's big. It's japanese. It's avaliable subbed. It's dubbed. It's every-freakin where. And it has an anime. Said anime will be reviewed... now. Story- 7 Wow. The absolutely only way you're ever going to completely follow and get the storyline, plot, and references, you MUST begin with episode 1. The story's that expansive, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. With trying to tell six or seven stories in one episode most times, and the hit-or-miss filler episode consisting of the usual antics in the real world, I would really have to push to call it anything other than good. Art- 8 This is not Ghost in the Shell-type anime, but damned if it doesn't come close. Animations are fluid, effects are appropriate, and character movement is smooth, not jarred and forced. Sound- 6 The sound is varyingly diverse and interesting, but I swear I hear the same music every four episodes or so. You're 125 and over in, maybe it's time to record a few new songs? Character- 6 There have been very few, if at all animes I've seen with SO MANY main characters. Every single character you see (Besides news reporters and regular townsfolk) has a story to tell, and you must (Or be forced to) hear it. And trying to juggle so many character developments, especially in one episode alone, is an out there thing to do. Enjoyment- 8 Let's not mix words- this is a one to keep an eye on. Being a runaway freight train in Japan and starting to hit home in the US on Adult Swim, Bleach is becoming vastly popular quickly. But the features aren't good enough to follow like a religion (which you shouldn't do in the first place). Overall-7 Looking past the balancing act of characters, and the same music every time, Bleach is an enjoyable experience. Just don't devote lives to it.",7,Recommended,"Oct 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_dce1e7bbd0,5
"This anime starts out good, and then sucks a lot later on. Towards the end of the Soul Society arc, everything goes downhill. The story starts to get repetitive and overrun with filler, and character development progressively gets more stale. The artwork and sound effects are of great quality however, and the story isn't too terrible before the Soul Society arc ends. As the anime is right now however, fight scenes and other forms of story progression all take too long, often spanning over what seems like a dozen episodes. All in all, I would highly advise against wasting time to watch the entire anime. The story progresses too slowly, and it's nothing special.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 16, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_962423a02b,5
"Bleach burst onto the scene with its compelling premise and dynamic characters, experiences a notable shift in quality after the exhilarating Soul Society arc. While the series maintains elements of its initial brilliance, the subsequent arcs struggle to recapture the same magic, resulting in a narrative that becomes more average than exceptional. The early episodes of Bleach shine brightest during the Soul Society arc. The stakes are high, character development is robust, and the intricate plot twists keep viewers on the edge of their seats. This arc not only establishes the foundation of the series but also showcases the potential for greatness. One notable downfall comes in the form of pacing issues and an abundance of filler episodes. Post-Soul Society, the narrative often loses its focus, meandering through less impactful storylines. This not only disrupts the flow of the main plot but also dilutes the intensity and urgency established in the earlier arcs. The later arcs witness a dilution of the series' core themes. The intricate exploration of the afterlife and the consequences of interfering with spiritual realms, which was a strong aspect in the early arcs, takes a backseat as the narrative becomes more entangled in battles and power struggles. While some characters continue to evolve, others suffer from stagnant development or, in some cases, undergo abrupt transformations that may not align with their established personalities. This inconsistency in characterization can lead to a sense of detachment from certain characters. The main protagonist - Ichigo's primary evolution is often confined to his fighting abilities. While his prowess in battles escalates, the personal and emotional facets of his character development remain overshadowed by the relentless focus on combat. This imbalance diminishes the opportunity for a more holistic exploration of Ichigo's character. On a positive note, the animation quality remains consistently spectacular throughout the series. The fluidity of fight sequences and the meticulous attention to character designs contribute to the visual appeal that keeps viewers invested in the later arcs despite narrative shortcomings. Bleach remains a nostalgic journey for many fans, including I, who were captivated by its early brilliance. However, the anime's subsequent arcs fail to sustain the same level of excellence. The transition from exceptional to average leaves a lingering sense of what could have been, as viewers witness a series with immense potential not fully realized. Bleach holds a special place in the hearts of many for its gripping Soul Society arc and the initial promise it displayed. However, the subsequent arcs struggle to maintain the same level of quality, with pacing issues, repetitive tropes, and a dilution of core themes detracting from the overall experience. Despite its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved part of anime history, with its early brilliance acting as a testament to the heights the series once achieved. Bleach Soul Society Arc: 10/10. A must watch - at least until the conclusion of Soul Society Arc. Post Soul Society Arc: 6/10.",7,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a3e8bad8bb,5
"Having grown up in Japan, its amazing to me still that I did not immerse myself in the manga culture until I left the country. Bleach is what is considered a mainstream ""shonen anime"" along with Naruto which you probably already have heard of. From what I have heard - giving Bleach a try is the best decision I have made. If you want the short answer to what my review is, this show is a good one. The plot of Bleach is pretty easy to grasp in the beginning. There are Soul Reapers who have the ability to guide souls to the Soul Society which is an afterlife dimension. Reapers not only guide human souls but combat evil spirits to protect everyone. On initial watch, you meet Ichigo the arrogant sarcastic teenage boy (typical character). The first season introduces us to the most important of characters, Rukia and allows us to understand the basic concept of Bleach as we know it. We don't realize until the end the new events that will cause us to go on rescue missions to defend the Soul Society. Finally after the first 50+ episodes a climax takes place and makes the entire season worth watching. But, 50 episodes in - who has the attention span to watch this? Continuing on you are promised great rewards at the end of this brick road. Two arcs are a slow paced action anime which is the issue I've had with it. The Soul Society arc grabs your attention and asks you to be a loyal fan, until its interest plummets. While the Arrancar arc is interesting in new aspects, neither that or the Hueco Mundo arc do much for the senses. Like most cartoons these days, the plot doesn't thicken past the save the damsel in distress mode, and gets old. Many of the repeat fights don't have much oomph to them as we must see the same scenes over again. Aside from the filler, the reusing of plots and damsel in distress Bleach did show an increasing in potential as we dive deeper into the series. The universe comes alive in new ways, and Bleach improves as it matures. The other seasons are not as good as season 1, and leaves your yearning for more. Oddly enough Bleach is still enjoyable to watch even having finished it already. The true excitement is that with every rerun you find something new about the show. You inspect powers of each character, what motivates the villain of each episode and the quirks of the characters. The true spark of this show is in fact the cast, the odd twists and behaviors keeps you coming back for more. Even when the animation fades in and out between low frames and odd character interaction, its still beautiful to watch. What also sparks the imagination to Bleach's claim to fame is their Soundtrack. Each one brings new sound, and revives the old. The tone of each episode is followed closely and does not miss a beat in action and underlying electric tone. I've said this over and over to friends who don't watch anime, watch this one first- give it a few episodes and you'll watch it to the end.",8,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b16727e899,5

"NOTE: There will only be a few spoilers in this review, but I'll be as minimal as humanly possible. I only got to episode 94 before I dropped the series. I'll try not to go into details where appropriate to avoid spoilers. So I used to really enjoy watching Bleach when it was new and just starting to air on Adult Swim late Saturday night years ago. I saw the first episode and found myself hooked, and as each week passed, I would watch an episode. I really liked how the series was pacing along with its initial episodes. Eventually I started to watch the subbed episodes online and still enjoyed it, but then I realized I hit the first episode of the Soul Society Arc. That's when everything started to get bumpy for me. After that arc began, I immediately found myself dreading the storyline instead of enjoying it. The filler episodes before it started off so well, too. With the initial filler episodes, the series showed a whole lot of potential and promise in the future. I was excited for the moment that everything would really start. I was so wrong. If you must know, the Soul Society Arc starts at about episode 20, and it involves a key character being abducted and needing to be rescued from another world, the Soul Society. So I started to watch the episodes here and found myself realizing the show seemed significantly less exciting at this point. But I figured after maybe five or ten episodes, they'd wrap everything up and move onto the next big thing. After all, it was only episode 20. They'd be done soon, right? Later on to around episode 40, THE ENTIRE ARC IS STILL GOING AND STILL ISN'T FINISHED. If you think about it, most anime shows last 50 episodes before they wrap everything up, but this arc wasn't even finished. The writing gave me the impression that the author was dragging his feet and improvising the entire thing as he went along. But hey, some shows last more than 50 episodes and are still doing great, right? So I continued to watch. I end up around episode 60 and I'm just dreading how long this arc managed to be stretched out. Especially after a particularly pointless and painful filler episode (I think it was episode 50) that seemed so out of place and out of nowhere just earlier. And finally, a few episodes after 60, the arc finally comes to an unsatisfying end. That's when I realized this show had another fatal flaw that the first arc made it develop: WAY too many characters. If any of you guys are familiar with Sonic the Hedgehog, the series became a sort of mish mash of annoying secondary characters taking up space. Bleach has a similar problem, but instead of letting them all take up space, the author feels the need to develop each and every single one of them as he goes along, and at times it just feels incredibly forced. It felt like the development of all these characters was holding up the progression of the entire arc and delaying it further, when it could have ended a lot sooner otherwise. Some of them he does an okay job on developing, but other ones just seem annoying and make me wonder why they need to continue existing. But we'll touch up on that a bit more in a moment. Anyway, after the Soul Society Arc ended, it looked like a new arc was going to start, and this one looked a whole lot more promising. The first few episodes of it had me really interested, like this was going to be some kind of psychological and really clever part of the series. However, instead of being an actual arc, it ends prematurely on a very disappointing cop out, where we have several more useless characters introduced as a result. Somebody never told the creator of the series that too many cooks can spoil the broth. So anyway, there's another arc starting, the Bount Arc, and then I find the series going straight back to the feet-dragging, pointless writing of the Soul Society Arc. The arc is so boring and was absolutely painful for me to watch. So much so that most fans have told me that I should have just skipped it. But really, if I have to skip any parts of a series, that's a good indicator that it's probably not worth watching. That also raises a red flag in terms of how ineffective somebody can be at storytelling. Anyway, this arc also attempts some character development with a staple character, but I really felt like it was forced or shoehorned in. At this point in the series, I had been on and off trying to continue the series, but I slowly began to dislike it the further I went along. Eventually, I got to episode 94 and after realizing a lot of the background characters were jumping in out of nowhere to remind us they exist and act as deus ex machinas, I decided that was the last straw and dropped the series for good. I really wanted to like this series. I truly did. I enjoyed it from the beginning, and the first series intro still gives me nostalgia whenever I see it (I would go as far as saying the first intro is one of my favorite anime intros ever; I still love it to this day). But after being really promising at the beginning, the series really drops the ball when the actual story begins, and everything goes from being carefully planned out to being improvised rather poorly as time passes. Something else that always bothered me a bit about the series is the ending themes. The filler episodes at the beginning usually end on a cheery or satisfactory note, and then the ending theme is a rather sad song ""Life Is Like A Boat"". Nothing wrong with the song since I liked it, but then later during the Soul Society Arc, the juxtaposition becomes much worse and less appropriate. Several episodes during the Soul Society Arc end on dreadful cliffhangers, and the ending theme is ""HAPPY PEOPLE"", an upbeat and lively pop-ish song about being happy. Doesn't really do a good job adding to the atmosphere. Characterization is flawed as I mentioned above for having too many characters to focus on. As a result, Ichigo, the protagonist, shows little to no development, or he develops it so slowly that it doesn't matter. He develops adequately enough during the initial filler episodes as far as anime standards go, but once the Soul Society Arc begins, he becomes the walking embodiment of the generic ""get more powerful and beat them"" cliche. Any character development during the story arcs I've seen is often minimalized to give more time to lesser characters. In other words, the characterization isn't so bad, but it's just spread far too thin. So closing thoughts, the music and sound were okay in the series, but I found a lot of it forgettable or just good enough. The art is adequate, but nothing to really make your jaw drop in awe.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3f55e72d49,5
"Bleach, yea after watching this that's what I want right now, a big bottle of bleach so I can wash some of my clothes and try to get my mind of this train wreck. Bleach is nothing but a dubious shire twisting down a landscape of softened pathways. Do you really wanna watch bleach? I mean do you? I would like to think if you are into anime to the point of being on this site you would be aware of much better shows. The characters, you know what they have such little character that they shouldn't be called characters, the connected lines in the shape of bodies with mouths that move during dialogue are horrible abominations with very little development or personality. After 23232 episodes Ichigo could get decapitated and I wouldn't give a fuck, I barely knew the guy. He was a kind of a delinquent with a good heart? He cares about his friends? He was a 27 year old that's still in school for some reason and has no interests in life? that's about all I have on him, I don't even know why he cares about his friends they never seem like they have any fun with each other when their not in danger. They are all just kind of stoned face with nothing to talk about or convey. Characters that are upbeat or tough or whatever are just one note unless they are worried about something in battle. The story should be cool, the premise is sounds good but I just never end up caring because whats really at risk? oh no kurashitface town and the rest of their awful world might be consumed by hollows, who cares? They need to kill off 90 percent of the cast, maybe have a twist and reveal Ichigo was a mega chocolate hollow sent from the future to kill all humans, and have a slice of life subplot with Rukia and Rangiku that goes all yuri. The fights are cool I guess, when they have them, I thought Nel and the Espadas were boss. The whole show has a pretty cool atmosphere and the soundtrack is good, it's watchable just really boring. If you are still reading this go read hunter x hunter or watch the 2011 anime, support that shonen not this fucking garbage, like seriously have you seen hunter x hunter? What the hell right? So good its from the dude that made YuYu Hakusho, like even if you despise everything I've wrote go watch hunter x swagger it is orgasmic.

"I've decided to rewrite some of my reviews since my other's were more opinions then reviews. There may be spoilers involved so if you haven't finished the show yet, then you've been warned. I said their may be spoilers because I'm basically typing what I say, so don't troll me if my grammar is off. Anyway's, The Bleach series started out as any cliche Organization Vs Evil Things does ( Such as in D Grey Man, Soul Eater, Trinity Blood, Etc) and doesn't really start to get interesting until around episode 16 or 17. If you enjoy action over other genres and are willing to sacrifice having a Tolerable story to get it, then this is the show for you. This rather generic anime has some of the most intense fights in anime, which is perfect for those who watch anime for the fight scenes. I'll use the order of the rating system to review the show and others I might decide to review, So let's begin. First up for judgement is the Bleach story line. In my experience of the show the story was good up to the end. As I stated, the show didn't really start to get interesting until episode 17 were they travel to soul society. From their the story progressively gets better, Fights get more epic and powers become ridiculous. At the end of the soul society arc your left with some questions, as to be expected, and instead of giving answers they give fillers. The Bleach series was riddled with them, popping up when you just want to find out what happens next. I got sick of fillers and searched for a filler list so I could skip them. Without them the show was a little more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the ending of the main story was rather dreadful and quite frankly left the feeling of chewing on razor blades and using lemon juice as mouth wash afterwards. Sorry if that last phrase was more opinion then review material, but I was quite furious with everything that happened after Ichigo fights Ulquiorra. Next is art, Which was the best part of the show. The show was full of color and had an interesting array of special effects thrown in. The shows art style changes as it progresses, representing the advancements the studio is making towards more fluent animations. The fight scenes are Bleach's specialty and they certainly deliver. The way it seemed to work is that the show uses a lower budget anime style for the small engagements leading up to Kurosaki and his next boss fight ( Byakuya, Grimjow, Ulquiorra and Aizen). When those fights begin the animations become so flawless the you can't look away and so epic that you forget the color pink, the ability to transform into a cat elf thing and being emo aren't badass. As for Aizen turning into a butterfly? No wonder he wanted the world to end. His fight had spectacular animations even if lacking in movements. The field they were fighting on seemed to be more active then they were. Not much to say about the sounds, other the the fact that I loved the noise Cero makes when it's charging and then fired. The soundtrack was amazing as well, with my favorite song being Mysterious. The voice actors in the Japanese version were spectacular. I didn't watch the English version other then a couple episodes here and their for a comparison... Never watching dubbed anime again thanks to that ordeal. Now for character's. Ichigo is a decent enough protagonist. Aizen started out as an amazing antagonist. Other then that, there's way to many characters to review. Would have been nice if the story would kill some good guys off for once, you know, so the show doesn't feel so over populated. As for Aizens decline from amazing badass, well let me explain. When you first see Aizen he appears to be the only captain who gives a crap about the world, only to find that he's the one who triggered the events leading to Ichigo entering Soul Society. He appears to be a genius who is more then just an exceptional spell caster, but is extremely over powered and is prepared for every scenario. After he gets what he wanted and Beats a few captains to express his dominance he takes his glasses off and folds his hair back Clark Kent to Superman style and disappears into the world of the hollows. Unfortunately Kubo's writing ruined Aizen by taking his Foresight overboard. Having him state that all of ichigo's life has just been another one of his experiments. That he was aware of the boy from birth and had pushed Ichigo into all these situations to watch him progress to a stronger state. Then he turns into a butterfly and gets slaughtered by Ichigo in the completely one sided final battle. The show had a great deal of potential, but was lacking in almost every aspect. The concept of the Zanpakuto was very interesting and made for some nasty fight scenes. But I suppose it just wasn't my cup of tea, though I would rather watch every non fighting episode of this show then any episodes of DragonballZ. Keep in mind the I excluded everything after 310 cause as for as I'm concerned that's where the story should have ended. I give Bleach a 5 out of 10.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 10, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7a4c03687,6

Bleach is very well made and is quite popular. I find Bleach to be very entertaining but sadly I believe it is very overrated. The story is quite original to the core. Though it really is the same as all the other &quot;The good guys got to win&quot; scenario. The sound is quite amazing how to goes along so well with the series itself. The music &quot;intensives&quot; the fights and makes the series captivating. It really gives the series a push in the right direction. The artwork is very very well done. All of the characters and monsters are incredible. I love the mix of characterr design and the lighting and shading are remarkible. The characters are a mix of original and nonoriginal personalities. The original characters are great but I find it hard to enjoy a character personality thats been used mutliple times. This series is most enjoyable and a great introductory to non-anime fans.

"I started to watch Bleach some years ago, and it was the ""1st"" anime I seen (not counting with Pokémon, Dragon Ball, Yu-Gi-Oh and others who I watched as a kid in television). In my opinion, Bleach got a good story, where we can see a lot of characters with different opinions, own mentality and personality, based on friendship and trust on each other, and a plot based on a battle of ""good against the evil"". As the story progresses, we notice that the course changes and the own opinion of the viewer can change too and shapes itself according to the appreciation of the anime itself. The 1st episode was an awesome entrance to the anime, where it shows the good and the bad guys of the story, the main characters, the abilities of each other, and the type of anime it will become forward. As the story progresses, it start to enter an enormous variety of characters, which is difficult at the start the record all of them, but as it goes on, we can relate the characters with their occupations and positions. Of course the anime cannot relate the full biography of all of that secondary personages, or it will be impossible to continue the story, but we got the essential of each one of them. With that, each viewer can get more related with one char than others, where we discover some badasses and others who are more reserved and closed. The music and soundtracks are well played, as the state of mind of the characters, the battles, or just when some new power is discovered. The battles are in fact one major theme in Bleach. We can see a lot of moves and understand the strength and the speed of each one of them. The graphics are very good, and there are many meanings behind each confrontation. As the episodes goes on, so the duration and force goes up as well. There also some negative parts in Bleach. One big fail (in my opinion of course) is the fact that there is too much fillers that run parallel to the main story, and that is a mainline problem that leads to that people hate this anime (in 366 eps, about 150 are fillers? It's an enormous waste!). Or u can also explain that in factors like "" financial issues "", or even ""it's made for the fans"". I really think that these excessive fillers spoiled a lot! The ambiance will vary enough, which have very heavy climates, and can quickly jump to a joyful moment, comic, or even stupid moment. It appears a lot. Another point I can add is the love/hate relationship I have with the main character. Ok, Kurosaki Ichigo goes to an almost normal student with orange hair who can see ghosts, to a baddass human who got shinigami, hollow, fullbringer and quincy powers, reached the maximum power output of any living been, like a God or something like that, and just for saving the ones who he loves (in other words, everyone he knows or has just met 2 seconds ago). One last thing: the story develops around a gigantic battle against two or more super powers (Shinigamis, Hollows, and you can also add the Vaizards), who finishes in a almost extermination of the enemy. The ""good"" side finishes with 0 deaths (everyone ""almost"" died, one old man lost an arm, and a dude lose [temporarily] is powers). Seems legit. At the end, I say that after all, I loved the anime. The fact that it was my 1st can influence my taste, but I still recommend it. If you can watch it without the fillers it will make it better, but you are a fan or you based on a rule that you only watch from the beginning to the end, go for it.",8,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_cca11e8c9f,6
"The story of a a young man becoming a soul reaper, or an arch angel in a sense, who becomes one of the protectors of a town filled with violent ghosts and vampires is every kid's dream. Truly intoxicating. The action sequences that are involved with this show call for a great amount of talent as well as hard work to contain the large scale effects that this series uses - a feat not easily reached. But Bleach pulls it off. The sheer destruction and ominous tones this series employs requires some serious attention to detail, but it is reached at a enjoyable standpoint, and is even breathtaking at points. Ichigo, a young man who stands up for what he believes in and fights the good fight to his last breath, is an inspiration to all young men.

"Hmmm... bleach... what can i say?... It is a anime about shinigamis?... well, the storyline of bleach isn't very exciting, a 15 boy named kurosaki ichigo, suddenly one day, meets a shinigami, who gives him her powers, he then has to take on the role of a sub-shinigami, and fight ''hollows'' (another word for ''bad guys''... hold on a miniute. nothings really special... these type of storylines are kinda boring... Bleach gives a suprise now and then to viewers, which is what i call ''change of opinion... i sometimes rate the story 9/10, and other times its 2/10... often due to the stroy, i just switch to naruto... but most of the times, bleach has a pretty well standard storyline now the art... i'd say that the drawing in this anime Isn't bad. like the story, it changes between 10/10... to 5/10 they totally ruin the characters sometimes due to the way they look... oh, about the sound, i dont notice alot of difference, (i'm not very good with sound indicatence :) anyway i just love it when ichigo says ''BanKai!!!'' :) hehe... well thats me... :) I'd say this is what makes this anime's characters 10/10 in my opinion :) its ''I WANT TO FIND OUT'' part :) Enjoyment eah?, i gotta say its 8/10 not very enjoyble at some moments, but other moments makes me think I LOVE BLEACH!!! hehe Overall, this anime is recommanded by me for anyone to watch :) very fun and cool, its ok aslong as u skip some parts that u dont enjoy :) hehe Thanks for reading.

"this review is SPOILER FREE Story - 2 The narrative of Bleach is, in summary, a failure. The pacing of this show is god awful; and I even skipped the filler. The arcs were very generic and predictable, nothing noteworthy really. Now what is noteworthy, is how terrible the powerscaling in the show is. No show that I have seen has worse powerscaling than Bleach does. Without spoiling, mc beats a character in one arc, then he gets a big shounen power up, loses to someone in the next arc, and then the person that he beat in the previous arc shitstomps the person he lost to (without a big shounen power-up, mind you), this is not a one-time occurrence, it's frequent and happened not with just that one character but with multiple. People that lost to other people besides Ichigo also had similar things happen with them. Art/animation - 3 I know the show is older, and maybe I've been spoiled on more modern animation but it really is below average. Especially for a battle shounen. Older shounens, like the other 2 in the big three and dragon ball perhaps managed to deliver more appealing fight scenes than Bleach, i cannot say that I enjoyed watching a single one of them. As for the art itself, some of it was cool; but a lot of the character designs like for captains and arrancar were just copy and paste. Some characters had good designs and others had terrible designs. I would go further into that but that's spoiler territory right there Sound - 7 the openings are all pretty good, and there were a few bangers, same can be said about the OST. The OST had a few standout songs like Treachery, but it still wasn't anything crazy. The sound effects themselves were about average or maybe a little above, they weren't standout. Characters - 6 i found myself really enjoying a lot of the characters, but that's the key word; enjoying. I do not think a majority of the characters were well written, especially the main cast. All of the particularly charismatic characters were side characters or Chad (but he didn't do much and he wasn't particularly well written either). Back to why I claim that the characters were not well written; development was not handled with care and a lot of it felt rushed, and characters acted in ways that seemed really weird or forced. A score of 6 is simultaneously very generous for Bleach's characters but also a little bit of a letdown because some characters were genuinely cool and charismatic fellas that would've shined in a series with a better narrative. enjoyment - 2 I never understood what people meant by ""that show put me to sleep"" as I've never almost fallen asleep to a movie or show unless I was severely sleep deprived. However, watching this show i know what those people meant. That said, there were points where I found myself enjoying the show, and some of the characters, especially Urahara and Gin. But all of that aside, during my viewing of Bleach, I have never wanted to drop a show more, it was an absolute slog to get through; the only thing that kept me going was my desire to see the Thousand Year Blood War arc which looks amazing based on the production value. I also wouldn't particularly mind one episode of high-budget Bleach a week.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 25, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_007f4e1288,6

"I wrote this review when I was like 14. Please ignore everything. Im sure you will after reading ""Bleach remains one of my favorite mangas...."" anyways. Just dont bother with this series watch something good -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bleach remains one of my favorite mangas of all time, and I was excited to see it as an anime, but after finishing it, I wish I had just stuck with the manga. Lets start with story; Which the anime did a decent job of conveying from the manga, that is, when the anime CARED about the actual story. There is so much filler in the anime. There are entire filler arcs that completely de-rail the pacing of the rest of the show, adding filler characters that have their own filler back stories. FILLER INSIDE OF FILLER.The plot also moves at a snails pace in the anime, one issue of the manga boils to about 4 episodes at best. Some times it just feels like a chore to watch, but it has its moments.Overall, the story is very good with many, many, unexpected twists that you won't see coming, and a very satisfying ending, (I'm actively trying to forget anything happens after the fullbringer arc) Art and Sound; The animation is nothing special, very stereotypical stuff. Does nothing to shake up the formula, but doesn't really need to. As for the soundtrack, its very, VERY hit and miss. The beginning of the show hosts some great openings, decent at best endings, and at the time, a GREAT in show soundtrack. Notice how I said 'at the time'? Well it's true, in the beginning, every song seems so cool, but with 366 episodes and only 1 or 2 songs added in, the background music quickly gets repetitive and tedious,except for the series's ""signature song"" 'Number One', and it's many re-mixes Characters; Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Here we have Bleaches biggest downfall, the cast. While they're a certainly great, funny, relate-able, and bad-ass characters in bleach, their screen time is very lacking. The main cast that has most of the screen time are either 2cool4u edgemasters (like Ichigo, Renji, Byakuya, Rukia, the list goes on...) or just annoying as fuck charecters (KUROSAKI-KUN, KUROSAKI-KUN, KUROSAKI-KUN....) It's not a completely hateable cast, its a 50/50 draw of whether you will like a certain character or not. For the most part, you can put up with them, but it is by no means a solid cast. Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation; Bleach the Anime is very, very long. And in my opinion, the amount of enjoyment you get out of it vs the amount of time you put into it is not equal. It's so painfully average in everything it does while just being able to barely keep you enticed for the whole ride. My recommendation is that if you really want to experience bleach, just Sod the anime and read the manga. If you are hellbent on watching the anime, I would quit after the soul society arc, because it goes far downhill from there.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6a09689c44,6
"Where do I even start with my dear Bleach? Characters are one of the best if entire anime/manga world. Almost every of the major protagonist/villain character is different with unique traits and personality. Most of the cast is very likeable since their first apperance on screen. They are not only good or bad in 0/1 terms (they're not villains only because they are evil and that is the only reason), everyone has their own motivations and goals. Tite Kubo created a multilayered characters, which are main source of Bleach success. Every single antagonist in this series is very likeable. The designs of the villains instantly makes them looking badass and cool. OST is amazing with epic, thrilling themes. Those soundtracks are iconic and they're being well fitted into the show. Shiro Sagisu is an incredible talented person, hats off. The plot is interesting with a lot of plot twists and later revealings throughout the story progress. Artstyle is changing as fast as it was in the manga. The improvements between first episode and those only 20 after are big and it does not stop to evolve through the whole series. Voice acting is amazing. The voices of the cast are iconic and they match the personalities of the played role. One thing to say about the fillers being said as one of the biggest downside of the Bleach. You just don't need to watch them. We live in the modern times and there is simply no reason to don't check which episodes are skipable beacause they were just made to fill gaps between manga arcs in those times (so obviously they don't containt any signifant plot and are less quality ones from the first look). I can understand that an older Bleach TV viewer might got confussed that the story is boring because this arc is completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. They have no choice to avoid the non-manga episodes but now everyone has this opportiunity. The show itself obviously contains this big amount of more boring episodes but we have the knowledge to avoid them and enjoy the proper animation of the original work. Just don't watch the original studio products made to maintain the screentime in TV.",10,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5898725c46,6
"Had to write this review for my favourite Series. First of All bleach is that dish that you will either like it and became a fanboy for your whole life or you will hate it with core. While it may not be the case for everyone. First of All what is bleach? By reading the synopsis you be like: A samurai anime wow Another sword style anime oh While Bleach is said to be in big 3 it has lot less popularity compared to other big 3 members(naruto and one piece) but its just my opinion but i think bleach is better than both. Bleach is not a roller coaster of emotion like naruto or one piece or a extremely well written and crafted story like AOT. BELIEVE ME MAN its not either animation carrying show like demon slayer. So what the hell is bleach, why do i and so many people like this so much. Bleach is a fun ride of Great characters and well crafted plot . Pretty memeable and entertaining. Bleach is not just a shonen where it mc wants to achieve greater heights and excite or inspire the viewers. bleach main character ichigo don't want to be hokage pirate king etc. Or soul king in sense of this series. Ichigo's only goal is to protect his friends and family. He was chosen to be a special boy before his birth it was not his fate. He didn't have aspirations to become a soul reaper, my god he doesn't know what that mean before he became one. Ichigo kept fighting for his friends and family which makes him a likable character because he doesn't have his own sense of justice. Ichigo is not like other mcs who cry out loud their name, ambition, father name, mother name, aadhar card number everywhere. Bleach has so many unique and cool characters but you know why ichigo is still the most popular one. Because he is lovable he cares for people. He is the type of friend you wnat in real life or the type of person you wanna be. Enough about mc, let's talk about villian, this is a non spoiler review so i ain't gonna spoil the villan name to you but i must say this anime villian is the best villian of all time. Even though he is a great villian you will love him but you won't support his actions unless you are a edgy kid. That's what make him feel like a true villian. If we talk about technical things then This Anime adaptation isn't too great at start but picks up later on. If you are planning to watch this series then be sure to skip fillers one which adds no value to the story. If we talk about animation, then i think animation is weird at first but gets pretty awesome later on. The legendary art style +good animation adds the scene. The anime adaptation isn't perfect but worth a watch, you should read the manga too. I know you may think if the story is not good(as maybe others told you) and the animation is inconsistent why would i watch this? Well believe me story is great you have to feel it and understand it. Plus character designs are too good i'm sure you will love it and appreciate the authors drawings. Plus bleach has comedy sequences and its comedy is better than other big 3. So you should definitely watch this. Sayonara :)",9,Recommended,"Jan 27, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_075c07b056,6
"This was the first anime that I ever watched so speaking without bias gets a bit tough here. I really enjoyed bleach, the OSTs , sound, concept were really good especially in the first 2-3 arcs. I liked ichigo as the MC and rukia was good as the FMC, I did find a few of the captains of the soul society annoying tbh. Now speaking about the bad parts-it could have been better at some parts, people think the character development could have been better, which is understandable, although I might disagree with that. If anything I feel the final arcs could have been done better and there was this one time where they showed a cool fight and then immediately showed an alt. arc which bewildered me tbh. It was sad that kubo's relationship with the higher-ups kinda spoiled it at the end, and somewhat similar case with the manga, where his health worsened, Do i reecd this series? surely, but be ready to face the consequences of what I told above",9,Recommended,"Jul 23, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9ee6ce8598,6
"Bleach is one of the most popular anime of all, is this why you should watch it? not really, bleach has too many good points and too many bad points despite that it is a story worth watching Story: The story of bleach is simple shinigamis vs hollows, but the more the story progresses, the more will be discovered, new races, new powers, and better construction, in fact bleach has one of the best sagas of the neketsu, also it has some arcs a little slow already Sometimes it seems that the story will not advance but with its lots of plot twists it makes it enjoyable, it may remind you a little of Yu Yu Hakusho with the theme of spirits, but Bleach has a unique style that no other anime has. One of the biggest problems with bleach is that the story often focuses too much on its protagonist, but many times secondary and villains are also given importance so it is not so bad. Another big problem that is not the fault of bleach, but of the pierrot company, is its massive filler, there are filler arcs of 40 episodes in a row and it was one of the great bleach problems, its first filler arc is lousy and boring but it was put just after the end of a great saga so the weather was not so bad, which did not do his next two arcs, which put in the middle of sagas or important moments damaging the whole experience, his final arc is very good and was put in a good moment but the error of the other arches is incredible so much that it helped its cancellation, so although these arches have moments that are worth it and the last arc is great with great animation they were a great damage for the fans by bleach. As several nekketsu follow a known formula, so comedy and ecchi are expected, in terms of comedy bleach stands out, it has very funny moments around the whole series thanks to good characters who contribute it, but although it has comedy they do not put it in serious moments or important moments for the plot so it is very enjoyable, in terms of ecchi it is debatable for each person, personally I do not like ecchi since it seems unnecessary in an anime and bleach despite having ecchi are very few scenes, and for the large number of episodes it is not felt to bother. The mystery is present in bleach and is very well handled especially in its second and last arc, it keeps you aware of what is happening and then everything changes with a great plot twist, this is very exciting when you see it for the first time and not know nothing that happens If we talk about problems in bleach, it may be that it has several deux machina that damage the anime a lot, that sometimes things are resolved because yes, because a new power came out, like in lots of nekketsu, there are two great ones that I will not speak for spoilers but yes they are a big mistake And to end the story, there is no spoiler that bleach was canceled, because of this it is not the same ending that exists in the manga, despite this I think it is a nostalgic ending for all the people who see it, they leave the Possibility of a new sequel, and although it is more like a season finale than a series finale, it can be considered a good and endearing ending. Art: This is one of the strongest points of bleach, the character design is incredible and unique, no bleach character looks alike and there are a lot of characters, tite kubo's style is unique and has given bleach great recognition. The animation studio, although it could not match the incredible art of tite kubo, did a great job considering the studio that it is, there are great battles with very good choreographies and throughout the series the animation was improving showing its highest level right in the last Stand. Scenarios such as the society of souls and las noches are very recognized, even the design is incredible and nothing like it has been seen. Sound: This is undoubtedly one of the best bleach points the voice actors of bleach are quite good, they do an excellent job, they really convey the feelings of the scenes, the screams the powers are acted in an incredible way The bleach ost are simply a masterpiece, the bleach music is incredible ost like senna is extremely epic, and they are always put at the right moments, not to mention their openings that all are not incredible, highlighting the 13, the 12 and the 2, and endings as the last one with which the series was dismissed. character Bleach has an incredible number of characters, not only human, spirits and other races, it is a very large universe, and although the variety is good, it is a great bleach problem, due to the immense number of characters, there are very few characters that they have a good development or contribute to the plot, it is undoubtedly the biggest problem with bleach, even so it has endearing and very good characters, starting with the main villain who is also considered one of the best in anime without a doubt bleach has quite a few memorable characters Enjoyment I think that people who see bleach are going to enjoy it a lot, in addition to that if they do not like the filling there are several pages to skip it, even so it is very enjoyable, of course if you like nekketsu genre animes you will enjoy much more, fights, action and blood, I would see it again but for scenes since the anime is quite long, I would still enjoy it again to relive fights and memorable scenes, so bleach despite the years has too many fans who love the series In conclusion, I highly recommend bleach, it is an anime that despite its declines has very high points, it is worth seeing it at least once you will enjoy this great story a lot, which I raise a point for the love I have for it, even with what bad bleach is amazing",9,Recommended,"Jul 3, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b384091f41,6
"SKIP FILLERS! Enjoy main story. SKIP all the fillers, no exceptions. Bleach is an excellent anime with immense potential, but unfortunately, that potential is squandered by the filler episodes. Bleach is almost on par with the original Naruto. But the animation studio, driven by greed and a lack of creativity, decided to exploit Bleach. The result? A whopping 50% of the series is filled with unnecessary low IQ filler episodes. These fillers not only make the characters seem less intelligent and useless, but also made storyline unatractive. The filler stories are nothing short of garbage. Fillers backstab the essence of Bleach, turning the entire anime experience into something questionable and senseless.

"Bleach as an anime is mediocre at best. The concept is great but the execution is extremely lacking. The early episodes have fairly poor animation, and I didn't feel that the anime was even remotely good until around episode 270, but at that point it was still only a /decent/ anime. There's a huge power-scaling problem with the characters, and the fillers are horrible. Bleach has a higher filler:canon ratio than Naruto does (at the time of writing this review). While one may dislike Naruto fillers (I personally like them due to the following reason), at least Naruto fillers almost always add to character development and the story. You can even look at them as canon if you so wish. Bleach filler is fairly low quality with plot holes. Bleach fillers also add zero character development, and to top it off, most of Bleach's full filler arcs do not actually have a place in the Bleach universe (they physically cannot have happened in the past or happen in the future). The arcs also come around at the most inopportune times (i.e. a full 30 episode filler arc unrelated to the story between two consecutive fights in a canon arc). The anime's story is very linear. I felt as though it was being written day-to-day rather than planned out. ""Okay, this person's going to win this fight; let's make it happen."" I honestly didn't get the feeling that any sort of deep thought had gone into the anime until after 310 wherein it's mostly filler from then until 366. Many anime can provide certain levels of ""hype"" during a big fight. Whenever Bleach presents such a moment, it's extremely short lived. The ""final"" fight gave me the most ""hype,"" which only lasted MAYBE two minutes. I don't find any of the soundtracks to be worth returning to. I occasionally listen to some of the openings and endings, but the overall soundtrack is relatively unimpressive. I enjoy Bleach's character design and wide range of characters, and it was ""entertaining,"" to say the literal most. I gained very little from this anime besides adding 366 episodes to MyAnimeList.

"Bleach is the ultimate delusion. You may take a look at the average rating for this show and think ""Hey, this show must not be that bad. I'll give it a watch."" I am posting this review to warn you ahead of time: those reviews are not for Bleach in its entirety. Let me explain. I, like many others, got hooked by Bleach in its first season. In fact, I should state now that if you're only interested in watching the first three seasons you'll probably come away feeling pretty happy. Up to that point, the show is stellar. It's fast-paced, full of interesting characters and has a great story set in a fascinating setting. If this were a review for the first three seasons, I would be offering glowing praise. Unfortunately, Bleach is a lot longer than three seasons. A lot longer. And that's where the torture begins. It's like buying a new tv that's amazing for a while and then explodes in your living room or making a good friend who takes you out to lunch and jokes with you about everything before leaving you tied up behind a dumpster while they clean out your apartment. After the first three seasons, the writing nosedives very hard. And it isn't just bad, it's distinctly bad. It's clear that whoever is writing this trash has no idea where it's headed and is hoping and praying that no one will notice by flooding the script with as many characters as possible. Oh but it doesn't stop there. In writing, there is an idea referred to as ""setup and payoff"". This is the notion that something in a story can be set up for the reader to be resolved at a later time. For example, in Star Wars: A New Hope it could be Luke learning the ways of the force and by the end of Return of the Jedi, mastering the force. A good setup leaves the audience intrigued yet mystified, wondering how something will resolve. And a good payoff is that moment where the setup is satisfied and all the loose ends are tied up. Bleach is the textbook example of what NOT to do with setups and payoffs. The thoughtlessness that went into writing Bleach is kind of amazing: it has a very rare distinction of dumping so many setups on the audience that I actually lost track. I had to be reminded by others watching the show of numerous other plotholes I hadn't even considered. Oh and before you ask ""Did they payoff all those setups?"" I will remind you that this review is scored very low for a reason. Every rule is broken. Every character is ultimately meaningless. Every relationship develops no one. By the end of the series, it becomes painfully obvious how much time has been wasted, not just by the audience, but by the architects of this train wreck. The only possible satisfaction I can imagine that anyone would derive would be due to the character designs. Maybe it could be a springboard for fanfiction. I can't imagine any fanfiction would be worse than this. I'm giving the story a 2 because I can't overlook the first three seasons (which were very well done). The animation was highly inconsistent and it was extremely obvious when the studio was spending more or less money on their episodes. The soundtrack was compelling (again, for the first three seasons) and then just became reused and rehashed everywhere they could think of. By the end it was just annoying. For those who don't know, the manga continued on after the show finished. You might ask: why did the show stop then? As the show progressed, it became obvious how painful it must've been for the studio to keep making this swill every week. The animation suffered hard, the voice actors stopped trying and it was generally clear that no one really cared about Bleach anymore (both those making it AND viewing it). They decided to finally stop pumping it full of whatever it took to keep it alive and let it die. It should've died about 250 episodes before that but better late than never. It's very sad because Bleach had tremendous potential. To take something so good and run it so hard into the ground is painful. It didn't have to turn into such garbage. Overall, Bleach was a phenomenal waste of my time and I wrote this review as a warning to others. If this review was too long to read or you just want the gist, it's this: the first 3 seasons are great and worth watching and everything else after is just filler. NOTE: This is not a review of the manga. I haven't wanted to risk finding out if the source text is as bad as what spawned from it. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I have decided to add an addendum for all the things wrong with Bleach that I could think of, just to emphasize the point of how badly this show lost its way. 1) The relationship between Rukia and Ichigo. In the beginning of the story, it's complex and interesting. You can't really tell if they're just really good friends or if there's a bit more between them. Whatever it is, it's endearing and special. However, after Soul Society, their relationship is completely ignored and they barely have any useful interactions. By the end of the ACTUAL last season (not the filler-like ""manga canon"" last season with Xcution), the fact that Ichigo would not see Rukia again doesn't matter at all. 2) Bleach introduces three totally useless characters during the protagonist's trip to Hueco Mundo: Nel, Porsche and Dummychaka. They clearly exist for no other reason than to add humor yet they consume an immense amount of screen time. By the end, their purpose is still unclear as they seemingly vanish and no one ever brings them up again. 3) Perhaps the most egregious of Bleach's failures is that of Aizen. Let's go over ALL the problems with Aizen: 3a) Here's a guy who seemingly tricked everyone into believing he's a good guy because of the power of his zanpakuto. Then it turns out a bunch of captains from a hundred years prior figured out how bad he was (including Urahara). But for some reason none of them thought it would be useful information to share with anyone because present-day Soul Society still has no clue that he's bad news. Oh yeah and Urahara seems to think that information is useless to share with Ichigo when he's training him for Soul Society, the place WHERE AIZEN IS. 3b) The one blind guy who can't have been affected by Aizen's hypnosis follows him willingly. Wow, cool, interesting. Why does he do that? Is he really tricking Aizen and waiting for a chance to strike when his guard is down? Nope! He's just blind. And he randomly becomes an angry monster at the end and dies. Probably the grossest misuse of setup and payoff in this entire disaster of a show. 3c) Ichigo, it turns out, is the ONLY person that hasn't seen Aizen's released zanpakuto and thus isn't affected by his hypnosis. Therefore, he's the only one that can save the day. The fourth captain warns him ahead of time: don't look at his zanpakuto! So what does Ichigo do? Look at it. A lot. Does it make any difference? Nope. Does Aizen's fall have anything at all to do with Ichigo seeing through his hypnosis? Nope. It's totally irrelevant. 3d) Aizen has this extremely powerful hypnosis ability. It makes everyone see what he wants them to see. But he decides to show his hand to everyone instead of maintaining that illusion. Why? Who knows. Maybe it's because he doesn't need that ability at all because his spiritual power is through the roof. 3e) Aizen has no backstory. What's that you say? The main antagonist for the ENTIRE SHOW has no backstory? Yes, that's right. There's none. Not one time do we ever get any motivation for Aizen's actions. He's just a bad dude who's smart enough to trick everyone but not smart enough to keep tricking everyone. Considering that pretty much every single meaningless character who shows up gets a backstory, this is a pretty major oversight. 3f) Why was it important for Ichigo to progress? Aizen said he'd been spying on Ichigo for pretty much his whole life. He said that he carefully planned it out so that Ichigo would progress the way he did. Okay cool - so why? We never find out why. No really. Bleach never tells us why. Maybe he's just a voyeur. 4) Orihime's kidnapping in Hueco Mundo was pointless. They said they were interested in her powers then said forget it. 5) Orihime's powers were regarded as extraordinary by the bad guys. Then they said forget it. 6) Orihime is shown the Hogyoku. Why? Who knows. Then she says ""Cool, I'm gonna help the good guys with this knowledge."" Then doesn't and says forget it. 7) Orihime loves Ichigo. She thinks he's the bees knees. They have touching moments together, one where she says goodbye to him while he sleeps and others where he's making himself stronger for her. But by the end none of this matters at all because Orihime and Ichigo just go on with their lives. 8) In the last season Chad becomes a completely different character. He starts yelling a lot and throwing fits. 9) Ichigo beats these powerful captains in Soul Society (Kenpachi and Byakuya) but then can't fight anything without needing his internal hollow yet those same captains seem to have no problem destroying Espada (which are supposedly much more powerful than captains). 10) The Visored are pointless. They need Ichigo (why?) and then when he leaves from them they don't care. What have they been doing in exile for the last hundred years? Sitting in that warehouse? Clearly not telling anyone about Aizen despite knowing what happened. Did the Visored have any effect on the final battles? Nope. 11) For that matter, Xcution is just the Visored again. They even have a stereotypical angry loud girl. Tsukishima is Aizen. Same quiet and outwardly nice manner. Same manipulation of people's interpretation of events. I guess they're all different because they're drawn different. 12) Also Xcution had no effect on Ichigo getting his powers back. If Ichigo had sat around and picked his nose for a week, Soul Society would've given him his powers back anyway. Xcution had no relevance to anything at all. 13) If you thought Dragonball Z fights were drawn out, you haven't seen anything yet. Bleach masters this in a way that DBZ can't even come close to. I have watched much anime but have never been quite as miserable and bored and desperate for it to end as during the Hueco Mundo incursion. 14) Ichigo's dad and Ishida's dad know each other. How? Why? Who knows. 15) During the Hueco Mundo fight with Ulquiorra above the sky, Ishida states in a narrative that looking back, he should've never taken Orihime up there and regretted it. Why? 16) During the first three seasons (around the time they finally leave Soul Society), no one can fly. Bleach realizes that it's not DBZ and that it doesn't have to have flying characters. After the first three seasons they completely forget this rule, everyone can fly and it's never explained. 17) It is established early on in the show that those who live in Soul Society don't age. Then whoever writes this crap decided that was too hard to keep consistent and allowed aging (like Gin who apparently was a child and then grew up). 18) Speaking of ripping off DBZ, Bleach also busted out the time chamber. They needed some excuse for Ichigo to train for a long period of time so he could triumph over Aizen. Unfortunately, it made absolutely no sense. See, they trained in this place between worlds and could do so because this thing (a ""sweeper"") had been destroyed so they could. Except for the problem that it had already been established that the sweeper came only once a week so why couldn't anyone go in there and train for 6 days? Given the show's explanation that 1 hour in the real world is equivalent to 2,000 hours in that place, 6 days would've been an immense amount of training for anyone. Oh and why does Isshin know about this? Well, we don't know why, because... 19) Isshin has NO BACKSTORY. The father of the main protagonist turns out to be an ex-shinigami. Urahara sees this and mentions something like ""oh, you got your powers back."" Back? What happened? Why does Isshin wear a tattered captain's cape? Was he a captain? I don't know. No one does. Because Bleach is actually a prank played on those who were stupid enough to follow along. As someone who watched every episode, I can admit I was duped. That's all I can think of now. tl;dr - this show sucks a lot.",2,Not Recommended,"Jul 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bb91aec619,6
"This is one anime I started and finished a long time ago. I spent a lot of time keeping up with the upcoming episodes since the series was ongoing for such a long time. I don't remember every detail of it, but I do remember enjoying it a lot, and it is one of those series where yo could watch 30 episodes in one day and still want more. you see the main character and his friends grow stronger, and mature together as the story goes, and there is always a cliff hanger after every episode that keeps you hungry for the next one. Overall this series is among my favorites, the story is divided in arcs or seasons if you want to call it that, and they're all a different story yet its all connected making it a huge 366 episode story. the music was among my favorite things in this series, it was catchy and engaging and felt very good, the art its its own, very well done. The characters all develop differently and some more than others. there are so many important characters in the series that makes it even more impressive at how they all are developed, I read a review saying they didn't do a good job on the characters but I would have to disagree. The amount of characters this series have. They're are all important and every single one haves a background and a reason to do what they do. on characters I would have to say they did a very good job. and now I will explain why this series is an 8 for me and not the perfect 10. and my 1 and only reason would be filler episodes. Filler episodes took so much from the main story. my recommendation to someone who has not yet started the series, and is looking for a series full of action, is to skip the filler episodes as they come up. some fillers take several episodes and some of those are actually not bad, but some of them can be completely stupid and really take away from the exciting moments of the main story. Pros: Long story to keep you entertained for a very long time, full of action that gets better as the story progresses, many characters with very individual personalities that can appeal to any watcher, amazing action music, and not to mention the opening and closing songs used are Extremely appealing, and some you will most likely love to download them. great art and animation of powers. an overall action packed series that will excite you every episode (non filler) Cons: series took a long time to finish but since it finally finished it is no longer a con. and the real con, Filler episodes that thew off the main story and character development. know that these fillers can be skipped, making this one of the best series out there!

"To tell the truth I was really skeptical at first cause I find Bleach is considered one of ""the three mainstreem animes"" ( along with One piece and Naruto). And personally I tend to not like them, but considering I was wrong about Naruto (which is now a fav) I decided to give it a try. The story is very interesting cause it's basically genious, you don't get tired of it cause the longer the serie progresses the more deep the plot gets and it's filled with interesting twists. I easily get bored, but let me tell you so far Bleach has managed to keep my interest. If you like animes with wicked fighting, truly interesting characters mixed together with humour but also seriousness this is defenitly for you! My favorite aspects of the serie are the characters, the fighting and basically the story! I really have to give it a 10 but because it's defenitly one of the best series I've ever watched. I do have a bit of a problem when it comes to the fillers, but don't get me wrong there's not that much fillers in Bleach if one were to compare it to Naruto. And even the fillers are enjoyable. Have fun watching! NOTE: these are my own opinions based on what I feel and think, they may be the complete oposite of the readers.

"I don't get why people hate Bleach. Seriously, Bleach has got to be one of the best anime around! I hope this review can give you a better view of Bleach and give it another chance. For those who whine and complain that Bleach is full of fillers, you are not wrong. However, you can easily skip these if you know which episodes are fillers and which are the real story. The first arc, The Soul Society arc is arguably the most exciting. This arc is from episode 1-63. In this arc, Ichigo and his friends attempts to save Rukia, a shinigami who has once saved Ichigo's family from danger and shared her (Shinigami) powers with Ichigo. Here a lot of interesting characters are introduced from the Gotei 13 (The Thirteen Protection Squads). The Gotei 13 serves to protect the Soul Society. Each squad has a captain and vice-captain (lieutenant). Captains are highly superior and very much respected and admired by their subordinates for their strength and power. Ichigo and his pals are labelled ryoka (intruders) by the Soul Society. Regardless, they proceed fight after fight to save Rukia, battling powerful opponents, including some of the captains. After the first arc, we enter the Bount arc, an anime-exclusive arc which has no relevance to the manga by Tite Kubo. Skip the Bount arc, trust me,and everything would be perfect:) This arc is from episode 64-109. As far as I'm concerned, this arc is filler stuff, so I skipped it. Now, this Hueco Mundo arc or Arrancar arc, is where Bleach picks up its pace from where it left off at the Soul Society arc. One of the captains, Aizen betrayed Soul Society and retrieved the Hyogoku, a powerful item which he used to create an army of Arrancars (modified Hollows which have Shinigami powers). This arc focuses mostly on Aizen and his Arrancars at a place called Hueco Mundo. The Arrancars are divided into several levels, the strongest one being the Espada. An Espada's strength is said to be equal or stronger than a captain's. Ichigo and the others are overwhelmed by the Espada's powers, which are stronger than anything they've fought before. After suffering heavy defeat, everyone trains desperately to improve themselves and prepare for the upcoming battle against the Arrancar. In the midst of everyone's training, Orihime (one of Ichigo's friend) is captured by Ulquoirra (an Espada) under Aizen's command, after Aizen realised Orihime's unique powers which might benefit him and his plan to overthrow Soul Society. The Hueco Mundo/ Arrancar arc is from episode 110-167. Take note that they are several filler episodes here, from episode 128-135. These filler episodes are not connected to the original plot or storyline in any way, so it's best to be skipped. If you have stuck with reading my review until here, I sincerely thank you. At the time of this review, I have watched Bleach until episode 167. Take note that episode 168-189 is also filler stuff. In short, Bleach is just amazing. You can easily get so carried away by the story and fall in love with the characters. Bleach is a perfect blend of action and comedy with a hint of romance. The fight scenes are awesome and exciting to watch! Lastly, I would like to give my praise to Tite Kubo, the person who created Bleach and to Noriyuki Abe, TV Tokyo, Dentsu and Studio Pierrot for producing the anime Bleach.",10,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9131b84ee8,7
"From sword clashing ding dangs, to sparks flying, to... atomic bombs. Oh how it tears me up to see little delinquent Ichigo grown up to be a true hero. Following the series since 2006, I've supported Bleach as one of my favorite animes all these years. However, it saddens me to see how the our generation of audience has grown up while the anime still remains ""youthful"" as ever. Don't get me wrong, I still love it to bits, but I laugh at the naivety of the overall development. Story: 6 More than 300 episodes already, still the same old fighting minons, then fighting the ultimate boss. I have lost count of how many times Ichigo was near death or should have died from fatal blows. From fighting fellow shinigamis to fighting ex-shinigamis to hollows to ex-hollows to fighting their swords to fighting themselves.... nice twists (so predictable) Art: 8 The art has evolved, thank god. It looks much more sleek and smooth from Saving Rukia Arc. I got to admit, the ""atomic bombs"" (aka. getsuga tensho) Ichigo produces in ep 339 really pumps adrenaline in my veins. Notice how the character appearance changed and improved since the beggining, especially Ichigo with his more handsome face. Rumor has it this is because of a shift in target of audience from pure shonen to attracting female audience as well. Sound: 7 I really liked almost all of the openings and endings, I can see the developers put a lot of thought into the first impression, which is the opening, of the anime. The music all suited the theme of Bleach very well: exciting, upbeat and a bit wild like Ichigo's hollow form ;) The OST always bring up nostalgic feelings from when I watched Bleach as a tween. However, it's unfortunate to say there's absolutely no change in OST for the past 6+ years. It's almost funny how the OST from Bount arc pops up when fighting arrancars. Character: 9 The character designs are pretty amazing: from the hair, to the eyes, to the costumes to the personaities; out of the countless supporting characters, it is almost impossible to find two characters that I will mix up. There are also many characters that I adore because of their personality and design, like Grimmjow, Byakuya and Hitsugaya. The only thing that I'm not satisfied about is the character development. I have mentioned earlier Ichigo's powers went beyond godly with atomic bombs with a single slash. And he is much more mature since the beggining. But what about others? Rukia? Same helpless kid, even with her awesome zanpaktou. Orihime? You would think after the experience with Ulquiorra that she'd be more useful and grown up. Instead she just sits there and sees her comrades getting slashed up without ANY thought of, "" hey, maybe it's time for my godly healing powers that can even bring back the dead.""-.- Enjoyment: 7 My eyes were glued to the screen before when I watched the epic battles like fights with the espadas. But now, I giggle at the most wrong spots. Why? Because it's so cliche and predictable. I'm sure the protagonists won't have a easy win EVER, and the enemy will strike back, almost killing them all. And I'm positive that no matter what the state of Ichigo's health is, he will get up and beat the crap out of the boss. But then again, it's always nice to see atomic bombs, earthquakes and flying people. Overall: 7 This score is the absolute lowest I can give to my once-upon-a-time favorite anime. (I have sentimentlal ties to the soul society and its shinigamis.) OF COURSE I STILL HAVE HOPES FOR IT! I'll keep thinking that the anime will make me mind blown once more.",7,Recommended,"Jan 26, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_94e543f47f,7
"TOO MANY FILLERS!!! Story: 6/10 I don't know how some hard core anime fans watch an anime like Bleach. A story that starts out fantastically but takes WAY too many twists and turns. I loved the first couple episodes the most. Art: 7/10 I thought the art was decent and the fighting scenes were pretty badass. Sound: 7/10 The music was beautiful like Will of the Heart. Bleach had many good opening theme songs as well. Character: 7/10 I loved Ichigo's brave character, loved Rukia's strong female character, didn't like Orihime much.. Enjoyment: 5/10 The fillers became so much of a distraction that I gave. I loved the beginning of the anime.

"I'm going to go ahead and start this review out by saying one thing: I have no idea where the hype came from with this anime. This anime is nothing more than basic. I would rarely find any enjoyment out of this, and after so many seasons of saying ""If I gave up on it now, something enjoyable will happen sooner or later will happen,"" I ran out on my hope. First of all, the filler episodes are not needed. Rarely are you going to find enjoyment out of a 366 episode anime. If you'd rather not waste time watching the anime but still want to say you wanna, I guess, ""ride the Bleach train"" (weird way of putting it), I'd recommend the manga. It's much more enjoyable and there are barely any dull moments. After so many episodes, they would play the same sounds over and over again. If you're going to make 366 episodes, switch out the music every now and then. Also, I guess I didn't get far enough to really dig into any character development. I mean, I heard that Ichigo changed a lot (and don't get me wrong, he's definitely babe), but other than that, I don't know. As said before, the enjoyment was decent. Me giving a 5 overall was me being generous. There's nothing more to say about this anime. I wish I could say something else good besides saying there was some humor in it, but I can't. Hopefully someone out there found this anime entertaining. Still confused as to why it ranks #6.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 22, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd13b76aef,7
"Bleach is a mixed bag, I'd love to give it a 8 for the first 63 Episodes which where really good, with a bit too long fights though. They could've easily made bleach a 36 EP Anime and I might have given it a 9 for being pretty amazing. But they didn't. If you want to watch bleach then enjoy the first arc, the first 63 EPs and stop it. I don't know how many of the 360 EPs are fillers, but my guess is 50% or more. In This Anime there are actually only 2 Arcs that matter and those two are the first 1-63 and the second stretched around the next 300 Episodes filled with endless flashbacks and side stories no one cares about. The second story arc isn't really bad to start with, the main problem is it's endless length and that is interrupted with many many fillers that don't really contribute to the story in any way and flashbacks that tell the story of gaining ability XY to finish that enemy off. Worst of all seems to be the pacing, if there aren't fillers or flashbacks, then there are fights that are fought not only one episode, but 3-10 episodes! How do they manage this? Easy! They give you a summary of what happened before in every episode, that summary is so long that about 10 minutes including the intro are not contributing to the story at all... If bleach where a 63 Episodes Anime, it would have been great. But it isn't, the first 63 EP deserve at least an 8/10 the rest a 2/10 - on average it should have been a 5 but honestly after watching 330(or so I don't really know) EPS to see the second(and final) arc ending, I can't rate it anything higher than 3.",3,Not Recommended,"May 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ab7d738c00,7
"First of all I'd like to thank my friend who suggested I watch Bleach. Because although I have been really into anime lately, but Bleach might just make an otakou outta me. Also, I'm really new to this and I have no idea how to write a proper review, so bear with me 😅 Bleach is probably the longest anime I'll ever watch, but it will always be the closest to my heart. That's why I decided to leave a review for the first time. Characters: 10/10 Every character was so unique and I'm really amazed by Kubo's insane ability to create this number of distinct characters with different personalities and looks. Ichigo is the probably one of the best MCs, his personality is actually likable unlike most of MCs in other shows I'd watched before. Plot/Story: 8/10 The story was kinda repetitive at some point. Also, the filler arcs made a lot of people lose interest in the show, but I liked most of them. I liked that other supporting characters got to shine during those arcs. Animation/Art: 9/10 I liked the animation since the first episode, and what I liked more, is that it kept getting better until the end of the show. The last seasons were the best. Music/Sound: OBVIOUSLY 10/10 You can say anything about Bleach, but when it comes to its OSTs, I believe that everyone agrees that Bleach's OST is simply iconic. Especially during the Hueco Mundo arc, the Spanish music was superior. 👌🏻 Enjoyment: 10/10 For me, Bleach is a MASTERPIECE 💙",9,Recommended,"Jul 31, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_727051686c,7

"Every time I hear the word Bleach—even laundry bleach to be honest—I always get struck by the nostalgia given to me by this anime. After all, I used to watch this anime a whole lot when it was shown in Philippines' channel GMA in the mornings. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that I'm reviewing this anime until around the Rurichiyo arc, so if you do not know who Rurichiyo is, please take care of possible spoilers! Being one of the shounen I have consumed since I was a kid, Bleach has some of the best storylines as far as I can remember. I recall trying to find bamboo sticks when I was younger, adorning them with a pink cloth from a ripped-out curtain, and shouting ""ZANPAKUTO"" and ""BANKAI"" when I'm playing by myself. That's how the storylines of Bleach influenced me. Perhaps the most memorable arc I have watched ""so far"" would be the Aizen arc, around episodes 150 to 170. Such spectacular execution that I would want to rewatch it sometime soon. The art, especially when the aspect ratio became 16:9, the improvement was certainly amazing as well, not to mention that many of the characters I liked based on their art—it evolved even more! The improvement per episode is nothing to scoff at, and judging by the fact that even more Bleach episodes will be released in the future, there is still many things to behold! As for the music, I would just want to praise one thing: the third opening entitled ""Ichirin no Hana."" I implore you to listen to it and hope that you'll get hooked just like how I did. The characters, especially the shinigami, were also memorable that even after years, I still remember their faces clearly. My two favorite characters would be Shuusuke Amagai—that one captain who gets drunk after one sip, and Rurichiyo Kasumiouji—that head of her clan. Overall, I am good memories of this anime that I still cherish to this day.

"2016 has to be one of the worst starts to the year; Terry Wogan, Lemmy, David Bowie and even Alan Rickman have bit the dust. But where are they now? If you have watched Tite Kubo's excellent anime Bleach, based on the manga of the same name, they will be somewhere in the Rukon district of Soul Society, all doing there thing, whilst many unknown things to them happen in the Seratai district. In the Seratai district, beings known as Shinagami (or Soul Reapers if you watch the English version of the show.) go down to earth and harvest dead souls to bring up to the Soul Society, and send evil souls to hell. This is to protect the 'balance of the universe', and what happens if a soul has been staying on Earth too long? They turn into demented creatures called Hollows, who must be killed to protect the universe. The very first episode sees one of these Soul Reapers (yes, I used the English term. Kill me now!) known as Rukia Kuchiki goes down to earth to defeat some hollows, but ends up destroying the house of Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see the usually invisible Soul Reapers. Rukia is wounded, and desperately gives all of her power to Ichigo. He saves Rukia but she committed a crime against the Soul Society, and is taken back by her brother Byakuya to be executed, setting up the first major arc. In terms of characters, Bleach has a whole host of great characters. My personal favourite is Kon; take Seth McFarlane's Ted and put in the mind and soul of Master Roshi and you pretty much have Kon...a perverted bear obssessed with boobies. Speaking of boobies, another cool character is Rangiku Matsumoto, a women obssessed with her looks. But seriously, there are so many great characters, so go and make your mind up yourself! What makes this anime so special for me though, is the Zanpaktou. A sword that can change into a weapon of unyielding power just by saying it's name. Rukia Kuchiki has a Zanpaktou called Sode No Shiryuiki, and Byakuya has one called Senbonzakura which can split into a billion blades. These alone give the anime a unique, awesome twist on a Shonen anime. Bleach has ended since 2012, but the manga is now in it's final arc. Please...PLEASE come back for that final arc! Pros: -A unique, compelling, funny and somewhat dark Shonen anime that is not afraid to show a bit of blood and gore here and there. -Memorable characters who will make you laugh and cry. -Very few plotholes are left in the anime, due to most of them being covered by the fillers (the fillers are not all that good though...see the cons) -A great soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu, also known for the soundtrack of Neo Genisis Evangelion -ZANPAKTOU MAN!!! Cons: -CAN'T STOP THIS FILLERRRRR! FILLER ALL NIGHT! Seriously, the fillers don't end... -The characters Jinta and Ururu are abandoned completely...it seemed like they were important...especially during the Arrancar arc, but now are just useless. -Art style is very basic. It brings nothing new to the table, other then perhaps cool monsters/demons Certification: Based on the story, art, sound, character and overall enjoyment, I give Bleach a Certified ++ rating for only the best anime. I really enjoyed this anime, and I am forever hoping it returns to our TV at some point or another. Reccomendations: Akame Ga Kill! - if your after the very style of action Bleach brings, this dark tale involving Assassins and a corrupt government is for you!

I like the many different plots and stories in each ark, but sometimes i with they would just stick to one plot and finish it. The art and sound were all great.

"In my opinion, Bleach (The first season) is arguably the best anime series in history. The story is gripping, the characters are so likeable it's unbelievable, and the fight scenes are as smooth and as epic as they come. The first season is the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, who is a young teen that has the ability to communicate with ghosts. After one such occurance, when a ghost was being attacked by a monster, Ichigo runs into Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper from the spirit &quot;realm&quot; of Sereitai, or Soul Society.

Rukia is sentanced to death, Ichigo doesn't like it, and so he goes to save Rukia from her fate.

I came to realize that this was an Anime that I wouldn't want to stop, just because the story seemed never ending: infinite. However, alas, it ended so I would like to write up an actual review for it. Now I don't usually write reviews but since this is one of my all time favorite Anime, I thought I should. I'll start with the story. If you read the manga, then you should already know that there are some fillers arcs in Bleach, but for those who only watched the Anime, the story is pretty consistent and keeps the viewers actively entertained. It starts with Kurosaki Ichigo gains powers to protect his friends and family, and it begins to become so much more than just that. He comes to realize that some of his friends also have abilities and they tackle several problems to save humanity and protect the ones they love. I give the story an 8 because at some points, the story goes back into the past IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FINAL BOSS BATTLE (as a filler to allow the manga to catch up), and also because some filler arcs/episodes were really boring. The Art is something I can't really rate because I'm not too picky about it. So I'm going to give it a 10 just because I didn't dislike, but was rather pleased with the way the characters/environment/attack skills/etc were drawn and animated. Bleach has some pretty interesting background music. Of course, I'm not a hardcore fan so I don't take much interest in knowing all about the OSTs but the music was very well laid out in the anime. 10/10 for it! The characters were simply amazing. I really liked how they kept on evolving, and just as you think they couldn't evolve any further, something new popped up. One of the reasons why I hate the fact that this Anime is over is the characters! 10/10 for characters. This Anime was one I enjoyed the most of all the others. I must say that this doesn't beat Code Geass in my opinion, but it was definately one I saw EVERY WEEK, especially when fillers weren't going on. And one of the filler arc was VERY entertaining. Therefore, a 9/10. Overall, this was one of the best Anime I have ever seen. As much I'd like to give it an 8, because they ended it, I feel compelled to give it at least a 9.",9,Recommended,"Mar 25, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e65545f3f2,7
"Word of forewarning with this Review: I am not rating Bleach for the fillers. I am strictly ignoring the fillers completely. I'll start in Chronological order as per rating listing here on the Review sheet. Also - A review is not based on how much you like the series, but it's based and grades on how well the series does at what it's genre is supposed to do. Not what YOU want it to do, or how YOU want it to develop. If you do not like the genre you SHOULD not rate it, because you will not be able to judge it for what it's worth, and that would be a SHOUEN Anime. Story: Shouen Anime. Before you judge a genre by its cover, you must first understand the target audience. Does the series deliver? Does the series stick to the manga? Does the story leave holes? Does the story disappoint? The series definitely delivers. There are plenty of enjoyable moments, it keeps you interested if you enjoy the genre, and it does everything the Genre does. If the series focused on love, romance and drama it would not deliver what it should as the genre it is. There are holes in the series. However right now they are existent because the anime has not reached the point in the manga the explains the holes ~ Thus there is nothing wrong here. Art: When grading art you must evaluate the quality of the artwork, how it emphases the scene, and how well it delivers the maximum potential of the series. Basically, you would not want Shoujo styled animation for a psychological series. When the series started it was in 4:3 ratio. Now it is in widescreen. The art was fine, the style of animation was generic and it delivered its point. It succeeds in providing the maximum impact of epicness when important scenes come up with heavy movement and animation. Once again - I am not grading filler arc animation as everyone knows the budget is cut during fillers thus mildly rushed animation is used. The art remains stable throughout the series, and it delivers enjoyable graphic entertainment. Does it push the bar above other series and use new rendering techniques and styles? No, it does not get a 10, but rather a 9. Sound: When rating the sound, you need to check for stock used loops, stocks and tracks. The soundtrack for bleach is great. Comical tracks, Emphatically Styled tracks, Battle theme music, and uniquely designed custom sounds for actions during the series. Does the sound and audio push harmony to its limits while blending with the art, scene, and seriousness of the series? Yes, but not all the time. It doesn't deserve a 10, yet does not deserve an 8 because it gets it's point across and remains completely enjoyable. The music is also nice, thus it gets a 9. Character: Once again, SHOUEN Anime. You are not to rate/grade the characters for their traits or uniqueness outside of the bounds of the genre they belong in. If the characters acted immature and comical in a horror series, it would not fit. However each of the characters in bleach remain unique in their own way, while allowing you to become attached to the character over time if not right away by how they act and react to situations. Bleach's characters are all completely different. From the War/Fighting crazy Kenpachi, to the cute and innocent Orihime, to the loud and boisterous bastard Grimmjow, to the typical character you might want to stab for acting like such a douche Uliqorra. Each character has their own traits, and does not appear generic. The most important Character, Ichigo, his character is perfect for the Hero of a SHOUEN series. Thus the characters get a 10. Enjoyment: Enjoyment grading should remain as unbiased as possible however this is clearly impossible since people have different taste which boil down to how much they enjoy something regardless of the quality of whatever they watch. Does the SHOUEN anime satisfy the genre by providing life lessons while showing scenes that enthrall the watcher into wanting to see the next 20 seconds in a mere instant because of interest? Yes. Does a series have to do this constantly? No, if it did the series would become chaotic and would be too dramatic and motionful to pay attention to, let alone understand what is going on. 10 for Enjoyment. Overall: 10, 9, 9, 10, 10 It gets a 10.",10,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3c7b261e6d,7
"As one of the 'big three' I felt I had to watch it eventually, I've watched Naruto, and I've decided I can never watch One Piece for a few reasons. So, Bleach was on the hitlist. Story 9/10 - Some of the arcs in this series were truly epic, yeah the filler arcs were unwanted, but that's how it is with big anime. So I try to focus on the canon arcs and as I said, they are epic. The way it finished at ep366 was bittersweet, but I'm glad to hear the show is coming back! Art 8/10 - The characters and their swords/powers are all unique enough to make them distinguishable, which is always a good thing. The world is a little dull, but I've seen worse. I will admit though, as the years went by, the art style became 10 times better. Sound 10/10 - Easily the stand out part of the anime, the intros are mostly awesome, but where it shines is the battle music, the great orchestral instruments make the fights seem so emotional and brilliant. Yes, definitely the greatest in-show music I’ve witnessed in anime. Character 8/10 - Many of the character, whether protagonists or antagonists are full of style and emotion, they are fun. The only downside is that they are all arrogant and believe far too much in their own power no matter what. There is decent character development throughout. Enjoyment 9/10 - There's plenty of action, comedy, suspense, everything you need really in an anime. If anything it's a little too fast paced. Overall 9/10 - A great anime that has undoubtedly inspired newer anime (such as demon slayer.) Not many anime can go on for so long and keep the viewers interested. Bleach holds a special place with it's viewers where, it isn't anyone's favourite anime, but not many people dislike it.",9,Recommended,"May 22, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_156046ed01,7
"There are not many series as popular as Bleach, but this truly deserves a recommendation. The story about the Main character, who becomes a Soul Reaper, has really been worked out well. When you go further in the series, after about 25 episodes, you are already feeling with the main character Ichigo. As you go further in the series, the more battles you'll get, and the more of the fun will start. The good part is that it's not always serious and that there are many times when humor is brought forward. Ofcourse it ain't always perfect, and therefore i'd say the only not fitting part of the story are the fillers in the serie. Tite Kubo has made a great effort in all the artwork. He created an environment in which the story perfectly fit, and the characters are drawn very nice. The 3 world are so well worked out, that you know exactly when they are in the real world, the world of the hollows or the world of the soul reapers. I think the best part of the serie is the music. The mood is all set by the music, and they fit that so perfectly well, that I'd say it's even worth watching just for the music. My personal opinion about the serie is that you should just watch, and if you still don't like it after more than 30 episodes, you shouldn't continue, but just give it a try. If you do, I'll promise it will be better, even though you may not always like the fillers.",9,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b168ee6d48,7
"This series is undoubtly the first ever anime series that ive watched. It sparked my interest and before long, taking me deeper into the world of Japanese Animation. Now, it is one of the best, to me, of all the current ongoing anime series that i am following. The story just keeps escalating and i am itching to read the manga. Awesome characters with unique individual powers and outrageously powerfull enemies. Every battle the protagonist goes into, Kurosaki Ichigo, seems like one where he will never win. Of course, good always triumph over evil, so he and his comrades manages from time to time. Sadly, the inevitable series killer ie, fillers, have also began to infect this once filler-free series.(lol) To me, it survived this phase as the story quality of the first fillers are, surprisingly to say, entertaining. Unlike some series that im sure millions of you out there know of. Although, the second phase of fillers didnt quite meet my expectations.

"My review has a few spoilers from earlier seasons (maybe up to season 4), so beware... The first season of Bleach was great. It had school life, it had an interesting supernatural story going on, humour, short battles with good animation, and music unlike anything I've heard in other anime - stuff that sends chills down your spine and really fits the series. Really, it was just amazing. The opening theme was also just above standards. Words can't describe how unique and enjoyable it was, plus it was a good song. That red/white/blue theme they had Ichigo dressed in... Really, just an outstanding fashion statement. People today wear dark colours that kinda blend together, but that stuff really stood out just like Ichigo's orange hair and HUGE sword. All that AND this was a sweet samurai-type show? Awesome! Most of the other opening themes are also pretty cool, but not in the same way the first opening was. When a menos showed up, that was some creepy stuff, had my hairs standing up. Everything was just perfect and the series looked promising. Anyhow, that stuff was off the hook. Then Rukia got taken away and things started going downhill from there... We lost the school life and supernatural parts of the show forever, and those were some of my favourite parts. Season 2 introduced many interesting characters to us and had some cool stuff, but it was kinda getting dull and straying from a story to just senseless fighting. By the time it was over, the show was still alright, but nowhere near as kickass as the first season. ... And things continued to go downhill. Worse than that, we got fillers. Fillers that were exact copies of YuYu Hakusho. Seriously, that thing where Ichigo and friends went up against Nova (he looked cool) and those other two doll things... It was exactly like when Yusuke and friends went up against those other supernatural kids in town. In the end, it was Urahara's idea of training them, just like in YuYu Hakusho how it was Genkai's plan. The show became dull... it became a copy of Dragonball Z. It's just pointless, dragged on fighting in wastelands and deserts. The enemy will have a clear advantage, the Ichigo will have a huge opening, what will the enemy do? Kick Ichigo into a nearby mountain, crumbling it and leaving Ichigo to push a boulder off of his body and have some blood running down his forehead over his eye. In season 2 when Ichigo fought Madarame, they actually made a fuss about that blood, and I thought that was kinda cool, but now it's just the same ol' DBZ shit. This show has become a total joke. The swords they use are merely for show. They never cut each other; only kick each other. You can't even cut someone like Kenpachi just because he has a strong will; it's ridiculous. Why do they use swords at all? They occasionally stab through or slice each other a little, fine... they could probably do that without the swords, though. It's not even the sword so much that does anything; it's the characters themselves. Speaking of which, what's with Ichigo's bankai? He gets a swastika guard on his sword and it turns small and black... Yeah, great. It looks kinda cool, but it doesn't do anything. Anyhow, it's just boring. It's a series that heavily relies on the battle scenes, but even those are dull since the swords are useless. There are rare occasions when the show is funny or interesting, but it's really not worth it. There are loads of amazing anime series that are only 13 or 24 episodes. Those series can actually make you feel some emotion and make you really laugh, but Bleach is just lame. The Bleach movies also suck and use the same storyline that the fillers use (a long lost shinagami wants revenge!). The show should've stayed like how it was in season 1.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 29, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45c0697c5f,7
"Fan Rating: 9/10 Critic Rating: 5/10 Unfortunately, I have to consider Bleach dropped. Once the whole Aizen mess wrapped up, I completely lost interest. I am happy the ending of that whole storyline could easily have served as a series ending. I am content to say Ichigo and his friends lived happily ever after and ignore the fact the series just keeps going and going and going. I did some research on the manga's later arcs, and I did find myself intrigued by the back story concerning Ichigo's parents. Although, it also struck me as being a little too soapy. I don't know. I may have to give the manga a shot. Anyway, from a fan perspective, this series is a delight. Unfortunately, after the Bount Saga, the overall quality of the main arcs weaken. However, there are still iconic moments. It's just too difficult to weigh the pros and cons. For all of the tedious filler, it often felt worth it just to get to Ulquiorra vs. Ichigo, or the revelation of Gin, or many other amazingly heart wrenching moments. Still, after the first two arcs, the parts seem greater than the whole. Stunning sequences, but overall weak story structures. The filler arcs were mostly not that bad. The Bounts I thought was amazing, and I did not know at first it was filler because it fit in with the continuity. The themes of oppression, of denying a minority group, led to complex characters who at times really did make me tear up. Anime excels at making the political personal. Yoshino and ideas of motherhood, cult personality vs. individuality, and martyrdom opened my heart and mind. However, the series is so long, I'm not sure if I will be rewatching anytime soon to expound on those ideas. And still, there are some gender issues. The main female characters, Orihime and Rukia, are way too sacrificial and weak. Rukia is more interesting as a character study. But I just couldn't with Orihime. At first, I was interested in how she wanted to be stronger, then in how to make her healing powers, a passive power, work in a culture that values active aggression. However, her sacrificing moment was annoying. I know she's not meant to be an Einstein, but the fact that one stupid decision lead to such a huge story arc with so freakin' many episodes, one my absolute favorite, is bittersweet. And yet still, her confrontation with jealously shows how strong her heart is (even if often to the setback of her friends). The filler arcs are usually too slow in the beginning and wonderfully epic in their ending. The Captain Amagai arc was the worst upfront. The Muramasa arc became redundant in the middle as the same characters used the same powers over and over and the epilogue arc with the Sword Beasts brought the overall quality down further. Still, the proper ending was philosophical and beautiful. Again, Bleach's highs and lows are in constant dual with me. There were too many arrancars. I am happy the filler arcs were there, but they were all too long. If this whole series were edited down, it would have been a masterpiece. Instead, it's a personal favorite that is good with often extended moments of poignant beauty. Some more thoughts: The overall world building has some shaky ideas. The citizens of the Soul Society act like they are a completely different race from humans; yet they really are just humans that have died. Their estrangement with the living does not often make sense. Also, the series was difficult to adjust to at first. In the beginning, the stories are episodic. Each episode has Ichigo battling a hollow, and the story lines build, getting bigger. Once they enter the social society, I could not believe how decompressed the storytelling became. Battles took on many episodes. Once I skipped ahead to see how long before the Soul Society Arc ended. When I got the gist, I settled into it and enjoyed. Like the iconic, and often templated, DBZ, Bleach works on a power up model. For some this might be tedious. However, it did not bother me, mainly because of the drama and conflict provided by Ichigo's dark side. Like many in this genre, the sheer charisma of the characters and the epic spectacles which each have their own (often more interesting) stories kept me from probing the holes too deeply. Unfortunately, the inability to close read the world building without it falling apart leads to a low critic score.",7,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f91b9085eb,7

"This is an anime series with more than 300+ episodes and the name of the anime is totally unimportant and irrelevant to the story. Story : This anime has no plot by any means, simply an unending stream of battles with no point, hung together with adversaries getting a adjustment in appearance in every new battle. The battles are as faltering as they can get : An arbitrary character will be running and another person will show up in their path for reasons unknown. At that point it will cut into a flashback demonstrating that they were companions like 10 years back. At that point they will talk for 20 minutes and afterward begin battling. They'll battle for like...7 scenes? At that point they will claim to have been holding back and going easy and then the two character will start shouting and yelling at each other. The fundamental character, Ichigo Kurosaki transforms into a reptile. Wtf? The art is great. Sound is decent. 1/10 Overall.

The characters had potential and ichigo is prolly the best protagonist from the big three. The best part of this show is prolly the world building which is actually pretty good imo.

"Bleach... has everything you're looking for in an anime/manga. Story: Outstanding. Like many anime series, it does start off a bit slow, but as usual, this is needed to develop the story into something greater. Remember if an anime doesn't have a strong and developed foundation, then it's not going to be able to develop a deep and long lasting story that actually makes sense. YES, there are mini-filler series after each story-arc, but this was needed to keep it from catching the manga. Also, many people advice skipping the filler episodes, but I would highly advise against it. My reasoning for this, is character depth, and a change of pace that gives you something lighter to enjoy for a short time before getting back into another deep and serious story arc. I think you may get slightly burned out on constant life & death struggles if you skip them. Also, some of them were actually really great, and most were very funny. I felt there was a little too much silliness from time to time, but remember this series is meant to attract 13 year olds as well. Also... while yes action and storyline is the ""main attraction"" (theme song you'll hear a lot in main battles), there IS actually an interesting love triangle thing going on, just hints here and there, but enough to make Shoujo anime fans appreciate it and enjoy. (I mention this as some have said there is no romance, including the writer, which isn't the case). Character: This is the TRUE strong point for me in Bleach, I REALLY love these characters... not just the main character, or the 3 characters you see the most, but most all of the characters, as they are so different and interesting... I'm a hardcore Light side/good guy fan, but I even found myself finding redeeming qualities in the bad guys... they kind of show how they became that way, and you feel kind of sorry for them, and the ones who have to die... or possibly not die... as is the case with Grimmjow (you'll see, no spoiler). Yes Ichigo is awesome, but I have to say, Kenpachi Zaraki is just so cool... And MY personal favorite, is and always will be Sui-Feng (soifon)!!! I claim her, she's mine. Animation: Early in season 1, the animation is around a 6 or 7, kind of meh... but it doesn't take long before it steps up it's game and becomes an 8 or 9, and quite beautiful. So just bear with it for the first few episodes before animation alone pushes you away. Voice acting & Music: One of the best I've experienced. Voice acting for both dubbed and original is fantastic, I personally couldn't ask anymore from it. Music soundtrack is spectacular, the intro and credits song changes every season, and it ALWAYS grows on you, fight music is great, slow music is great... you'll appreciate it. I've watched my fair share of good anime as is evident from my list, and I'm pretty fair with my scoring, and I have so many that I really loved, and I know a lot of people just insta-troll and call fanboy, but in all seriousness, it's really great, and I feel that if you didn't at least watch one full season before quitting it, then you really missed out and I don't feel you can accurately judge the series otherwise, making your point rather invalid... My final point is... Anime series DO NOT last this long unless they are pretty good overall, I've seen too many series that only go 13 episodes, or 1 or 2 seasons when they are soooo amazing and deserve more time... THIS is one that got more time, and really made it a good ride. The anime recently ended... for no reason, since it's killing the market, and the manga is still going and just reached what is adding up to be the best story arc yet... I can't believe that something so epic won't reach animation, so I expect the series to be picked back up soon.",10,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4c9f6c4ea3,8
"Bleach First of all Bleach is a good anime with a lot of action and comedy, but the filler sucks. Story: Bleach is about Kurosaki Ichigo, he’s 16-years old. Ichigo can see spirits, so he is special.

Then a monster appear and the Shinigami is struggling against it, then she and Ichigo agrees to stab Ichigo in his stomach….

The art is nothing special, it’s like Naruto, Bleach etc.. . Sound: Good openings and endings. The voice characters does a good job. Hitsugaya Toushiro has an awesome voice!! All the voices are awesome. Characters: The characters have a unique personality, and you will like them. Like all the other shounen series there is always two characters who are arguing each others and fight.

"Firstly, I started watching anime in about 2003, with Sailor Moon. After that, I branched off to other animes. However, when I discovered my best friend obsessed with Bleach, I decided I would never read or watch it, since I believed it was just another of those mainstream animes which would let me down. Besides, I always thought the hero would go around taking himself way to seriously. So, I avoided it like the plague, until 2009, when a new friend finally convinced me to watch it. What was so brilliant about this anime, that attracts every animefreak around, and makes up 76% of anime conventions? So, I went home and watched episode 1. In three days straight, I'd watched 64 episodes, non-stop. I was right; Kurosaki DOES take himself way to seriously. Why am I telling you this lifestory? Sorry to bore you, but I'm writing this review to tell you why you should watch and read Bleach, right? I've not watched many animes, I admit, compared to quite a few people here. However, ever had that feeling when you see the first episode of an anime or drama and think, 'Wow, I want to see what happens next!' or 'This is sooo awesome!'? Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Bleach. When a Hollow (spirit eating monsters), attacks 15 year old Kurosaki Ichigo's family one night, his life changes forever. Turned into a shinigami (Death God) and granted the power to rid his town of these evil beings, Kurosaki goes out to save to world. Cliché much? No kidding. The underlying plotline: save the world IS...cliché and, to a limit, exasperating. But think about it: Story [8] - otherworld shinigami, a whole new life after this one, Some kind of academy with a million soldiers wandering around in traditional japanese hakamas and katana.

"Synopsis: Ichigo Kurosaki seems to be a regular highschool student, except for the fact that he has been able to see and talk to ghosts since he was a kid. One day, his house is attacked by a malevolent spirit, known as a hollow. He’s saved by Rukia Kuchiki a shinigami sent to kill the hollow and protect the living. Rukia fails to defeat the Hollow, and instead places her hopes on Ichigo, to whom she transfers her powers. After defeating the beast, Ichigo is saddled with the responsibility of protecting his town from evil spirits with Rukia as his mentor. Pros: Amazing fight scenes with cool powers and villains. The characters are amazingly well done in terms of character design. There is a variety of powers and abilities. And all around just a badass show. Cons: 1/3 of the 366 episodes are fillers albeit not all were bad. The fact that the anime got cancelled and never decided to animate that last arc of the story.(If you want to check out the manga after the you finish the anime read chapter from 479) Bleach has in my opinion the 2nd highest amount of plot armor in anime, losing 1st to Fairy Tail. There are 3 worlds and yet there is hardly any world building. Ichigo actually only has one move :/ (Getsugaaaaaa Tenshooooo) Weird pacing issues, mainly due to the fact that Shounen Jump was rushing Tite Kubo to finish. And oh God that fucking ending!!!!(Referring to the manga) So I'd still recommend Bleach to anyone who is trying to get into anime or to someone who likes action/shounen battle anime. Bleach does have 336 epsiodes so it is a bit time consuming. But if you skip all the filler it's only 200 episodes. http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a7a35463b0,8
"The first arc is very good. The Arrancar arc is what kind of ruined it for me. They introduced some of the most annoying characters I ever seen in anime (Nel, Dondachaka and that other idiot that followed the main cast around) Some of the fight scenes were dragged out way to long for fodder uninteresting Arrancar. The only interesting Arrancar introduced were Grimmjow and Ulquiorra. Oh and one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE IS WHEN THEY TELL EACH OTHER ALL OF THEIR ABILITIES IN DETAIL FOR LIKE HALF THE F**** EPISODE. Some of the fights seem dragged out for no reason. I absolutely hate orihime she is such a horrible character, why would you rehash a rescue arc all over again??? I can’t believe she snuck in ichigo’s room while he was sleeping and tried to sexually assault him in sleep lol. Oh yeah Ichigo..... this dude has so much plot armor it’s ridiculous. Yeah he gets his a** beat a lot but then he pulls something out his a** to win. He also gets stronger out of the blue sometimes and it makes no sense. I really wanted to finish this series because I like most of the soul reaper captains / lieutenants. I wanted to see Aizen fight, but I just can’t continue this show anymore. Soi Fons fat a** lieutenant is so annoying I just skip every scene he is in.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 20, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5307fd79e6,8
"Okay sooo Bleach was one of my all time favorite mainstream animes and i am HIGHLY disappointed that they ended the anime b4 the Manga was completed. Never the less, this anime brought out some amazing characters with outstanding abilities, (namely Byakuya with his Senbonzakura). Half of the fillers were fairly decent, which is quite rare, and somewhat entertaining. I say if you have the time and wanna see a new spin on sword play, watch Bleach. But then read the manga cause they ended the anime too soon and they're DUMB!!!",9,Recommended,"Apr 7, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7ebd3c38bb,8

"Bleach is an interesting and exciting anime thats loses youserlf in the middle of a lot of fillers, lazy or lack of character development, very convenient use or lack of powers and rules that can be easily broken if the character is just stronger. Story: 6/10 It starts really good, but uses repetitive justifications as an answer for every challange, some characters at the end say that Ichigo never change and its literally true, he NEVER changes despite getting more and more powers and all of it just seens so easily given that its so frustating sometimes. Tite Kubo couldn't get tired of the formula fight + almost die fighting + get new boss power = show up with a badass face like a imortal shinigami that crushes the enemy. There's those powers that show up saving the day without never being mentioned before, enemys that often get weaker when they should get stronger, because they JUST got a new power or transformation, but no, not enough to defeat Ichigo. Also, there's those enemys with abysmal powers that forget a little of it after some episodes, like THIS ONE that's absolutely so broken and stop being used by THAT GUY after he gets his ""god transformation"" and everyone stops worring about it when they were worried about it for almost 300 episodes. However, fights are great even if you take all of this in consideration, at least most of them, some are just boring fights from characters that nobody cares. Bleach also has a lot of fillers arcs that show up in the middle of the main stuff, so watching this every week should have been hell, gladly its mostly arcs and not one filler + one canon + one filler + one canon like other anime did, THAT was definitively torture. Art: 7/10 While some characters designs are awful, most of them are unique and brings a lot of charisma to the anime. Animation is at least good 99% of the time, without memorable deformations. Sound: 9/10 Openings are good in general, soundtrack is a highlight that Studio Pierrot seens to love. Bleach's soundtrack seens to focus on the greatness of fights. which fits very well, because empowered fights is the best that Bleach has to offer. Character: 6/10 The development of characters is basic for most of them, what's frustating is that supposedly big characters end up having very poor explanations on some cases, so the animes lacks pay off for watching so many episodes hoping to get just a spark of development that justifies why they do what they do. Some characters that have excellent designs are so shallow and the development that matters stays with the main protagonist for the first arc, then there are just sparks between a lot of good fights. There's no deep in emotions and not much time to know characters, because the anime is fast paced despite having 366 episodes and what is given isn't convincing enough. Enjoyment: 6/10 Bleach in fun to watch, but don't go waiting for strong connection with characters. The anime doesn't seen to care about wasting time getting at the heart of the viewer and there's not much effort here besides trying to deliver amazing fights at the end. Most of the characters that show up a lot or a little are barely emotionally developed for more than a few episodes or a few minutes, they are cool because of design or attitude and that's it, but there's a lot of uninteresting ones and it's hard to even care about the fight if you think both characters fighting are boring.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 5, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e7591ff26b,8
"I really enjoyed Aizen as an antagonist, also the animation for the whole Arrancar arc. One thing that i didn't like about bleach is that there was too many fillers for me but i got used to it and skipped a lot of them and everything but that fact Bleach is really good. The characters are so well done, Especially Aizen and Shinji they were so good i loved all of the episodes with them in it. Another + in Bleach is the openings, I love op 13, 2, 1, 12, etc. Another thing i kinda disliked about Bleach was the sudden power ups for the MC but i dont entirely hate the fact because it makes the fights 20X better.",9,Recommended,"Jan 10, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_91e4f3fc98,8

He will never give up on somthing once hes set his mind to it, and the most imortant things to him are his friends and family. There are many solid characters, but with every great anime there has to be some set backs. Rukia is not my favorite character because she just gets in the way, also there are many filler arcs not found in the manga so things may get confusing. lots of action, some drama, lots of comedy, and blood.

NOT SPOILER Bleach is not possible to compare with Naruto and One Piece as many others do. It's the same as if you would have compared LordOfTheRings with Harry Potter. Bleach has a special story that develops more and more. It is easy to love the characters and there is always something going on but sometimes it becomes too much of something that is not full so exciting which can do that it gets a little boring so therefore I can not give 10/10.

"I wanted to avoid this for some time since this anime is/was very popular and there are many different opinions about it, but....here goes. Story: 7/10 When I first saw Bleach, I thought the story was very interesting, with the Shinigamis and Hollows and all that. It promised to be a nice story. However, the story started slow (really slow). It went something along the lines of ""Hey you are a Soul Reaper, here's a Hollow, go and reap it"" until episode 20 or so. Then it started to become more interesting with the Soul Society Arc. After that, boy oh boy. The story takes a nose dive. It becomes a mindless shounen with the premise that the main character is the only one who can save the Soul Society blah blah blah (where have I heard this before.) Not to mention this anime has fillers galore. Art: 7/10 Nothing special. The animations are good at best and the bland backgrounds don't help either. Sound: 8/10 Nothing extraordinary, but nothing bad either. The soundtracks fit the fight well and add to it in it's own sense. Some of the OST, especially in the beginning, are bad, but after that they get pretty good. Also never understood the composer's fixation with spanish-inspired music Character: 5/10 Easily the worst flaw in Bleach. Starting from the main character, his personality is next to nonexistent. Just random ""I will save everyone"" speeches and going to save people that are in danger solely for him to go save them. Ichigo doesn't develop as a character during 350+ episodes and remains the same ""energetic guy"" who wants to save his friends even though, throughout the series he barely even talks with them. The supporting cast is severely lacking in character development also. Be it Ishida, Chad, Rukia or Orihime (oh god, not her), no one develops as a character and remains the same one since when they were first introduced. Character design is lacking in imagination. All Shinigami have the black robe (Captains have a white vest over it), which makes it feel like the author isn't even trying to make interesting and unique character designs. Also the bad guys (Espadas) are all white. Enjoyment: 8/10 Despite it's major flaws, Bleach managed to entertain me for quite a while. Maybe because I have a soft spot for sword fighting in general. The series also had some humorous parts during the first seasons, which I liked, but then, as the series progressed, it became more and more difficult for me to like it because of the above-mentioned flaws. To summarize: (+) Interesting story (+) Cool fights (-) Mediocre character development (-) ""I must save every one"" cliche (-) Bad pacing of story and fights. (-) Fillers galore. You actually need a list to know what to watch and what to skip.",7,Recommended,"Sep 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_73e4e2d980,8
"Well, i won't bore you with the whole plot details, so here we go: Story - 8.7/10 (B+) The show really does take off from episode 1, and the way in which Ichigo meets Rukia is just really well done, not amazing, but better than i expected. It's a little sluggish at the beginning, but not to worry, only some dry humor to worry about. The way the story is told makes you feel like you're a part of this whole drama. Animation - 8.3/10 (B) Bleach has fairly good animation, especially the Bankai of all the Captains, including Ichigo's. It doesn't blow me away, but it doesn't disappoint, either. Sound - 7.9/10 (C+) Bleach can really nail it when it comes to comedic scenes, but when it comes to boss fights (Ex. Byakuya vs Ichigo), it kinda sucked. I heard the song that was playing and nearly choked on how bad it sounded and how it couldn't even fit. Now, not all of it is bad, but when you have memorable/important fights, you kinda want to remember the song played too. Characters - 9.5/10 (A) Holy crud, Bleach has a ton of characters. But they do a good job with giving each character a fair amount of airtime, given that Bleach is a long-running show. A short summary of the characters are: The Gotei 13, Karakura Town Residents (Ex. Urahara), Soul Society, Hueco Mundo (Ex. Espada's, Menos). But so far, they've all had their time to shine. Enjoyment - 10/10 (A+) I'm currently on Episode 200, i have watched every single episode and i might sound like a Narutard but: I love this show! I can never stop watching this!, It's the longest show i've watched, the most entertaining and enjoyable show so far. None of these new shows won't suffice. Bleach has always been compared to Naruto, but (as a Bleach fan) Naruto is LEAGUES away from Bleach. It can never obtain the well-told plot, it's remarkable and hated characters, it's concept of blending Japanese with Spanish (Hueco Mundo, Espadas) cultures and the overall better fights that Bleach can make. The fillers are more bearable than Naruto's, believe it. (pun intended) Overall Averaged: 8.8/10 (B+) The Good: A great introduction to the series, the massively large cast that actually has a purpose (unlike Naruto) of being there. The emotions of the characters gets to you fast. The Bad: Choice of music during great fights. For example the incredibly long Byakuya vs Ichigo fight: the music really made me gag, no seriously. Had a slight case of &quot;Naruto Filler Syndrome&quot;, only not as much filler.",8,Recommended,"Jan 5, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b595d72217,8
"I discovered bleach by watch the dubbed version on television and at first glance i was not that impressed. Dragon Ball Z being my first anime ever watched, my view of shounen anime and most anime in general had pretty much been destroyed. Soon after that i began to watch the show subbed and my view of Bleach changed significantly. Sadly I still think the episodes building up to the Soul Society arc still are not that impressive. The beginning of Bleach starts out pretty how all other mainstream shounen anime starts out. Guy with strange hair is able to see spirits and soon discovers that there are bad spirits (Hollow) who eat souls that have yet to pass on into a place called the Soul Society and there are Shinigami who kill hollow and save the soul who have not passed yet. Main character Ichigo, who is: stubborn, quick to anger, protects his friends, not always the sharpest spoon in the drawer; obtains Shinigami powers and begins his fate of saving the world several times. I am very pleased to say however that the very crude synopses above does not give Bleach proper justice. From the Soul Society arc onward, despite the filler arcs, Bleach hosts a wide variety characters; all with their own unique backgrounds and positions in and out of the Soul Society. Bleach Plot doesn't simply translate into main character and friends go through the ladder of bad guys and get their ass handed to by main evil boss. Shortly followed by main protagonist pulling something out of his ass to save the day and then wait for an even stronger bad guy to appear. In each arc of the Bleach series there is unique goal that Ichigo and friends try to accomplish. And the protagonist is not always the most powerful when said goal is accomplished, leaving room for growth and character development. Even when the main cast of characters obtain new powers they often gain a new perspective with that power. Overall the show delivers many plot twists and a complex history of both the soul society and the hollow world. Another aspect of Bleach that drew me in was the complexity of the enemy forces, they are not simply just hollow but various level of hollow and the birth of the Arrancar, etc. It is true that Bleach in recent time has started to drag on and maybe it is time to just leave it after this arc is over. Despite what many will say Bleach is not just another long and annoying shounen anime. It is most certainly a step above the rest and a must watch. Hope this will be helpful to some you :D",9,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5b32c75da2,9
"As a long-time fan of shounen shows and mangas, I dare to say I was heavily depressed with bleach, for the fact the fights are way too boring and uncreative, and would make other shounen artists like Hirohiko Araki or Togashi Yoshihiro facepalm in dissapointment. it doesnt help either that the story backgrounds lack feelings or resolve, you wont feel inspiration or excitement in these fights. its no longer about comparing it to One piece or naruto which are the hot popular stuff now, bleach even pales to classic shounen tales like Rurouni kenshin, Jojo, Yuyu hakusho or Saint seya, or other underlooked mangas like kenichi, soul eater or full metal alchemist. there is just no feelings here, just pretentiousness and simplistic mindless fights coated with good artwork and &quot;attractive&quot; characters.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 17, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_30928c8168,9
"As with all long-running series, I think you have to judge Bleach differently than a tightly-woven short-story. Shows like Bleach and Naruto are simply constructed differently than Madoka or Steins;Gate. An anime that follows on ongoing manga plays a different role, it's meant to build a fan-base, and to continue to layer new stories on top of a concept for a long, long time. Yes, this is partly a shameless commercial exercise, but it also lets us have something reliable to read or watch every week. So let's give Bleach credit where it is due. This is a great shonen with some truly unforgettable moments. First off, the character designs are amazing. The clothing, in particular, is always impressive, and I think Kubo could have been a fashion designer if he had wanted to. The size of the cast is impressive, and even moreso when you consider how distinct each squad (and each squad's leaders) appear. Second, the show was able to take some very, very generic concepts and reforge them into something that felt unique and fresh. The show is more-or-less a patchwork of Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball Z, and (insert any high-school fighting anime here) - but it works! Third, the show did not let the main character hog all the screen time. You know your generic shonen hero is successful when the audience really wants him to kick someone's ass, and I felt this way on multiple occasions. However, I think one sign of a BAD shonen protagonist is that he has to stick his nose into every fight and plot-line. Bleach avoids this, with tons of quality fights between other characters, while still giving Ichigo the spotlight. Fourth, Ichigo may be overly-confident at times, but he's not a brainless dolt riding high on childishness. He's a bit more mature, and this is a good thing from my point of view. I prefer a cool character with the occasional sense of humor to an always-aloof prodigy. Fifth, many of the fights were magnificently choreographed. There are easily 20 fights in Bleach that you could re-watch dozens of times in your life, without ever getting bored of them. That said, there were problems, even given the nature of a long-running shonen: First off, the show indisputably peaked in the Soul Society arc. Considering how long ago this was, that's a genuine problem. This arc had everything, and it was one of the best arcs in a shonen ever, but nothing after this point ever came close. Second, Ichigo's friends were left in the dust when he made new allies. I think the most tragically under-developed character is Orihime. While everyone else gets incredibly strong compared to their early incarnations, Orihime is forever reduced to being a ""healer"" (although that's not the true nature of her power). Third, the fights in Bleach start to follow a set formula after a while. This is a major flaw. It becomes apparent that ""whoever uses their full power first loses,"" and ""you cannot die until your back-story episode has run."" Fourth, Kubo is undeniably lazy when it comes to background art. White backgrounds EVERYWHERE. It's as if they were... Bleached! In conclusion, Bleach is a great long-running shonen series that certainly deserved its spot as part of the ""big three."" Now that it is coming to an end once and for all, I am genuinely going to miss it. However, even I have to admit that it is probably the right time for Kubo to move on. The series has been slowly devolving into something that is rather boring, and I would rather remember the good moments. Perhaps Kubo will even come up with something even better in the future.",7,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_117dc685b4,9
"At the begining the theme and story were great; Shinigamis (Simular to Grim reapers. Though they look more like a fusion between a Samurai and Grim reaper), and the Zanpaktou was a great and original idea. At the begining i loved this anime, especially after episode 15 (or 16 when Ichigo first fights Renji) from there I was hooked on. Bleach continued to surprise me every episode, from the Soul Society arc right through to the build-up to Hueco Mundo. But that all stopped when they actually entered Hueco Mundo. From then on (in my opinion) the story started degrading as every episode started to be nothing but fighting. Ichigo has a fight, Renji has a fight blablabla, once they've beaten that person then another person comes along (straight away) and another fight starts. Its gotten so repetative that these days i actually look foward to Bleach fillers. The art and animation of Bleach is good (if Bleach is going to be fight after fight then they have to make sure they atleast have good animated fights). Bleaches characters i love. Every character has something unique to them and they don't steriotype (i.e some animes that make all the females useless people that stand around and rely on the men). Plus i love the fact that they don't base the anime around just the main character but instead most of the characters get quite abit of spotlight. Personally i don't like Ichigo but that doesn't matter because i get to see quite alot of my other favorite characters in Bleach. Other animes i would end up hating because i don't like the main character and everything is based on the main character. I don't get as much enjoyment out of Bleach as i used to but it still entertains me abit.

"Bleach is amazing! Are there a few problems with this anime? Yes, there are. But I believe the pros far outweigh the cons. Easily Bleach's biggest strength, at least in my opinion, are its characters. Never before in any show have I seen such a well put-together cast. The cast is very large--you have Ichigo, Rukia, and a few of Ichigo's close friends, who comprise of the main cast. But beyond them, you also have the 13 court guard squads, the visoreds, the arrancars...and many more. Many of these less-important side characters, even if they don't get quite as much screentime, still feel very well fleshed out and have unique and memorable designs and personalities. Shuhei and Sajin are my personal favorites. Although the plot gets a bit convoluted at times, I think it still tells a good story. The main villain, whose name is (SPOILER), and the members of his army are very intimidating and sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. There are several interesting plot twists throughout the story as well. And, despite what most people say about the Fullbringer arc, I personally really enjoyed it. The animation looks amazing, the plot is solid, and it felt like the perfect epilogue for Ichigo's story. Some fight scenes drag on for much too long (Renji and Uryu vs. Szayelaporro comes to mind) but overall the fights in Bleach are very action packed and enjoyable. The characters all have a variety of special abilities, ensuring that each fight will be a unique matchup. The music is good too! I love the opening themes, especially 12, 13, and 15. MY THOUGHTS ON BLEACH'S FILLER: Although a lot of people have a rather negative opinion on the filler episodes, I actually found (most) of them to be quite enjoyable. The first filler arc, the Bount arc, dragged on for too long and was mildly entertaining at best, but the other three filler arcs are pretty solid, as are many of the standalone episodes (287 and 304 are especially funny!) The only thing that is a bit irritating to me is the fact that the middle two filler arcs--the Shusuke Amagai and Zampakuto arcs--don't really fit into continuity that well. Both of these arcs aired in the middle of the manga arcs and therefore had to be set to take place at a different point in time. (as opposed to the first and fourth filler arcs, which aired AND took place in-between the manga arcs.) Unfortunately, there isn't a place in the story's timeline where either arc can fit in without at least some plot holes being created in the process, at least as far as I can tell. I think they fit best taking place sometime between episode 310 and 342, although there are still a few minor issues with this. The fourth filler arc, the reigai arc, is easily the best (the ending just about brought tears to my eyes) and fits in perfectly with continuity, so it for sure earns my badge of approval.",9,Recommended,"Sep 23, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_19b25dc623,9
"Being one of the 3 mainstream manga/anime, between One Piece and Naruto, I'd have to be inclined to say Bleach is the best. This is my opinion, however. Also - my first review. Please don't be too harsh. In regards to story, I gave it a 7/10. Soul Society and Heuco Mundo arcs were fairly well done with a unique plot and, in my opinion a pretty decent villian. What brought it down anymore is the current arc, and a few of the fillers in the anime such as the Bount arc which have no real decent effect on the story. Art wise 10/10. Tite has drastically improved his artwork, and mostly everyone can agree its a lot better than a lot of other manga artwork. This goes for the anime too. Sound 9/10. In the anime, I think the sound is done well, with good VA's in the Japanese version, with only a few who just don't match. Characters 9/10. Most can be fairly relateable since there are so many. If you don't like a lot of them, chances are you'll like at least one of them. Though some of them have little relevence to the story, like filler characters who show up in the anime, or Don Kanonji. 9/10 for enjoyment. For people who like a good shonen manga, or anime in general, I would reccomend this one for sure. 9/10 overall. Bleach has been one of my favourites for a long time, and I like most of the characters, and the story. I'll admit right now the manga is a bit stale, but with Bleach's lovely artwork, variety of characters, I think it's one of the best ones out there.",9,Recommended,"Aug 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b6f3b43d93,9
"Bleach. What can I say? You either like it or hate it. I loved Bleach. I've never done anything like this, this is my first review so please go easy on me guys! I'm not going to do a ""traditional"" review. I'm not going to give a rating on Bleach based on how good it was, I am going to give a review on Bleach based on how much I enjoyed it. It may be bias to you but I don't care this is my review, I'll do things my way. Bleach isn't a perfect anime nor will it ever be. It actually has many flaws, the most noted one is the amount of fillers. Note that I skipped just about all the fillers. I'm doing this review based on the canon stuff from Bleach which I enjoyed a lot. Bleach was the anime that got me back into anime. I stopped watching anime in my last year of Middle School which was in the 2007/2008 year. I was fairly familiar with the Bleach anime. I used to watch it sometimes on TV. I remember the hype of 3 animes back then in 2006/2007 , Naruto (which I was a huge fan of and always watched back then), Bleach (which I watched on TV sometimes and tried to watch online to get into) and One Piece (which I watched on TV, the 4kids version). Long story short, I could never really get into Bleach. I had plans to ""one day"" watch and catch up with Bleach because of the hype (and One Piece also). 5 years later in February of 2013, in my final year of High School in my Civilization class my teacher would sometimes talk about anime and I kept getting this weird sensation to watch Bleach it was like an itch. Something was telling me to watch Bleach, I kept remembering it in class. I kept imagining Ichigo killing ghosts. So I started watching Bleach, I gave the series time and I began to really love it. I took a lot of breaks with it though but a year later (February 2014) I finished it. I will always love Bleach and one of the reasons was for it restoring my love back in anime. I love the story, characters, music, fights, art and most of all I enjoyed it. I loved the story of Bleach which is often criticized by many. Ichigo wants to protect his friends and family and will do anything to do that. It was fun for me to see Ichigo find himself out of precarious situations. Soul Society is one of the greatest arc's I've ever seen in any anime. Bleach has many likeable characters, one of the problems is that there can be a lack of development. I liked almost every character in Bleach. Bleach has a plethora of unique characters. The character's are one of my favourite parts about Bleach. Bleach has amazing music, that does a VERY good job of setting the tone well. There's funny music for funny moments and very sad music for sad moments that do a good job of setting the tone and mood. The music is also very catchy and great to listen to. Especially in the Arrancar, Hueco Mundo and Fake Karakura Town arcs, a lot of Spanish kind of music (which I am listening to now!). Bleach has many good theme songs and ending songs which have a spot in my ipod. Not many complain about Bleach's music. Bleach has amazing fights, I'm not going to go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil for future watchers. Bleach's fights are very well paced and never take too long because of the fast pacing of the show. This is something that I think makes Bleach unique to many shounen animes that have fights go on for episodes on end. Bleach has long fights sometimes don't get me wrong, but the pacing for most the fights are perfect. Bleach art wise is perfect if you ask me. It's not too colourful, it's something you can take very seriously. The art for Bleach is one of the best things about the show. All in all coming to an end, Bleach wasn't perfect. It can be vastly overrated at times with fans saying it's the greatest anime/manga of all time. Bleach is one of my favourites, but I'll never claim that Bleach is better than everything. Bleach can be inconsistent and it has way too many fillers for most people's liking but what I enjoyed about Bleach was when it was canon it was pretty damn good IMO. I don't know what more to say other than I loved it. Bleach to me is a classic that I will rewatch many times. All I have to say is give it a chance once you get past the first 20 episodes it will be amazing for awhile and if you skip most the fillers you may really enjoy Bleach. (Some have said some fillers are pretty good, I wouldn't know though. I plan to watch them eventually). But yeah man, I love Bleach it helped get me back into anime and it has even taught me to protect my friends and family. I loved Ichigo as a main character. I just love Bleach and that is something no one will take away from me I don't care what anyone says. I hereby rate Bleach a 10/10 because I really enjoyed this series and to me that's all that matters whether I enjoyed it or not.",10,Recommended,"Feb 7, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6cc6c294c3,9
"Bleach is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I've come across.Though the only thing that makes this anime not better than Naruto or One Piece is the plot, I think sometimes they can get repetitive, though that doesn't stop the series from having some amazing brawls. The fillers... yeah they're boring [with the exception of the new zanpakuto arc]but it doesn't stop it's popularity [too much]. The soundtrack is really good, it creates a perfect spiritual atmosphere and the characters are diverse. In my opinion, you should give it a chance.",9,Recommended,"Oct 23, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1c21ca8ac6,9

"Bleach is the 2nd anime I have watched. I have no standards when I watched it so I pretty much enjoyed it. But as my anime time pass by I encounter masterpieces like Hunter x Hunter, FMA:B, etc..my standards rise. From a 7/10 due to my standards rise it is now a SOLID 3/10. Story: 3/10 Starts of with a Soul Reaper giving her powers to a powerless man because he needs to save his loved ones. How original. The storyline of Bleach is one of many stereotypical anime or shounen plots. Nothiing new. Not to mention that the Arrancar Arc is just a dragged out, more plot holes and inconsistencies, and more underdeveloped characters version of Soul Society Arc. This anime also introduced us to one of the worst concepts in anime, Fullbring *insert any laughing meme*. The story in this anime is just a repetitive cycle, making it extremely predictable and uninteresting. Characters: 3/10 Wow.....There are a lot. Did they develop? NOT. Bleach, for me, has the worst main casts in any anime I have watched (even Fairy Tail's cast is better IMO). The side characters are worse. Forgettable, bland, boring, uninteresting....The villains overstay their welcome to the point of making me say ""I dont want to see you anymore! Give me Aizen!!, especially in the Arrancar Arc. They will end up losing but they will pull a Diablous Ex Machina out of there butt and ""HAHAHAHAHA i HAVE BEEN SAVING THIS TRUMP CARD!!"". Overall it is a horrible cast but Bleach still has good characters like Yamamoto, Mayuri and Byakuya.

"This anime is a great ""starter"" anime. Yes, it is part of the big three that everyone associates anime with : Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, this may change with Fairy Tail moving up the list :). Put that aside, it's still a really interesting anime. The story itself is outstanding in the beginning. An ordinary teenage boy who can see ghosts runs into, and is run through, by a shinigami who literally jumps into his life and catapults him into the turmoil and hardships of being a shinigami. Ichigo doesn't just get his powers or his upgrades if you would like to call them. He has to go through hell every single time in order to face whatever crazy psycho that is destroying either the Soul Society or Karakura town. Over time, it does get into the whole Shounen rut. Some low level bad guys swoop down, beat up the main character, he has to go on some sort of spirit quest, comes back and single handedly wipes out the whole group. But, give it a break, the anime stopped in the 400s and the manga's in the 800s last time I checked! I say, if you haven't seen it, why not?",7,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e46ebb49f0,9
"I'll keep this brief. As many others have written, Bleach is a typical mainstream anime. As such it is basically a show written by formula; the formula which involves milking this cow for everything its worth. I watched the first part of the story (i would call it a season, except it took seventy something episodes to finish) it was alright the plot developed and as much as it seemed to take forever the show was enjoyable. After what little was resolved in this first adventure the show just goes on some other tangent about vampires or some such nonsense. I tried to stay interested, however I could not. The show seems to keep going for the sake of ringing its own bell. it just creates more plot tangents to make you forget about all the things that haven't been resolved, keeping you just curious enough to watch one more episode. So, chances are if you are reading this you already have seen Bleach, and probably seen more of it than i could handle, and your wondering why I'm badmouthing your favorite anime. well if you like it that's wonderful, but its not that special.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1aa80d9ca0,9
"I grew up watching a lot of the original shounen anime from Dragon ball, to dragon ball Z, to yuu yuu hakusho. When I was still a little kid, I genuinely enjoyed the dragon ball manga, and the anime. At the time it was unique, fresh, and extremely popular... and it still is. Because of that I was hesitant to try out Bleach since I heard that it was a copycat of yuu yuu hakusho, and the story was predictable to the nines... As it turns out, some of the rumors I heard turned out to be true, but there were still many redeemable points to the show. Story 4/10: The story is way too predictable and way too similar to other shounen anime. The main character with unusual ability to learn and become strong unnatrually fast. Hmm, where have I seen that before?? Because it borrows so much in terms of story elements from other shounen anime, you can kinda figure out what's going to happen at the end of an arc 20 or so episodes in advance. This type of anime is the same as DBZ, and yuu yuu hakusho. The good guys always win no matter what kind of set backs the characters face. Even the ""way"" the characters become stronger is too similar to earlier shounen anime. Eccentric teachers trying to draw out the hidden power in each main character to overcome their own limits and weaknesses. The ""similarity"" issue is just one aspect... other other aspect is all kinds of annoying inconsistencies in the Bleach universe that drive me nuts. Things from unusually powerful Aizen that is so much more powerful than anyone else, it doesn't make sense; a way too convenient way of explaining all the convenient occurrences throughout the series- hou***u; inconstant aging between the soul reapers etc etc etc... Finally... some of the arcs like the bount arc and the amagai shunsuke arcs are just atrocious... and many of the fillers are basically what the writers came up with when they were high on acid. Art 7/10: Early in the show, the animation was rough at best with the characters looking quite... strange. But as the series progressed so did the art, and now it looks pretty top notch. Sound 6/10: While the BGM is sometimes pretty nice, other times it is very irritating. Who ever decided, ""If you want to see some action..."" (or number 1"" by hazel fernandes) was a good song for a shounen anime needs to be shot. It sounds like crappy, cheezy 70's disco music. It just doesn't fit at all! There is some others that is awful and it sounds like an equivalent of someone's nails on chalkboard. There were also many ending and opening songs that were really bad as well. But there were some that were really good as well, like Ranbu no melody by Cid which is running in the current season as of feb 2011. Characters 7/10: Characters are decent in Bleach. Development is slow but they are interesting...BUT some are almost copy cats of other shounen anime characters. Lets compare Ichigo and Yuusuke from yuu yuu hakusho. They both get into fights, they are both seen as yankee's in high school, they are both eventually ""recruited"" by the other world or the soul society, and they aren't exactly human. They are both head strong, caring of others, and aren't bound by rules in the slightest. They don't talk politely, they are dense, they always win eventually, and very protective of others... especially Orihime/keiko. The renji-Ichigo relationship is also quite similar to Yuusuke-Kuwabara... Over time both characters become incredibly powerful throughout the series with the help of eccentric/odd mentors. You can say that many of these traits are similar in most shounen anime like Naruto also shares similar characteristics, as well as Son Goku... But ""that"" is what sells, and that is what gets people hooked. Enjoyment 7/10: Most of the enjoyment comes from some kind of ""addiction"" factor where you just have to see the next episode even though you know what's going to happen. Bleach does that VERY well, and it will keep you hooked, wanting to watch more until there isn't any left to watch. Same kinda formula that other very popular shounen anime used. Overall 6/10: It's not the best shounen anime, it's not very original, and it's quite predictable... but in the end you'll in the least enjoy the many action sequences, and the progression of the characters throughout the anime.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 6, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1f16cd01c9,9

"hero meets new enemy -> enemy is too strong -> seems like hero will lose -> something happens -> hero gets more powerfull -> hero beats enemy -> go back to step one. take that, add tons of fan service and stretch it across 300 episodes and you've got Bleach. on a more serious note: I really enjoyed bleach at first. it is quite faithfull to the manga so that is always a plus. the plot is actually quite interesting and the fight scenes are great and intense. alot better than Naruto IMO. but just like Naruto, the producers became greedy and they have stretched the story far too much. after watching literally hundreds of episodes and reading the manga, this show gets painfully repetetive and the plot takes extreamly long to thicken. basically its a great show that turned into garbage for being prolonged too much.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_031d847339,9
"Story: Bleach isn't really the type of anime that has to have deep, compliacted, mind bottling plot. It's not really the reason why I got drawn to watching and kept on watching it in the first place. For me the story of bleach is good as it is cause the only thing I watch bleach for is the action, cool art style, and awsome powers. Bleach is a pure ""Action Anime"". Though it doesn't have a complex plot to it. There's still alot of memorable moments in Bleach that i really loved. Art: It's also the other thing why I was drawn to bleach. It's Art style looks unique and epic that I hooked to bleach because of it. There's no other anime like it. Sound: The music in bleach is pretty awsome. The Ops and EDs are cool and suits the anime well. With awsome BGM that suits the mood of the episode pretty well. Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Bleach alot and I feel like I could watch the series over and over again and look back on how it all began and shit... etc :D Overall: For me.. Bleach is the best Action Anime I have ever seen. Nothing can top it in the genre of action.. To those of you who are just starting to watch bleach.. it's not really an anime with a mind bottling story cause bleach isn't really about that. The Fights, Powerups and the Moments is what bleach is really about. :D",10,Recommended,"Oct 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a472a00aa7,9
"Many people get caught up with the simpler aspects of Bleach and can't appreciate it for what it really is. You will often hear that it's all about the fight scenes, the enemies, the story arcs, or the evolution of the main character powering up, and thats its all the same. While those things are all part of the anime and frequently recurring themes, they are not the main driving force of the series. Bleach is a Character Development show, plain and simple. Everything else that happens is just there to provide filler, and an environment where the characters can be introduced and interact to gradually reveal their personalities, powers, traits and history. It's all about providing just enough to get you interested and wanting to see more. There are many small events or seemingly inconsequential occurences that can correlate hundreds of episodes later. In this regard, it is absolutely essential to rewatch Bleach at least once. For the new viewer, the sheer number of main and supporting characters can be overwhelming. To be honest for awhile it kind of turned me off until I really began to get what it was all about. It's also important to understand that while Ichigo is the main character, he's moreso there just to provide a common ground upon which all the different aspects of the show converge. He is not an overpowering lead or the centre of everything, and doesn't really have a particularly interesing personality. The attraction of Ichigo lies in the what and why and how, and the way he is percieved by others. The character art is fantastic - each character's personality is very accurately represented in their appearance. Nearly every character is interesting and has a lot of deep history, unanswered questions and mystery, many of which are so far left to the viewers imagination. Don't expect the same level of depth from the enemies, as they inevitibly all die. While nearly all of the Bleach Intro and End credits are absolute rubbish, the soundtracks are nothing short of masterpieces. Without a doubt, Bleach has the best and most fitting music of any long running anime series. A couple of the arcs aren't fantastic story-wise, and like any show it has its ups and downs so its important just to stick with it. Look away for a moment, and you can miss important clues and info. The second time around, things can make a lot more sense and suddenly seem a lot more interesting. Unfortunately I hate to admit that the first time I watched Bleach I was still a dub watching fanboy noob. Bleach changed all that, and rewatching the first 200 eps in Japanese was the best thing I could have done. The actual proper voice actors have a huge impact on overall watchability, and are amazingly fitting for each character. If you watch this show dubbed, you are losing a lot right there, so if you are going to bother watching Bleach i suggest doing it right and going subs. I've never watched dubs since, and in fact Bleach turned me into a hardline anti-dub viewer. As 'generic' and mainstream as Bleach's reputation can sometimes be, it is still probably one of, if not my favourite anime just for the complexity and depth of characters. Sadly i think a lot of people who watch Bleach just dont get it, id suspect mostly younger viewers. It's important to realise this isn't just some shallow kids crap like Dragon Ball Z. When the series was cancelled I was absolutely devastated since after 366 episodes there is still so much with regards to many characters not yet even touched on. I'm hoping that this is just a way to move past Ichigo as the main character, and a 'spin-off' is in the works.

"Bleach. One of the best animes i have seen so far. I watched all Episodes and i still want more. So overall Bleach is a typically ""boy saves world"" anime, BUT: Every caracter (including the side caracters) got their own story in what they believe, what they are fighting for and what had to pass through in their lives. You can realy understand the caracters and feel good/bad for them. The story itself is pretty long and you are so excided to see the final battle with ichigo vs. ...... The ""bad"" thing about the length of the anime is it has very much filler episodes. At the beginning of the first filler chapter i thought ""nah, i want to see the story again"" but if i watched more i didn't realy care if it was a filler ep or not. At every side story you learn more about the caracters and the filler stories are also very interesting. I spread the anime into 2 parts: 1. The Fighting scense: Realy cool fighting scenes where they go all out and destroy everything. I've never seen a anime where the fights are so genious. In other animes you think ""ah they are fighting"" but in Bleach you are totally into it and you don't know who wins. Ichigo learns more and more about his abillities in the fights and i was amazed every time he got all out and fought like there is no tomorrow. 2. The ""normal"" live part: You can see the caracers in their normal live, going to school, eating dinner with the family or meeting friends. These parts are very funny and it really hits my humor. The caracters provoke each other in such funny ways. Also there are some echi parts but nor too often. Alltogether its totally worth watching it. I love this anime and i want more of it.

Though it' not without its faults, of course there are the fillers and the draw out of the fights which annoy me but it still is amazing.

The first arc was written very well. Emotional, suspense, dramatic, awesome revelation, epic fight scene. I can't bring my words of the awesomeness of this show. Then, the main enemy appear. As far as I know, the enemy in this series is just one. The others are just his pawns. Then, the second arc begun. That's where the downfall begin. Too many characters, over-repeat fights and random power ups, too many plot holes, predictable outcome and a strong villain character died so pathetically killed by their own boss. Some of the characters died so quickly like they are bunch of fodder. But, the fallen of the main villain was the best of this series. Anyway, great art and animation. Best anime soundtrack I've ever heard. Character development is not that good. Only a few characters got developed but they have quite good flashback. What I enjoy the most in this series is not the plot, but the fight scenes. It can rival DBZ and beat Naruto and One Piece. Yeah, I said that.

"Have you ever seen an arguement between a Call of Duty fan and a Battlefield fan? The Call of Duty fan will always argue that ""graphics do not make the game"". Similarly in animes people will argue that the technical department comes second. WRONG! I'm not saying that graphics and sound are everything, but I am saying that each anime has its own highlights. And in Bleach's case, the technical superiority is so strong that even major flows like a gazillion plotholes or one of the worst senses of humor to ever exist in anime just don't matter. Remember Avatar? The movie was basically crap but it did so well on the technical part that you could easily forget the plot was basically white guy meets noble culture. For the basics: The anime's main theme is basically ghosts vs demons. Specifically samurai-like ghosts (shinigami) vs black masses with white masks on (hollows). Traitors appear on the side of the shinigamis and they side with an army of hollows so that their leader can become king of the spiritual world. Just to give an example of Bleach's plotholes... It was never actually explained WHY the traitor becoming king would be a bad thing. Granted it was a Coup De Tat but bringing peace between the shinigamis and the hollows isn't exactly a bad thing is it? The show pushes him as evil when really he never actually attacked anyone without being provoked (except for some kids in the end of the arc but really, who gives a ""$%^?). Anyway that aside the show's humor is TERRIBLE, which apparently the animators realised too at some point early on and completely cat off. The story is usually dark and the mangaka isn't afraid of axing off people. It should also be noted that half of the episodes are actually fillers. That said bleach actually follows filler arcs rather than Naruto's moronic off-and-on the main story switches. In addition, with the exception of the first filler arc (which wasn't all that bad either really) the filler arcs in bleach are actually good and they continuously get better, with the last filler arc being in fact as good as the main story if not better. In fact everything in Bleach improved as the episodes went on. Unlike some other animes (regarding pirates, ""cough"") Bleach matured with time, starting off as good and ending as a masterpiece. Now for the real deal: Technically Bleach is what the Dota announcer would call ""beyond godlike"". The visuals gradually improved (at the start of the anime they were awful truth be told). At the final arcs practically 3/4 of each episode's frames could easily be used as wallpapers, with amazing detail aesthetics (to clarify, the resolution isn't ALL that high but the guys at the shading and art department just knew what they were doing). The soundtrack also matured as time went on. While at the start of the anime it was impressive and by far the best soundtrack that had appeared in animation at the time, in the final arcs Bleach simply had one of the best ost collections to ever appear in media in general. ""Perfect"" is hardly enough to describe the music, which was excellantly used by the animators. Also important are the character designs, all of which are memorable and generally cool-looking, even for the most minor of characters. Hell, the character design of the most basic of hollows (which are basically there to die) is actually really intimidating. Character designs, moves transformations etc etc are all really well made, making it extremely hard to find a ""favourite"" among them. To focus more on the music part: In most animes the animators first make the video clip and THEN decide what music to add on top of it, cutting the songs so that they fit. In Bleach the animators actually did the opposite. First it was decided which soundtrack would be used in each scene of the manga (in fact I suspect that Kubo himself WROTE the manga with specific soundtracks in mind for each scene as time went on) and then the animation was made based on it. In the final arcs you will often notice that the screen remains a second or so longer than needed on the same image. That is done so that the next clip can start at the same time the ost's next beat starts (for example see ichigo's battle with tsukishima in episode 359, it's the one where I first noticed this detail, but it was actually being done for quite some time already). As a result of this the choreography of bleach is hands down AMAZING. Also as a result of this every battle, regardless of how small or trivial, or even of its participants, ends up being 100% memorable and pumping up. In other animes you will basically remember 2-3 scenes, the ones where the protagonist battles the big villain etc because of all the hype for the battle that the anime had busied itself creating. In bleach though most scenes will include a soundtrack that good that you will remember them without a problem (along with the soundtrack that was playing at the time). Bleach's osts range from extremely sad memorable themes (for example Torn Apart), to memorable techno-metal beats (BL 57 Sakkaku being a good example) and to memorable choirs (Treachery, Stand Up be Strong, etc etc). Pay attention to the word ""memorable"". Bleach might have a loooot of problems but in the end it does so incredibly well on the technical part that they are all easily ignorable. For those that HAVEN'T watched Bleach yet, I do suggest watching just the final arc (eps 343-366) to learn what technical perfection means (no need to have seen the previous episodes, you'll soon understand what's going on easily).",10,Recommended,"Sep 4, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6f4a9aee27,10
"Ok so this might be a very bias review because Bleach is the best anime i have ever watched. The filler is ok but as to the main story line it is easily my favorite story that i have ever come in contact with. Tite Kubo is a genius for thinking up this story from thin air and to keep it as interesting as it is for so long. The Soul Socitey arc really caught my attention and i couldnt stop watching it from there. If it werent for so many filler arcs i would give this anime a 10/10 without a doubt. I have watched this anime twice through and i love it the same both times. The storyline of a human becoming a soul reaper and becoming one of the strongest in the squads really appeals to me. I love bad ass anime characters. The ones that are super strong and you watch become super strong over time. This is what happens with my favorite character of all time Ichigo Kurosaki. There are many turns that you dont see coming if you dont look into the spoilers. I have recommended this many times to my friends and they love it too. I also read the manga of this so i dont really want to spoil such an amazing story for you. the amount of villians that i like in this is unbelivable. i love villains in anime they are like my favorite parts about an anime. If the series doesnt have a villian that i like then i sometimes end up dropping the anime becuase i get so bored of it. In bleach there are 3 villians that i will always remember for as long as i live. Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, and Aizen. If they continue this anime i would be so happy that i might die. lol The new arc that is supposibly the final arc in the manga is happening at the moment and boy is it good. So for all of you wanting to watch an incredible supernatural story where you watch a kid from a small town turn into a bad ass shinigami i would recommend this 100% lol",9,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_128a0fca13,10

"Ok well Bleach, is a very popular anime. None the less one that i really enjoy. Theres a lot of problems with it though. The filler is the worst ive seen. Oh god the bount ark. The rest of the stories are pretty good, its the filler that gets me down in most of these though. Its like story wouldve been a 9 without filler, enjoyment wouldve been a 9 too. So really it brought down a lot. The zombatos are cool, the characters are outsanding. The sounds pretty good. Along with the dub is good too. So really skip filler, and you might be bored, when they drag on fights. Well i guess its an 8. Warning: During fillers they also dont care about the art as well. So the fillers ultra worse, cause the art sucks along with it being horrible.",8,Recommended,"Nov 6, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_66883deff5,10
"Bleach is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I’ve come across. Of course, with all the time it gets for character and plot development by being a long-running anime, it’s a good run almost no matter what your preferences are. I rate this anime 5, not because it’s the most awesome anime I’ve ever seen(Gurren Lagann takes that spot) nor does it have a plot that keeps me sitting in constant expectation(Death Note does that better), but because not only does it give you plenty of time to get to love it, when the big plot twists do come they come from out of nowhere, even with all the - very effective - foreshadowing throughout the series. Another thing that keeps you interested is of course what each character will do and, perhaps most of all, what their powers are. Each shinigami wields a zanpakuto(lit. ""soul-cutter sword"") which is both a weapon and a partner. Seeing the ""released"" power of a new zanpakuto is always interesting, even later in the series. Lastly, I would like to talk about filler. As most of you know, filler is bad. As considerably fewer of you know, filler is at times a necessary evil. For your own sakes, I highly recommend that you do not take the first filler arc(Bounto) too seriously. It leaves you with 3 new characters(that are non-canon and thus mostly appear in later fillers) but other than that it has no real impact on the plot. Still, a few nice fights, although animation is kinda poor. The second filler arc(Amagai) is way different, and(this is another reason for those 5 stars) does not IN ANY WAY impact the main story, as it doesn’t pretend to be part of the storyline, and instead ""sometime else"" with no affiliation as to what is currently happening in the real story. It’s also much more well animated(you’ll find that Bleach improves its animation greatly over the course of the show) and the story is actually quite good. The Zanpakuto Unknown Tales filler arc has just begun, but it looks awesome ^^ So if you haven’t watched Bleach, or got tired of it after 2-3 eps, take my word for it and try it out for the first 25 at least. There’s always fast-forward^^ Sincerely, renji59",10,Recommended,"Jun 8, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_669843f473,10
"Bleach is a very well made anime, it has decent character development and has a overall good storyline.The animations are of a typical anime series.The animations in the beginning have a more manga style to them but later on it changes, During fillers the animations seem stiff. except for the last one. Also towards end the animations seem a bit half a**.There is also alot of censorship on some of the more bloody scenes. The OST is excellent and the openings and endings are great. The character design is great and the show has alot of character diversity in race and personality, for example they have Mexican,Japanese (of course),African American,and German characters. Each faction represents a culture. All of these are the reasons for why i watched and enjoyed this anime. Besides the excessive filler its a great anime and i would highly recommend it to any person who loves sword fighting and supernatural anime.",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3a9bb14bb7,10
"I have a serious love/hate relationship with Bleach. While the overall story and battle scenes are usually pretty intense and rewarding, they are too few and far between. In order to get to the meat of the anime, you are forced to wade through hours of boring dialogue and lame slice-of-life episodes that seem way out of place. While I (somewhat) appreciate Bleach's attention to explaining how the characters' powers work, it is overdone to the point where battles lose all significance and weight due to the bland and lengthy explanations. Bleach's biggest problem is the fact that it tries to take 10 episodes worth of a story arc and draw it out until it's around 30-40 episodes, which makes the story for each arc seem slow and repetitive. I think you would be surprised by how much of this show is just filler. For a 25 minute show, approximately 8 minutes of it is spent with the opening, recap and ending (Thats almost a THIRD of each episode). Then once you get to the actual show, you get to see one or two cool attacks before the characters go into lengthy dialogue describing their special abilities, their reasons for fighting, etc., etc. All in all, I can't say I would recommend this anime. While the fights are sometimes pretty cool and the story has a few redeeming qualities, the show is far too slow and repetitive to be worth watching all the way through.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 23, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_19c37b430b,10
"So, Bleach is a very over rated anime, people either really love it or really hate it. I personally really love it, but that's probably because it's the first anime I watched, so it does hold a special place in my heart. Story- 8: I love the story, it's well developed and has a lot of backstory to it. What made it less good... THE FILLER! They needed to calm down. Step back. Wait for more of the manga to be published, not add a filler every few episodes. Art- 8: The art was nice but nothing special, until it came to fight scenes. When there was fights the art was really pretty *cough* senbonzakura kageyoshi *cough* Sound- 9: The music fits so well and just makes fights really intense and yeah, bleach has some of the best anime music I've heard. Character: 8- Some just need more air time, like c'mon if they're going to make 366 episodes with a tonne of filler can they not make some of that filler useful?

"Bleach, the story of the Orange haired high school Shinigami, used to be my favorite anime and is still an enjoyable part of my week. If you are looking for a life changing deep and meaningful story, look elsewhere. Bleach is a fast paced action comedy with one of the biggest casts of characters I've ever seen. Not the best anime I've ever seen (which I will explain further) but definitely worth a watch... at least for a while. Story: 7/10 If this show had stopped after the Soul Society ark I would have rated the plot as a 9 or 10, but after that the plot has only gone downhill. The begining of the series did a god job of balancing humor and action while explaining the way Bleach's world works, as well as introducing a HUGE cast of characters in a way that was fun and engading. All the way through the Soul Society ark it was felt like Kudo Tite had a clear plan for where his story was going, the problem is that by the time he got there the series popularity was at it's peek and he was left scrambling for ideas, drawing the series out with constant battles with flat uninteresting characters while he tries to figure out what the hell to do with the runaway train that is Bleach. That's not even taking into acount the nessicary evil to any long series, filler. The current ark is still watchable, but not up to the standard of the earlier plot ark. Art: 7/10 When Bleach's art is good, it's fantastic. One thing I love about Kubo's work is that as the series went on and his style evolved, everyone got ridiculously hot. My God some of the art is downright droolworthly at times! Unfortunately when Bleach's art is bad, it's horrible. The beginning of the series was so over contrasted I don't quite know what they were thinking, but fortunately they tone it down as time goes on. Some of the filler ark's animation is clearly sub par and dissapointing compared to the quality expected by the time the series gets that far. Overall the artwork inconsistant, but fair. Sound: 9/10 The 9 is for the original Japanese dub, we'll get to the English in a moment. I enjoy pretty much all the Seiyuu (Paku Romi!!!) and can't think of any complaints I have about it. The music is fun and oddly appropriate. ""Number One"" which often plays in Ichigo's moments of triumph cracks me up, just awesome. I also enjoy the fact that more Spanish sounding music is worked in as the Arrancar are introduced. As for the English dub, first note that I am by no means a dub hater, but I must say that Bleach is one of the more dissapointing dubs out there for me. I have never been a huge fan of Viz, and this series did nothing to endear me to them. With a cast so huge, there are bound to be people I like, such as Ichigo (done by Johnny Yong Bosch) who sounds incredibly appropriate. Hanataro, Orihime, Mayuri, Urahara and (oddly enough) Gin are also some of my English dub favorites. On the other hand I absolutely cannot stand Renji, Byakuya, Ishida, Shunsui, Kira, Hitsugaya and Matsumoto to name a few. Add on top of that the horrendous pronunciation of half the names and places and it's enough to make me want to pull my hair out. To someone who has never seen the Japanese it's probably quite palatable, but I have been spoiled. Characters: 10/10 I'd say this is/was Bleach's strong suit. There is such a fun, fascinating and massive cast of characters that there's sure to be someone you'll like. I tend to only really latch onto an anime (or any story) if I care about the supporting characters, of which Bleach has no shortage. The only downside to such a large cast is that if your favorite is anyone other than Ichigo, chances are you won't see them all that often, and only after other side characters have had their time in the sun as well. Luckily so many of the characters are interesting and unique that no matter who pops up it's typically not dissapointing. As the series goes on the characters seem to have less of a personality (the Arrancar are prime examples), but are still often pretty, and usually entertaining in some way. The great characters in Bleach is probably the main thing that keeps me watching. Enjoyment: 7/10 Though the plot evenually becomes an endless stream of fighting with little point, that's really what Shounen is all about I suppose, and the fights are fairly well done at least. The humor is good (even the filler stuff is mostly acceptable) and the general mood is pretty fun. Overall: 7/10 I would absolutely recommend this series to anyone through the Soul Society ark, then tell them to not bother with the rest and let it end on a good note. But if your anything like me, by the time the Soul Society ark is over you want MORE, because this show and it's characters is Goddamn catchy and addictive. So even if you can't pull away when it's peek has passed, you will still likely enjoy the ride as you go down with the ship. When looking for a Shounen anime to pass the time, you really can't go wrong with Bleach.",7,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7c477fc467,10
"Firstly, I have to say its not easy to rate an anime like bleach, an anime which has a few arcs are very like to have one or two arcs which aren't very good. The storyline for bleach was at its best at the first Arc where ichigo has to save rukia .This is where the story was far more complicated and unpredictable compared to the later arcs. The storyline in the later arcs is just beat up bad guys. A major weakness in the anime is the fillers, fillers generally generate a lot of hate among the anime fans. For one, ichigo's bankai . One of the best scenes for bleach was when he first used his bankai againt kuchiki byakuya , during the fight ichigo looked so strong . However when he used bankai in the fillers in the later episodes he looked so silly and weak. In the fillers, he was never consistent, this is a very bad downside. The art for bleach was actually very good for its time of production. However, the fillers spoiled much of it . the art for some of the fillers were horribly made. But overall id say the art for bleach is fairly good. Sound, the sound for bleach really gets you into the mood when u first hear it especially those boss fight scenes. The character for bleach was very good in the beginning, especially in the first arc. His last progress for me was when he fought ulquiorra on top of the hollow dome. When he unleashed his full hollow powers, and then later on unleashing getsuga. But the progress from his bankai to his later powers are very slow and bad. I felt that ichigo should have learn some kidou (magic) . And make the fight scenes more tactical . So the fight scenes will become more intelligent rather than just beating the enemy time after time. I really enjoyed the first arc of bleach. It was the best. The later arcs was not so bad. One of the most recent arc with Ginjo in it left a distaste in my mouth. In my opinion, they should have ended it when Aizen got beaten by ichigo after he used getsuga. The biggest weakness for bleach was the fillers and the lack of abilities and the ginjo arc, if they had managed this factors, I would have given bleach a much better review probably scoring a 9. I believe bleach is overrated because of the reviews given by new anime viewers. Those new anime viewers are probably inexperienced and would compare their anime to cartoons rather than anime to anime overall in that genre. Overall, Bleach was one of my favourite anime's but I would only give it a 5.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 20, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2d1fb77805,10
"Are you looking for an anime filled with adrenaline? If you want to embark yourself on an extraordinary adventure, you are definitely in the right place. Bleach is the type of anime that will make you go from feeling every single emotion like you've never felt them before to leave your heart aching from one moment to another. It's hard to make every single character lovable but in Bleach everything is possible. You will find yourself in a constant inner battle, trying to decipher which character is the best but let me tell you, you will be wasting your time because there will always going to be better ones about to introduce themselves. There's a lot of dissatisfaction because of the amount of fillers in this anime but I don't really get how that can downgrade an entire anime. It's simple as if you don't want to watch the fillers then search for them and skip them. Basing your opinion merely on that fact and continuously comparing it to the other big animes is what kills the enjoyment of watching something. If you want to start watching Bleach, don't do it thinking in One Piece or Naruto, each one of them is different in their own way and that doesn't necessarily make them worse or better. Of course there are some flaws but just like life itself, Bleach teaches us that nothing can be perfect yet even in those times we need to keep on walking and appreciate what we have. It teaches us that friendship and family is what keeps us alive, what gives us the power to fight whatever comes next. Strength is not only found in the way you fight but in the way your heart functions. Strength is shown in different forms because everybody has their own strength.",10,Recommended,"May 18, 2025",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d5f9a69473,10
"Ah, where do I even begin with this festering pile of excrement called ""Bleach""? The truth is I really wanted to like bleach, I had heard lots from my friends and expected great things from one of the most influential shonen of all time. Instead, Bleach turns out to be an abomination to the art of storytelling, a disgrace to the anime medium, and an insult to anyone with an iota of intelligence (in my very cool and honest opinion, that is not written as a rant nor as an appeal to first time viewers for them to not watch bleach due to my review tehe~). PLOT (2/10) Let's start with its nonsensical plot that jumps around like a deranged kangaroo on crack. Seriously, Kubo Tite must have been snorting lines of pure insanity when he penned this garbage. Arcs in Bleach appear to materialize and dissipate seemingly at random, populated by forgettable villains who fail to leave a lasting impression (save for a scant few). This haphazard storytelling concocts a snooze-inducing spectacle that had me more preoccupied with adjusting my orbs with a few scratches than actually paying attention to the screen. (And let's be clear, such is an obvious jest, as my penchant for critiquing anime far outweighs any hypothetical affinity for groin-based activities.) But wait, there's more!! Bleach's most beloved power system, which I think is related enough to the plot for me to not make a new category for it. The labyrinthine labyrinth of Bleach's power system, or should I say, the labyrinthine labyrinth of convoluted absurdities, mess of ass-pulls, divine interventions and deus ex machinas that Kubo conjured from the depths of his fevered nightmares. Bankai, Shikai, Quincy, Hollows—what the hell is this nonsense? It's like Kubo threw every random idea he had into a blender and hit the ""puree"" button. I just can't get behind it. CHARACTERS (1/10) The characters? Don't even get me started on those cardboard cutouts with delusions of depth. Ichigo, the brooding protagonist with the personality of a wet sponge, is about as compelling as watching paint dry. All that unfolds, to possibly the worst character I have ever read, is that he was super chosen to be all the cool races so he could have all the cool powers and, sometimes, occasionally, he'll belt out a rallying cry about friendship or some other sort of such drivel. If one was looking for protagonists akin to the one found in 'Solo Levelling,' then Bleach might be exactly what one is looking for but for me, it's a resounding disappointment. And yet, could it be any more mind-numbingly boring? Oh, most definitely... it probably could. Enter the sprawling ensemble cast of Bleach—a motley crew of characters who, aside from occasionally showcasing flashy attacks, serve mainly as fodder for the narrative's erratic whims. Get ready for a rollercoaster ride as you ping-pong between various characters engaging in skirmishes with supposedly 'important' side villains, each encounter more underwhelming than the last. And don't even get me started on Orihime, the epitome of uselessness and vapidness. This walking pair of tits serves no purpose other than to scream ""Ichigo-kunnnnn~~~"" like a brain-dead parrot on repeat, I could not stop banging my head on the wall whenever she was on scream and I imagine I would not be alone in this sentiment. Seriously, her entire character seemingly consists of being purposefully useless, it's pathetic, nauseating, and a disgrace to female characters everywhere. Rukia, for example, may have her flaws, but at least she has some semblance of depth compared to this vacuous waste of ink and pixels. ANIMATION (3/10) The animation quality. Studio Pierrot must have outsourced their animation to a bunch of drunken monkeys with Parkinson's disease. The fight scenes are about as fluid as a constipated elephant trying to tap dance. Nothing much for me to say, it wasn't very good, but it didn't feel like enough to be very mediocre either. SOUNDTRACK (6/10) It's alright. Good songs here and there, nothing special. In the end, maybe it is special, as it is easily the only good part of Bleach. OVERALL (1/10) Despite all its glaring flaws, there are still droves of people who worship at the altar of ""Bleach."" This same, clueless, people probably think ""Naruto"" is high literature. Bleach was likely their first foray into anime, and they cling to it like a security blanket, terrified to venture beyond its putrid confines... Terrified of seeing anime as actual interesting art and compelling narratives. I simply can't get it, and I probably never will. In conclusion, Bleach is a steaming pile of hot garbage masquerading as entertainment. If you have even an ounce of taste or dignity, steer clear of this dumpster fire and find something worthy of your time, otherwise be prepared to feel like sticking your head in a blender and hitting the ""puree"" button. Surprisingly, I think even that would've been a more productive use of my time than watching Bleach.",1,Not Recommended,"Apr 2, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e6704dcc18,10

"An anime that was really iconic during its time; It was produced during the early 2000s and it was a quintessential A-tier closely up there with the likes of Naruto, One Piece, DBZ and such during its height. Although there are some factors that really stained its ratings for me and I'd discuss it in this review. Nonetheless if you got time to kill, I don't mind recommending it. Animation (7.5/10) - It has a trademark that was nice for its era, also throughout the entire 366 episodes you would see its animation quality slightly evolve which was an indication that its producers actively spent some time and money during its run. Although on some fights it feels like they are reusing frames which was a common thing for older, action-based animes. Nonetheless, I do not think it'd hurt your viewing experience in any major way. Storyline (5/10) - Do not get me wrong, its major arcs were great and entertaining. But the way this anime pumps out its filler episodes is through arcs and you'd have to mostly sit through 15-30 episodes of nothing but canon stories which is agonizing. Also, its pacing in general is a little slow. Probably because they are trying to maximize their television runtime then but still, I personally think its these two factors that really held the show back for what its worth. Could've had a higher score, seriously. Soundtrack (8/10) - Its music library and sound engineering was good! I personally liked it. They have a flexible selection of music ranging from rock, ballad, J-Pop and such that they chose for their intros and extros, and all the sounds and ambience effects they utilized were really atmospheric and distinct.

"I first started watching Bleach when I was around 9 years old. The storyline started off great, with the Soul Society arc, and the foreshadowing was amazing when Aizen was allegedly found dead. The many characters in Bleach really brought out Kubo's amazing work. I mean, all the characters had different yet similar personalities and traits, such as Ikkaku Madarame and Kenpachi Zaraki who both loved to fight but were different in the way they fight, as Zaraki refused to use the help of his Zanpakuto and Ikkaku used his, even to the extent of a Bankai. There were many rivalries and competitions, such as Renji wanting to defeat his Captain Byakuya Kuchiki, and how Ichigo and Renji competed with each other. I would say that the best thing about Bleach would be the music/soundtrack. For example, the fighting soundtracks in the battles between enemies was awesome. Notable ones are B13A, Stand Up Be Strong, and many more. Objectively, this was and always will be my ALL-TIME favorite anime, no matter what happens in the future.

"Bleach is excellent despite having quite a few flaws. For example, there are a lot of fillers that go in all directions and are generally not very interesting. Despite this, it didn't stop me from loving Bleach because these flaws don't bother me, and other qualities make up for them. Starting with Ichigo and Orihime Inoue. For Ichigo: He is the most endearing and badass character in the anime, in my opinion. However, the path to being badass is difficult for him. At the beginning of the anime, Ichigo leads a completely ordinary high school life until the day Rukia comes to protect him from a Hollow that came to devour his family's souls. Having been injured because of him, Ichigo agrees to become a Shinigami himself to save her. He has always been different from others, not only because of his naturally orange hair but also because he can see ghosts. With a rather dark, direct, and even rough character, Ichigo is very protective of his friends and family. However, his ability to see ghosts and the need to hide it make him quite reserved. As the story progresses, his reserved nature gradually disappears, and he goes from being an enemy of the Soul Society to a recognized and respected Substitute Shinigami. His power earns him the respect of most Shinigami. He is certainly one of the nakama I would like to have. And Orihime: Unfortunately, she is the most criticized and one of the least appreciated characters in the anime. She is reproached for being ""useless in combat, whiny, silly, pure fan service, and for not evolving."" I think these comments are extremely harsh! Besides, I didn't find her that sexualized despite her large breasts. Maybe it's because Orihime attracts all the attention with often ridiculous sequences. However, it's a shame to limit oneself to that because she makes progress over the episodes in using her ""Six Flowers of Shun Shun"" power. Through courage and selflessness, she has become a formidable fighter! With her kindness, Orihime is very adorable! The other main characters are generally charismatic and endearing despite the number of characters in the anime. There is little fan service, which makes it enjoyable to watch. There are only two characters with large breasts: Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto.",10,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bca0f871c1,11
"This is my first review on MAL. Being aware of the fact that Bleach is not the best anime, it is my favourite one. I will try to be as honest as possible. Story: 7/10 From my point of view, the weakest point of this anime. Even though the story is good, if you compare it with One Piece or Naruto, it is not that good. The main problem is that the two main arcs are based on the rescue of a secondary character, there is no a deeper reason behind. Anyway, both Soul Society and Arrancar arcs are great with decent plots. Art: 9/10 Taking into account that Bleach was a weekly anime, the animators put a great effort on it. The design of the characters is fantastic, the fights and openings are animated amazingly and, with some exceptions, the whole anime has a pretty good animation. I am particulary impressed with the animation of the second half of the Arrancar arc. Sound: 10/10 With no doubts, the best of Bleach. Nobody can deny that Bleach's OST is magnificent, so many epic soundtracks that suit with the epic fights, sad songs that suit with sad moments. From my point of view, one of the best OST of all anime, having 3 or 4 of the most epic songs in anime. Besides, most of the opening' songs are also fantastic, such OP 2,12 and 13. Character: 8/10. There are two parts here. On one hand, the main character has not a great development throughout the story. I especially miss that lack of development , i am not going to lie. Besides, the ""main"" secondary characters do not also experience it, being forgotten in many cases. On the other hand, i must say i am in love with almost all the captains of Gotei 13 and Espadas, along with Aizen and Urahara. Many of these characters, like Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ulquiorra... are undoubtedly iconic, which makes Bleach have plenty of epic and likeable characters. Enjoyment: 9/10. I must confess that, at the beginning, i did not like Bleach that much. The first 20 episodes were ok, but it had nothing special which made me love it. However, as new characters were appearing (the captains, Aizen, etc.) i was enjoying it more and more. But it was not until the appearence of Espadas that i completely fell in love with this anime, up to the point that i was not able to stop watching it, enjoying every single episode. Perhaps it is the kind of anime that suits the most with my liking, but being honest i enjoyed it a lot. Overall: 9/10 Some of you may agree, and some of you may not agree, but if you are interested in shonen animes and you want to give a try to 300 episodes, i strongly recommend watching Bleach, my favourite anime.",9,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0300b91a2a,11
"Bleach is my favorite Piece of media . I didnt grow up with it and watched plenty other shows before it, namly Naruto, Deathnote and Code Geass for example. However Bleach was the first time a show really gave me this feeling of watching something that is made for me. It resonates with me a lot more than i thought a piece of fiction could. Story: For a Shounen, i think Bleachs story is far greater than People would give it credit for. Afterarll you got the entire framework of Urahara and Aizen playing 3D-Chess with everyone, Ichigos power and everything regarding his own inner conflict, himself rejecting his (Hollow)powers , the Way Aizen outplays SoulSociety, the story unfolds and the characters and their battles actually have meaningful conclusions without using the common anime troupes such as Narutos sweettalking the villain is just satisfying. For example , Ichigo vs Byakuya. This is a conflict between Ichigo and him basically declining the entirety of Soul Societys (outdated) rules and Byakuya who wants to uphold those rules. However trough the fight and the few lines they share in that fight Byakuya finally ""loses "" , aka he accepts his mindset was wrong, Ichigo literally doesnt tell him "" i understand you "" or "" we are similiar "", instead he tells him, "" i still dont get it , if i was in your position i still would have acted differently "" There is many moments like this , but this is what i wanted to highlight. Art: For the time Bleach looks fantastic, compared to modern Standards maybe not so much, but i actually think it aged quite well and still has good animation and a beatiful art style, the manga however is better in that department. There is so many iconic Shots and scenes in Bleach, so many beatiful abilities and Moments. Sound: Bleach has by far the best OSTs ive ever heard in any media. Undeniably. Shiro Sagisu is just a mastermind, and he went all out for Bleach. ""Precipe of Defeat"" ""Number One"" ""Stand up be Strong"", pretty much all Openings and the spanish soundtracks to just name a few . There is a lot more tho. Characters: This gotta be the best thing about this show. Not only my favorite character / protagonist of all time in Ichigo, but also my favorite Villain with Aizen. Half of the captains are just Top Tier characters , if not more. Kenpachi, Byakuya, Toshiro, Yamamoto, Shunsui, Ukitake, Mayuri, there is to many to count. All of them are unique , somehow even tho they all wear a black uniform with a white haori they still have some of the most unique design in all of anime ( literally all of them as well) . The Vice Captains are also just amazing. Renji, Ikkaku, Rangiku and many more. Outside of these we got one of the best Dads in anime , akka Ishin, we got Urahara , my favorite teacher in anime and two candidates for ""Best girl"" with Yoruichi and Rukia ( not that there arent more) . Villains like Ulqiorra and Grimmjow werent even needed with how amazing Aizen is , but they still are there. I know no show that has such a big cast , and manages to develop so many of them, make so many of them this memorable. Especially considering that BLeach actually only has around 180 canon episodes, this is impressive, and ofc the last Arc will increase this even more. Enjoyment: There is not a single show that will ever reach the levels of hype and enjoyment for me , that Bleach delivered. Ichigo has to many badass moments to count, i get chills on all his transformations. The fights are just the best in anime, namely Ulqiorra vs Ichigo would be my favorite. The chills when Aizen outsmarts everyone, when he literally wipes a bunch of captains.. nothing has ever reached this same hype to me. The OSTs, beatiful visuals , the fun cast and amazing setting , the mysteryious atmosphere (Especially in the first arcs) and so much more contribute a lot to this. Conclusion: Bleach is the best show i have ever watched and i stand by this opinion for years. There was a single time a show gave me similiar feelings with "" Steins Gate"" . But really this show may not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me. Its honestly just everything i want from a Shounen. Atmosphere , Characters , Fights , Osts, emotional moments, Hype, Badass Designs, Good Writing and development , what more can i ask for ?",10,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5570d4d92a,11
"*Mild Spoil* This anime was great and I enjoyed most of the moments which I passed to see this anime . the soundtrack was great especially during battles and sensitive moments . the build up of charracters was also great , the development and improvement of Ichigo , Renji , Madarame , Chad and etc . Of course filler episode would bother you especially the the filler which on that the princess appeared in the living world but I cant blame the cast ( because they started it on the middle of the fight ) .maybe on that time the anime had reached the manga so they should do that or maybe for other reason that I dont know .Whatever , because i watched it in 2021 I could easilly skipped the fillers ( Which I didnt ) . but the worst thing of fillers was that all of the filler villains , suicide themself . actually i find it very ridiculous . there was some other issues for anime watchers ( I dont know that manga answered these questions or not ) : What happened to nel?did she die ? I myself expect that she would join Ichigo's squad ( like Renji ). what happened to ashedo ? did he get back to soul society or not ? Tsukushima didnt die so Chad and others shouldnt be able to take their original memories back , but they get . why ? Despite all of them , I think Bleach is the best Long anime which I've ever seen . it has comedy , drama, action together . and all of them in best forms. of course it could be better , because nothing is perfect but with considering the time which they made this anime , I think it was their best effort . and they have my respect for this beautiful masterpiece and I'm counting moments for the series which is going to be make",10,Recommended,"Sep 6, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4bb03b8d49,11
"Story - The story of bleach is a bit slow on the uptake, but after the first 20 or so episodes, it gets into it and becomes a fast-paced action packed anime - until the fillers kick in. The world that bleach is set in contains some interesting villains, the creatures known only as 'hollows' and other races that are introduced later - and what anime can go without a traitor among them? Also, the 'good' side are filled with their fair share of characters, and each one is given a story behind them which gets explained, so all in all the story goes really in-depth as far as characters go. However, the storyline - this is one that I'd give top marks, all the time you'll be baffled by the feats the main character achieves, the things that happen that you'd not think of in a million years - it makes you think that a genius must have come up with it. But enough about the story, I'll let you give your own verdict on that - but I give it a 10/10, sure some people might think it should lose marks for the slow uptake, but the truth is it's really deep, and the slow uptake sets the scene for later on. Art - In Bleach the art is brilliant, but sometimes they don't do enough FPS and it seems as if it's lagging slightly and has some weird still images in true berserk style (nothing against berserk, it's amazing. Just saying ;)). However, the art is amazing, and the detail given to the characters is true to the storyline, each and every aspect of the characters are there for a reason, right down to the hairpins or the belt buckles! Sound - It depends on which you're talking about... the dubbed, or the subbed. Not much to say about the dubbed version, I don't like the voices that are given to some characters, one of the main characters that's supposed to be a bit tough has a really squeaky voice and pronounces everything wrong. Whereas the way some of them speak, like a little girl in episode 1 - who speaks that politely!? I've got alot to say about the subbed version - the subtitles given are usually good translations (depending on the sites you use) and if you can understand japanese, great. I personally think that the voice actors for each character is fitting, and reflects that char's personality well. For example the main char. I spoke about in the dubbed part, they're given a voice that makes them sound like they're tough and they've been through alot - yet they're still young and inexperienced. And the language, again the little girl - she talks much less formally and it all sounds more easy and realistic. I've given sound a 9 because overall, I think the sound is amazing, but when talking about the anime as a whole, the dubbed version lets it down in places. Character - The anime is given true character, I've watched alot of anime that I can't even list them all on here because I've forgotten the names of half of them and still - I see that this anime is truly original, I don't see anything that's been taken from other animes. The way in which the characters are portrayed, the things that they've added in, the way everything works, the world itself, it's all original! It's amazing! The characters are full of personality, full of mystery, and full of their own little perks. All the characters, even some that only appeared once are given their own storyline and get a detailed biography given, why they act the way they do, what happened before to make them like they are. In true style, the good things that we always want to know are kept a mystery so that it makes us think and conjure up our own solutions until it's explained - I'm not really good at wording this that much but the characters are truly outstanding in my opinion - hence the 10/10 that I cave it. Enjoyment - what can I say, I'm into this anime and I love it. I read the manga and I still enjoy the anime. This anime has given me hours upon end of enjoyment, I love watching the storylines, the fights, the puzzles, and even some of the corny fillers. This anime couldn't give me anymore enjoyment - it's impossible - It's given me everything I could possible take and more already. Overall - Overall this anime has an amazing story, great art, great sound, the anime has truly amazing character, and the characters are so good you feel like crying when something happens to them, or you sit there jumping for joy when the bad guys gone! This anime, over all I gave a 9, because I think the dubbed version lets it down and some of the low fps scenes also let it down. This anime is definitely worth watching, even if you're not into action animes, this anime has a bit of everything, puzzling times, action, even comedy and fun. However if you watch it, watch the SUBBED version! Also I'd suggest reading the manga because the manga contains some truly valuable information that can't be found in the anime! I love this anime - it's still going and almost 300 episodes! 9/10",9,Recommended,"Apr 22, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bcea3c2fce,11
"Story Bleach has a very interesting story that gives both suspense and extreme action. Whether it be battling giant monsters or evil dominators Bleach has it all! Loses points for lousy plot fillers. Art The art style of Bleach is fairly similar to that of Naruto. The art is clean and fresh yet lacks detail compared to anime such as Full Metal Alchemist, Haruhi Suzumiya and Soul Eater. Although... It does however have some of the greatest fight art ever seen in anime. Sound The soundtrack of Bleach whether it be the openings, endings or backing tracks are incredibly diverse and suit the mood well. Character The colourful cast of Bleach makes the anime all that more entertaining from the crazy nature of Isshin Kurosaki to the overly ditsy nature of Orihime Inoue. However some characters can get a little annoying. Enjoyment Considering the anime isn't even finished yet it's enjoyable and suffers some slight drawbacks however, the awesome fights and exciting arcs make up for that loss. Overall Bleach is a really good anime and I do recommend you watch it. Atleast until you've completed the Soul Society arcs. 9/10",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45a4313ca1,11
"Bleach is one of the most well known anime series in the world. Ever since I discovered Bleach and began watching it back in the summer of 2011, I was introduced not only to the world of Bleach, but I found the huge world of anime as well. Despite being a big Bleach fan, I understand the show has lots of flaws and I can understand why people would dislike it, though I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. The story for Bleach is intresting enough but indeed overdone. Ichigo Kurosaki is a highschool boy that can talk to spirts (known as plus). He then discovers Rukia Kuchiki, a soul reaper stationed in the world of the living. When a hollow attacks Ichigo's family Rukia transfers her power to Ichigo and he becomes a substitute soul reaper. From then on Ichigo evolves throughout the course of the series and becomes stronger and facing powerfull opponents. The anime is enjoyable for the most part. There are characters with different personalities and different powers. From soul reapers to quincies, human to hollows, there are lots of factions and species in Bleach that are intresting and fun to see in action. The battles in the show of course can be good when they are DONE RIGHT. Early on in the series I felt that most of the battles were well done. They were simple yet awesome, and quick to the point. However, when the series progressed, the fights started to get boring and repetitive. Ichigo would challenge his opponent, get his ass kicked, use his bankai, get his ass kicked a little more, and then he would somehow find a cheap, unreasonable way to win. Other times when two characters are about to battle, instead of drawing their weapons and murdering each other, they would stand and talk shit to each other for ever and ever. I think this is one of the worst downfalls of both the anime and manga and is something that Kubo should of fixed a long time ago. Nobody wants to see two powerfull warriors talk smack for hours on end, we want to see an epic fight! Anyway, some fights in Bleach are really fun to watch. Good battles from the series include Ichigo VS Byakuya, Ichigo VS Grimmjow, and my all time favorite imo: Hollow Ichigo vs Ulqiuorra. When fights that don't include Ichigo getting thrown around like a rag doll or excessive smack talking are overplayed, the fights are enjoyable to witness and are good entertainment. Another downfall is that Bleach contains WAY too many characters. You have Ichigo and his human friends, his human allies, the soul reaper captains, vice captains, hollow villians, arrancar, espada, filler villans, and some minor characters. Half of these characters hardly even get featured in the entire show for more than 5 minutes. It's a shame too because some of these minor characters have intresting abilites or personalities, yet we hardly ever (sometimes never) see them. On the flipside, the story of Bleach is good and entertaining for awhile. The substitute arc is a good way to start off the series and see Ichigo adapt to his new life as a soul reaper. The soul society arc is by far the most acclaimed and loved arc in all of Bleach, weather or not you are a Bleach fan or not, the soul society arc is a well loved arc with good story, battles, and a well done plot twist. But hey, that's just what I think. It's nice to see Ichigo evolve over the series, but it would also be nice to see other characters get some power development too. Some characters barely evolve throughout the series or they just get a little buffer to their already useless attacks and abilities. Some characters have really cool powers and stuff, but we can't see them become cooler with more powerfull and creative attacks/powers because the power development in this series is whack. If you want a shonen with a good story and entertaining battles and characters, Bleach is the way to go. Is it overrated and contain annoying flaws? Yes. Does it get worse the longer it goes on? Yes. However, Bleach has some goodness to it with battles that will entertain you and a story that will want you to keep watching. For some though, the story gets stale the longer it goes on. I do recommend you watch the first 63 episodes, since they are a blast imo. If you want to keep going, thats fine. If you want to stop, that's also fine. Overall Bleach does have flaws, but if you can look past them at certain times the series can be a fun, action filled ride that will entertain you if you are up for it.",9,Recommended,"Jan 13, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ea6769cca8,11
"Reviewing Bleach is a hard thing to do, due to its inconsistency. The first 50 episodes contained some of the best storytelling I've ever seen. Interesting characters,astonishing fights, shocking plot twists, awesome soundtracks, and a good animation for the 2006 standards. If I had to rate the first seasons, I'd honestly give it a 10/10. Objectively, it might be just an 8 or a 9, but up to this point, it was the anime I enjoyed the most. After those 50 first episodes, Bleach took a huge dive downwards, airing a complete filler Arc with about 40 episodes. To be fair, it wasn't terrible, but didn't fit in the universe at all. Vampires invading heaven? Yeah, that's just a terrible idea. The character development was non-existent, and knowing that there won't be any consequences for the protagonists going into a fight, it was a pretty boring arc. I'd give it a 4/10, because it wasn't enjoyable at all to me. After that, the series got better, reintroducing the actual story by Tite Kubo. Many new interesting characters were introduced, creating great tensions. The feeling of a war coming up was intense, and created a great atmosphere at first. But as soon as things came down to the final fights, you could see that the plot stood in front of the characters like a huge shield. None of the protagonists faced any danger from the eyes of the viewer. The fights weren't one-sided, but the tension from the first arc ws lost entirely. All the newly introduced characters were kinda shoved away, and semmed like canon fodder. This arc displays the main part of the series with about 150 episodes. To be fiar, these 150 episodes were paced pretty good, unlike in other series. There was always something new per episode, progressing the story. Bleach had many ups and downs during that time, with some great scenes bing followed by complete trash. There als o were many filler arcs around 15 episodes per Arc, which didn't bother me although. They were written in a good style, and fit to the universe. They also weren't attempting to extend the plot, but played in some sort of parallel timeline, which I think was very good. If I had to rate these 200 somewhat episodes, I'd give a 7/10. And then there is the last arc... In my eyes, it's complete trash. Bad character design, too complicated plot which made it pretty boring, and full of excuses and convenient coincidences. The quality of the animation got way better, but that's the only good thing about it. I'd give this arc a 4/10 So, to sum it up. Great beginning, which then got pretty bad pretty fast, with some highlights, which couldn't make the series better as a whole.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 31, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_489cb1a8a1,11
"This show had so much potential in the beginning! Tite Kubo came up with a very interesting look on death. However, Kubo and team did not bring the antagonist into the picture until episode 60. The fillers in the series distract the audience and make them forget what the hell is actually going on in the series. Also, when Ichigo is in a fight he gives out a long speech on justice and peace and blah blah blah, then and goes to fight some guy. Wins. Finally, walks away nearly dead but is magically brought back to life by Orihime. Also, the series keeps going on and on and on. It is so boring now that I decided to give up on the whole thing.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 2, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3d48434749,11
"The perfect shonen DOES exist. We all love bleach. It is a well thought out plot, great character development, and is whole and complete. You will almost never feel like you are bored or that an episode is there for ""fluff"". It has a little bit of everything for everyone. To me this series exemplifies the perfect shonen: it is male-centered, action dense, has great plot and character development, has some dark themes added in , but really overall maintains this sort of innocence theme of bettering yourself for the future. It can be silly at times and serious at others. It ends on a positive note and leaves you feeling that youthful tingly happiness.",10,Recommended,"Nov 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0066544c63,11
"The one of the Big 3 w/c alongside One Piece and Naruto, but thankfully being a big 3 means popular not exactly a great anime, the earlier parts of Bleach were Ohh-kay for me but as the series goes it became poor the characters were completely interesting im sure you will pick a lot of great characters here weahter it is a protagonist or antagonist, but the story is a mess as i have said earlier, it is one of the overrated anime's no doubt about that, Glad to hear the series is nearly at its end. i suggest you that don't even watch it if you know you will get dissapointed on the latter part of the series, but if you just want to try it coz it was popular and it is one of the anime's w/c have a huge fan base, go on. But if you are really a pro on anime or a classic fan you will drop this.

"I started Bleach a few months back, and i was some what into it, in till about the part where Rukia gets captured. I feel from there it started to spiral down hill in till it hit rock bottom. What really killed the show for me was that, when Ichigo goes to save Rukia, i was like, ""Oh! This is totally a love interest ( If you look at some of the other animes i watch you will know i enjoy that)"" But when it gets to the part where Ichigo should be like "" I love you Rukia thats why I fought all these battles to come and save you!"" But know it was "" Its Because I owe you!"" So that killed it for me, because i felt that the hole build up was for nothing, so i basically rage quited the Anime.

Bleach is top 3 shounen manga’s out there now. And it's really popular worldwide so if you haven't watched bleach this is review for you. One thing is that you should watch first 30 episodes and then decide if you want to continue series because if you only watch couple episodes you cannot get the feeling and description that is wanted to send all the viewers. Story: Kurosaki ichigo is high scholar whose life is always the same then one day it all turns around. Pretty good story it could been better without filler episodes. This anime describe well Man who wants to protect peoples from bad guys and always training to become stronger. It's kind of same aspect like Naruto. Story 10/10 Art: Art is typical shounen art and really beautiful the whole world in Bleach is beautifully designed. Some places in anime have a more detailed graphics than other but oh well its good enough to watch I guess. Art 10/10 Sound: Both Openings and endings are really good and they are fresh and not so dark kinds of openings. And the music is been signed by the Most popular Japanese bands out there. I just use 3 examples of these bands: - Aqua Timez - They are commonly making Bleach themes and always making me happy with their songs. - UverWorld - These one make cool sounds too in series. - SID Makes couple of openings. Also soundtracks are awesome they are songs that played in series. Sound: 10/10 Character: There is a lot of characters in these show but they have all a background story to tell in anime and they have own unique abilities and strengths. Most of the characters are so funny that you always laugh when you are seeing them saying something funny. Others are always fighting about something and someone’s are really shy and not talk about there is a lot to choose which is good you can found the character that describes you well. Character: 10/10 Enjoyment: So what are my thoughts hmm well they are really good and bad what I mean with this this series have good and bad downhills. Bad downhills are definitely all the filler episodes. Well not all of them but many. Enjoyment: 9/10¨ Overall: Bleach is wonderful shounen series that keeps the flag in high in well enough in situations. And there is seen efforts to make it better.

Bleach is great anime and one of the most popular. Yes it has its problem but show doesn't to be honest. The story has a good concept and is able to Versatile but does have some bad filler and some good filler as well. The main cast are all great characters and are relate able. Besides having some great villains like the popular Grimmjow who is personal favorite if you couldn't tell by my name. Another great villain is aizen who evil with no equal who opposite to the main the hero Ichgio who is another personal favorite of mine as well.

"Short review of this long popular shounen, this is my favorite anime of all time (probably because I watched it when I was young) but I will try to keep a critical view (impossible lol). The story (as people say) downgrades after the first arc, and it's pretty repetitive at some points (shonen-style level-ups; new villain, more level-ups, etc.) but that's what I like about the show. I am a sucker for shonen after all. Also, it has vibes; good style, music, awesome villains and side characters, and a good mysterious / spirit vibe which creates a somewhat intriguing setting to say the least. The art, for its year, is pretty amazing, a very good-looking anime in my opinion; I would even come to say it looked pretty dang good compared to other anime of its Era. To be honest, I am just biased as I love how the characters look. The sound is what made me like bleach so much, I'm a big fan of music and they just seem to put on the right amount of music, all at the best times depending on the mood of the episode, I remember most of the OSTs by the hearth and have most on my pc and phone. There are a lot of characters introduced, of course, some are useless, annoying (Orihime), and not very well developed, but what can I say, it has 366 episodes and in consequence, A LOT of characters, some of them are gonna annoy you for sure (unfortunately she is part of the main cast lol). Still, I am a sucker for edge lord characters and villains; and I would say the villains in this show are top-notch. I recommend this show to anybody who likes typical shounen anime and mystery, also I need to mention that there are a lot of fillers (which I also enjoyed) but I recommend skipping them if you want full enjoyment of the show, else if you really love bleach, watch the fillers too, I personally think they were interesting. Critically I give this show an 8.5-9/10, but in my heart, (especially because of the OST) I give this show a 10/10.",9,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd9da91b6b,11
"Bleach is an iconic Series that has earned its place in one of the most known and loved titles around the anime community. A series that made use of art and style to bring to life characters and give them value outside of being another villain of the week. The music and sound bring shivers to those that truly enjoy anime when exploring the beginning phases of a new world to learn about. Pros: The series has loveable characters, and can serve as a fairly decent story for most watchers. Early on to the midpoint, the anime has some of its' best story arcs. It's a show that explores some cultural mythology and folklore in a modern japan setting. The use of fighting and abilities through swords and ""spirit"" energy. The anime shines in part due to the extended universe and fillers that arent' really apart of the manga. Movies and arcs would be great for fans. The series stands out with mostly its' style, art, and sound. Cons: The biggest flaw with Bleach would be the sudden anime cancelation that led to a long hiatus. As well as the reality that when the anime return it will have to suffer through the story that started to become flawed due to the rushing of the manga. Along with some lack of exploration into some of the more Major and minor abilities that make up the world of bleach. It leaves a desire left unsatisfied for those interested in such topics.",9,Recommended,"Feb 21, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a70f4481a5,11
"Bleach has been compared to a lot of leading series today particularly with Naruto and One Piece. One of the reasons is the obvious fact that all the three have the same action-packed story. But the most notable reasons, well of course, the three has been the most popular series for many years. So it’s not strange that people are comparing the “Big Three”. But like Naruto and One Piece, Bleach has its own uniqueness and charm. Something that only this series has. There’s a very long review coming…………… About the STORY The story is very well-made and I gonna admit, Mr. Tite Kubo has a very rich imagination to be able to create such wonderful stories with captivating settings. It’s very original in the sense that it is influenced with so much Japanese materials. Not only the Shinigamis are like samurais but there’s also the combination of ancient Japanese period which is the Soul Society and the modern Japanese period which is the Karakura Town. The most interesting is that these two eras meet because of the main protagonist, Ichigo. The fighting scenes are not just one of the bests but in fact the best even among Naruto and One piece. Together with the most amazing and magnificent animation, every fighting scene is genuinely breath-taking, almost like watching a Hollywood movie. Every arc is interesting and so exciting which includes arcs that are not in the original manga story. Not only is the series packed with so much action and adventure but with drama also. I believe that in order for a series to work it should not only focus to one or two genre. It’s that unexplainable work of the author that despite for having so many genres, he manages to balance it, and the end result is one magnificent story. And if I may add, there are lots of series that have a very interesting main plot but after reading and watching the whole thing, you will be unsatisfied, unlike this one. The reason maybe because they didn’t manage to live up with the main storyline and in some point the story just went to a different direction. Not all series with a good plot is worth watching and a great series is not only about the main plot but how the every chapter and storyline goes well with the main plot. Mr. Tite Kubo manages to do that and almost perfect for that matter. After reading and watching his work, I always end up reflecting on it before going to sleep and that’s what having a great experience is in my book. About the CHARACTERS There are a wide range of characters and because the series does not only focuses on Ichigo you will really had to have a favorite. I, for myself, have been in love with the character of Byakuya ever since I first saw him. I believe Byakuya is next to Ichigo in the most favorite characters on this series. He’ll captivate you not only by his drop dead gorgeous looks, mysteriousness, and powerful techniques but you’ll also be captivated by his very sincere and chivalrous personality. I also love Zaraki whom I believe is one of the genuinely one of the most powerful character in the entire Bleach World, because whenever he appears in a crisis when all hopes seem gone, you will feel an assurance that he will save the day. Though not as physically strong as Zaraki, I also think that whenever Kurotsuchi appears it will surely give you an assurance that they will win. He has this mysterious aura of being one of the most powerful among the Captains. And because he is such a genius, he is usually the one who knows what is happening around and what to do about it. It is so great that both them are in the side of Ichigo because if they’re not it would be a disaster. On the other hand, it is funny that even with Chad, Ishida, and Inoue being the main protagonists, they are rarely seen because it is an obvious fact that everyone is more into the Shinigamis. I also love the characters of the very mysterious Urahara and Yorouichi. They would always appear in moments when you think the villains are already winning. Not to mention that they always know everything as in everything that is happening not only in the living world but also in soul society. Almost everyone in the series will excite you whenever they appear because you’ll know it would be an intensifying fight. It’s very fascinating to see whenever they use their Zanpakuto and reveals their own unique powers. You will also have favorites in the lines of villains. Ulquiorra is my number one favorite villain in this series. In fact, he is my number three in my lists of Bleach characters next to Ichigo and Byakuya. His very calm, enigmatic, confident, and very much interesting considering he’s an enemy. He portrays somewhat of a naïve individual with regards to the feelings of human beings that’s why he’s very much interested to Inoue. I really feel so sad that I don’t get to see him after his fight with Ichigo. I also love the weird and complicated but definitely very special relationship of Rukia and Ichigo. Oftentimes it genuinely feels like their relationship is romantic. About KUROSAKI ICHIGO The reason why his character stands out and interesting is the fact that he stands between being a human, a Shinigami, a Vizard, and lately a fullbringer. It’s like he connects the three worlds and that makes him a very effective main character. It feels so amazing that because he is the only one that you really can’t define what his category is among the four beings, he is the only one of his kind in the series and that makes him really the main protagonist. And to add to that, there’s this evil side of him that makes him more and more interesting. Seeing him transformed with his fight with Ulquiorra was fascinating but his fight with Aizen, “SHIT”, was the best fight among all of his fights. Not only he looked so damn cool when he became the Final Getsuga but seeing Aizen so damn worked up was even more wonderful to see. The best feeling after so many years of watching Bleach. Among all action characters not only in this series but in all animes of all time, Ichigo is number one in my lists. His fights are always amazing that sometimes I am holding my breath as to not miss a thing. About the ANIMATION and SOUND I am not a technical type of person and I don’t have much knowledge with types of animation but I strongly believe that the strong point of Bleach is its animation. The animation is so damn good, it’s almost as if watching a Hollywood Animation Film. Every fight comes with intense visual effects and to add, a good sounds on the background. Every transformation is so great to witness that I sometimes wish I can also do that even with my age. Whether protagonist or antagonist, every character is very much well-made. Such beautiful characters accompanied with wonderful landscapes will make you captivated. It feels so surreal to see how the animation matures every year. Watching previous episodes and seeing how the characters and landscapes changed beautifully over the years is so amazing. It’s like watching your child grow up. I think this series has the best animation of all the series of all time. Plus, they can also show their fashion statement whenever they are in the world of the living. It is cool and nice to see all the fashionable characters. And to ass, I don’t know if everyone notices it but for some reason all characters looked gloomy. Unlike others, all the characters in this series looked so serious and sad. Not that it affects the awesomeness of the animation. The sounds in this series are very well used in every episode. They also still use the important soundtracks even after so many years. You had to have a collection of all the soundtracks and listen to it all the time. With that all said, it is no wonder why Bleach has been one of the most popular not only in Japan but internationally as well. Whether it is in manga, anime, game, and movie form, this series is really a hit. I am enjoying it a lot. Every arc is worth to watch.

"Bleach is one of the big three anime (bleach, naruto and one piece) for a reason. If you care a lot about logic, standard fight rules and stuff like that, bleach is not your cup of tea. Like how in many fights ichigo is crushed by the enemy and instead of working with whatever he has and using a strategy to defeat the nemy, he just gets a new transformation out of nowhere (pretty much like dragon ball z). However, the fights are still pretty enjoyable. However, if you forget about all that and just watch the fights that are extremely epic accompanied with great animation, you can have the time of your life. Out of the big three anime, Bleach has a kind of a mature feel to it, you feel like you are watching something much more than your average anime. There isn't much of a power level system in bleach, like how ichigo defeats a certain person in his shikai (first transformation) and that certain person after just a few weeks or so defeats an enemy that crushed ichigo in his bankai (second transformation which is more than 5 times stronger than shikai). Some flaws in logic like this may irritate you if you care about things like that a lot. The soundtrack is pretty good and well timed. The episodes on the other hand are more than fifty percent fillers that at times don't even go with the stor. In bleach, except for the Bount arc, all other fillers just suck. I recommend you skip them. When I rewatched Bleach I skipped the fillers and realized how much better the anime was without all the fillers annoying you for twenty or so episodes per saga. So it all depends on whether you want to watch the fillers for the sake of completing the anime or skip them. Every anime watcher must watch at least one of the big three anime, Bleach won't be such a bad choice since it is shorter and has already ended (the manga is still going on though).",9,Recommended,"May 29, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d3785a22cf,12
"Bleach was an amazing anime. It was unfortunately quite slow to start and there was a lot of character development in a long amount of time that wasn't totally necessary. There are a few filler series in there that do not relate to the manga and are basically never mentioned again which is a shame as the Zanpaktou Rebellion arc was superb and the manifestations should have stayed on to become permanent characters. However the series that are relevant were fantastic for the most part. The story was well put together, there were some lovely twists to the plot and the characters were much better with the voices that they were given, all of which absolutely fits with the characters personalities.Bleach is a fantastic anime and anyone who is just joining the anime community or hasn't seen it yet, it is a great anime which lasts long and can start a journey down a beautiful and awesome path.",9,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8bb99de62c,12
"*SPOILERS AHEAD* I would've given it a 10 but i really didn't like the idea that Ichigo gave up his powers in order to defeat Aizen (When he used the final Getsuga Tenshō) cuz the final Getsuga Tenshō was EXTREMELY overpowered instead he could have simply fought him with his all without the final Getsuga Tenshō, just normal Getsuga Tenshōs would've done fine cuz after all the objective is not to kill him (because it's impossible) the objective was to get him weak enough so Urahara's trap kido would work on him. i mean yeah sure the idea was that Ichigo was fighting a literal god so he must sacrifice something in order to defeat him but then they shouldn't have made Ichigo SO POWERFUL like i mean he could've beaten the head master yamamuto in his dangai form EASILY so maybe if they wanted to make him lose something that important then just make him a teensy bit stronger than Aizen.

"This is my favorite anime since I was 13 years old, I met him when I was starting in this world of anime, Man if you're starting and want a great shounen or like a good anime from the 2000s I highly recommend it, there's its strengths like: Good Characters a very interesting Lore and epic fights but it has its flaws, like the large number of holes and the plot starts to decay a little from the fullbringer arc, but otherwise it's still likeable, it's not terribly bad, it's just problems with a long plot, anime like naruto one piece Dragon ball suffer a lot from this, but otherwise I strongly recommend it! problem with this anime is the fillers that are too much, but consume little of the work but talking more about the few positives of the work, we have great fights and very striking characters.",7,Recommended,"Apr 7, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_324b696848,12
"To be very precise this is a Shonen and that too from the early 2000s. When I was deciding to watch one from the big 3, I chose this why? Because this is relatively shorter than the other two. So if you skip the fillers it is the best out of the three to get your attention and pass your time. Now the reasons to watch this anime:- 1. Bleach in my opinion has one of the best character designs in any animated medium. 2. If you like characters who don't have huge aspirations like becoming the best ninja or pirate not to say that they're bad, you should watch bleach. Ichigo is very interesting in that way. 3. Bleach has one of the best world buildings which is confusing at first but if you pay close attention the story will give you all the answers. To put it simply it's based on different buddhist realms. 4. Really good fights like with every battle shonen. 5. The main character's power transformation is just great. 6. It decisively has the best soundtrack amongst the big 3 which will give you the early 2000s rock nostalgia. 7.It was the anime which inspired many modern dhows like JJK. My only criticism for the anime is almost half of it is filler which takes the overall anime rating down however the adaptation of the story from the manga is dedicatedly done. IF YOU WANNA WATCH IT PLS PUT SHONEN EXPECTATIONS ON IT DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE AOT OR EVEN THE MORE RECENT SHONENS LIKE JJK. IF YOU CAN BE A BIT PATIENT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SHONENS OUT THERE.",7,Recommended,"Jan 1, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bda9569694,12
"Bleach always make me feel happy and warms my heart everytime, there is so many iconic scenes that makes bleach so perfect! the OST is out of this world which adds so many enjoyment while watching the show. the characters design is top tier in most parts, ichigo's relationship with his squad and orihime is awesome, i feel like every character got their own stage at least once.. bleach is iconic in it's own way and its outstanding, also its fun to watch ichigo blowing up some hollows. :) kubo inspired so many people and will keep doing it, amazing adaptation in my opinion",10,Recommended,"Dec 22, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b44e19a593,12
"the big three as you all know bleach , one piece and naruto. Bleach is unique out of these three. Thats coming from a one piece fan you know?. First and foremost, unlike naruto which was full of plot holes, I actually enjoyed watching bleach for its plot. how the story evolved from a regular high school student to being a shinigami. That transformation was more than enough to enjoy it. Although a classic shounen formula, bleach takes it in a different way. For its plot alone I would give it a 8/10. Seeing how the villain(not gonna say who it is) slowly grows into the plot.Thats fantastic. Second the animation, of course it was the golden era of anime not all anime studios have to budget to master it, so bleach at its initial stages was wonky but as it progressed even the characters got better, I just love Kubo draws his women characters especially Rangiku and Orihime and of course who can forget Yoruichi(if u don't like her u must have mental illness).That aside. Animation was its best by the end of the series so the upcoming eps must have stellar animation.hope so. Soundtrack was the bombbbb! And I am in love with the character ost. Some Ops were really amazing, that became my jam. It has this 90's western vibes.The later part of series like Hueco Mundo Arc and even Aizen's OST gave it a Mexican vibe .I absolutely love the variety in Soundtrack.Watch bleach just for the soundtrack. Character wise u will love a lot of dope characters like Kenpachi, Byakuya, Renji, these guys rocked the show. Kubo really overdid the characters so he had to nerf Kenpachi.(Absolutely love him he's a true beast).Giving voice to soul slayers is something out of the ordinary so they did a great job with that. overall if ur new to anime then u will enjoy watching bleach, and if u have watched naruto and then coming to bleach, good news u will enjoy it. As of now out of the big three, One piece still reigns supreme over storytelling, world building and characters variety, but bleach still has dope fight scenes, decent power system,amazing characters, with a dope villain. My only complaint is the number of filler eps, and blatant fall of espada number 1,2,3.if only we got to have a deep understanding of some characters bleach could have been better.",10,Recommended,"Nov 16, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_825515c37b,12
"I loved this anime, all in all. I've liked it every since I was a kid. However, I didn't enjoy the insane amount of fillers. If they would've stuck to the main plot, I would have no complaints as for as plot goes. Many people say that the season went bad after the (I'll say it this way so that it's not a spoiler) big fight, but I disagree. As far as character development goes, continuing the story was a good move. I'm not only here for one set of foes, I'm here for Ichgo and the supporting characters. I gave sound a nine because I didn't enjoy the changes the made in the voicing. I figured most of that couldn't be helped, therefore I only deducted one point. I give it an overall nine simply because of the miner bugs in this seasons. The final episode was the best I could've asked for.

"Welcome to yet another review of mine. This time it will be Bleach, third on my watch list, and my first anime crossing 100 episodes (I will need to re-watch DBZ). Before I begin, let me clear this, there were multiple seasons in the anime, and one more in manga which haven’t aired, but I will rather sum them up to just 4 seasons excluding the frequent fillers. Season 1, Soul Society. Season 2, Battle with Aizen. Season 3, Fullbringer. Season 4, Quincy. Since season 4 is a manga only season, I won’t be referring it. I will also refer all the fillers season as one. Concept: 7.0 The main concept was based on ‘Soul Reapers’ and apart from not being as unique as others we have seen till now, this concept wasn’t even properly laid out in the show. There were numerous contradictions, and much of the idea was based on vague propositions. Firstly, I really never got the idea of Soul Society. The souls here would have families, they would age, and some would even die eventually. Yes, of course, when we watch the show, we hardly care about this facts, but when you give a deeper look, you will find it all too weird. Souls can come to earth whenever they like, which is acceptable, but then they can marry with humans, have kids, and age like all humans do. Seriously? The concept of hollows was fine, with hollows being the evil spirits. But when they consume other hollows, they regain their sense(fine), feelings and emotions(for real?). It was as if you were trying to force the supernatural Soul Reaper thing in an otherwise real world scheme. And the concepts of Fullbrigers, mystical earrings, and quincies were rather forced one too. Nothing blended, and the entire concept were just forced here and there to make sense for the storyline. What I personally felt was something like this: there were three nations, the World, Hueco Mundo and the Soul Society. And people from these nations were at a constant war with each other. Some people from this nations had unique powers and abilities. The story begins with a boy from the ‘World’ nation, who is later revealed to be a hybrid, since his parents were from different nations. The villain happened to be a ‘Soul Society’ citizen who ditched his own country and allied with the ‘Hueco Mundo’ nation. His plans were to be the ruler of all three nations, and to rule the entire world (universal one). And now, only this hybrid guy can stop his evil plans. Makes more sense, right? Storyline: 8.0 The story of this show is a rather simple one. There is no mystery, suspense, or any missing clue type of thing. Everything goes linearly. There was never any big picture of any conspiracy, and no interesting plots were there to be unravelled. Of course, this makes it ideal for casual viewing, as there is nothing to guess. Aside from this, there were certain, or many I would say, plot holes which didn’t have any satisfactory explanations. And if you consider the filler seasons, then it takes a more deeper dip than one can imagine. Aside from content to watch, the fillers had nothing to offer, and their storyline was way too horrible. Characters: 9.9 Bleach had a sheer number of characters, and when one could expect an inverse relation between quantity and quality, each one of the character introduced in Bleach had ample space and time to progress. I really liked this aspect of the show. I have always been a big fan of series with lots of characters, but generally in such series, a lot of detailing of the characters is left out and all of them have no depth to it. Bleach, somehow, managed to overcome this issue. Each character was detailed well enough, and all had some or the other back stories, which not only connected, but were completely acceptable and satisfying. Speaking of the individual characters, Sosuke Aizen, the antagonist, is by far my favourite character, and the best villain I had seen so far. I really liked the way he picked up fights with all the dangerous and powerful characters of Soul Society, with no regrets, hesitation or fear and maintained his cool even when he was being sentenced. That character was just amazing and brilliant, and coolness etched from every action of his. Not to mention those I-Don’t-Give-A-What look he used to give to all those heroes, that used to be so hilarious. Aside from this, we all have been huge fans of characters like Starrk (another cool villain), Shunsui (made my stomach ache with his humour), Gin (seriously, he gave me such intense feels), Ulquiorra (just awesome), Kisuke (that man, deserves all respects), Hollow Ichigo (I loved that maniac) and so much more. I won’t be wrong to conclude that characters really were a strong point of this show. Tragedies: 8.7 Spoilers Alert! No, there were certainly no tragedies, and that made the so much predictable. After watching a few episodes, we simply learn the fact that no matter how hard the fight is, our heroes will always be safe, and that never kept me on my toes. There were many tense moments when we anticipated something bad to happen, but that bad never happened, and eventually we stopped filling those tense moments itself in the first place. Yea! this worked in favour too, (Spoiler!) because by the time we reached the Aizen Saga, we stopped expecting bad things, and all of a sudden we faced the truth of Gin, immediately followed by his death, and that struck my chord so hard, I was left in shock for the next 7 days. Honestly speaking, Gin’s death is the only reason this show gets a 8.7 instead of a 7 in tragedies section, because that one was not at all obvious, or at least it had never been to me. I got so accustomed to the merry-go endings of events, that I had stopped being sceptical of characters and the moment Gin’s truth was revealed, I was completely shocked. But there was a reassuring in my head, that, now, since Gin is a good guy, he won’t die, and at that very moment he gets stabbed, and I was like, no that can’t be, that’s impossible, he shouldn’t be killed. After that, I remember myself surfing on the internet for a whole week, trying to find hopes for Gin’s survival. His death was definitely the most epic death of all times (clashing with FMA Hughes) in anime, and it became more memorable because of its unexpectancy. Even today, thinking about Gin makes me very depressed and sad. But other than that, there were not much tragedies, although this one was more than enough. I would also like to add, that, from what I have heard, Season 4, which is manga only as of now, have all the major tragedies necessary for the story, yet missing from the three seasons. But since it isn’t on anime yet, I can’t factor it yet. Pace: 7.0 Utterly and butterly poor, and lacklustre. Out of 22 minutes of running time of a single episode, 5 minutes were wasted on soundtrack and specials, and 10 minutes were wasted on either recaps, or re runs of last episodes, In simpler words, each episode offered only 7 ~ 10 minutes of new content. What could have been covered in 1 episodes is essentially stretched over 5 different episodes. And what to say about the filler? Not were they only horrible, but they slowed the show so much, that its no wonder this series ratings dropped so quickly and dramatically. The fillers were the nail in the coffin for this show. And they completely ruined it. Soundtrack: 10 Fantastic. And truly memorable. Firstly, the opening (and few ending) themes were so good to watch and listen, that it gave this show an another edge. I remember how excited I used to be whenever I saw a new opening, and the visuals were so cool (especially because we were so much connected with all the characters), that I often found myself not blinking at all so that I don’t miss out a single scene. And the original sound track, it was not only just awesome, it was fantastic, and even today, when you hear it, you feel so nostalgic. ‘Soundscape to ardor’, ‘Clavar La Espada’, ‘Treacherous’, ‘Escalon’ were among my favourite. In fact the reason I love this show, is because of its insanely strong soundtrack. The moment it played during the show, you will all get so hooked up that you could feel your heart racing in the flow. Be it an emotional scene, or a fighting scene, or a moment of triumph, the sound really captured the essence and delivered so much that you won’t want to miss a single scene or sound. Still today, whenever I am reminiscing, I would generally listen to its soundtrack and I would feel so nostalgic, that eventually I fall depress, for such a beauty build up of sound will no longer be there again (of course that’s not completely true, there are many more anime with great soundtracks). Sometimes, I wonder, that it was the soundtrack that made us feel connected with the characters and the show more rather than the storyline. Whatever be it, this show proves how an awesome soundtrack can help a show. Real Life Values: 8.5 Many people complain that the show didn’t have much of the real life values, and while I agree with them, I would also say that it wasn’t even completely devoid of them. There were trivial values like friendships and sacrifices and there were even complex values like what is true justice. Captain Tozen wanted justice, but he strayed from the true justice he had always envisioned. Often, in real life, it sometimes gets too hard to decide what is just and what is not, and siding with one or the other can lead to highly different outcomes. Content: 9.0 The show had a fair amount of humour, emotions, and action scenes. The show had some pervert jokes as well, but they were all acceptable, or to some extent they were. Speaking of humour, this show wasn’t an all out humour show, so of course you won’t find yourself sitting with your stomach in hand, but of course, there was ample comic relief and casting aside the fillers, it had quality too. Emotions were loaded in as well. In fact the all time pervert Rangiku had a serious emotional turn about during the end of Aizen saga. Orihime, of course, was the trademark for all the emotional content, but I preferred the softer sides of the villains more than anything else. I was sad, the way Ulquiorra died (I was not depressed, because I knew he had to die anyway), because his character really grew throughout his occurrences, and his coldness was a form of emotion as well. Last but not the least, this show had completely awesome and satisfying action and fighting scenes. The battles sometimes took more than 5 episodes to end, but that never bored me. In fact it kept me all tuned up (a little thanks to the soundtrack for that). All in all, the show had enough content to watch, and I never got bored out of it. Animation: 9.0 The earlier episodes have a ‘meh’ animation (technology boundations), but later on the animation turns out to be just fine. The action scenes are amazing. There are like 100 Cero blasts, 250 Getsuga Tenshos and 500 flash steps, but each time they happen, its amazing to watch. All the explosions and cero blasts were friendly to the eyes, without any unnecessary and irritating flashing lights. Speaking about the art, well, all the characters had distinct and excellent art. The villains especially were really cool, they definitely had those ‘evil eyes’, and I was very fond of those. Climax: 8.5 Climax of this show could have been something, only if there were no fillers. When I talk about fillers, I can’t even talk about climax, because whenever it tried to build up, another filler will pour water upon it. That apart, its hard to talk about climax in such shows, because, practically, in each and every fight that happens, a climax builds up. And especially in Bleach, I would say, all the fights that took place had that climax and post-climax thing. The major climax in the plot was of course the battle with Aizen. And just prior to that major event, we are warmed up by several other fights, and the manner they take place one after another, our excitement surmounts in anticipation of the final battle. And our expectations are met as well. The final battle between Ichigo and Aizen was definitely a battle worth watching, and properly justified and quenched the viewers thirst. The post climax was short yet adequate. Especially, the part when Rangiku accepts everything and decides to move on, was a touchy and beautiful thing. I still gave it 8.5, because of the season 4 with the fullbringers, which had climax build up. That season started and ended much before I knew what was happening. That said, it’s no doubt why people sometimes don’t even consider that season a season. Final Score : 8.56 So, for my closing thoughts, I would say, Bleach is definitely an anime worth watching. It’s a fair mix of action, emotion and humour, and with its strong soundtrack and character cast supporting it, you will never get bored out of it. Yes, the fillers can sometimes annoy you, but given the fact that the fillers have absolutely no effect on the major plot line, you can as well as skip them totally in the first place. But of course, if time makes you a big Bleach fan, then watching those fillers isn’t gonna hurt you either. It’s like something more to watch of your favourite anime, that’s all.",8,Recommended,"Feb 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0b19943d0e,12
"I honestly loved watching Bleach, i'll admit now that i only got to watch the English dubbed as i struggle to read sub titles but that said! it was quite the show to watch and Johnny Yong Bosch playing the role of Ichigi for the dub version was a great touch to it all really, he really brought Ichigo's character to life and as i enjoyed the show it got more n more intense for me each time just waiting for the next episodes to release, now that its sadly on a complete hold and no more episodes will be aired its like losing the one thing i looked forward to but still like i said i get to read the manga now for the first time. Overall i'd rate Bleach as being way up there with all the other popular animes and it deserves all the viewers and support all together, its possibly the only anime i can say i truly like with a passion and watching it makes me (laugh, happy, excited, and very involved) in the story and its characters. Hopefully i'll see more from the Bleach series in the future but for now i'll just keep watching the repeats and the movies over and over again until i die because in all honesty! i could never ever get bored of watching it.",10,Recommended,"Feb 7, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6620d91e47,12
"In almost every way, Bleach is almost the polar opposite in terms of a TV show. The animation is sometimes haphazard, and the character designs are nothing special...even verging on ugly at times. The opening theme is very catchy, but the music beyond that isn't memorable. The show at times is painfully slow and follows far too many clichéd conventions of the shonen genre, and some plot holes are achingly obviously. And yet...while this is not a great show by any means, it is a good one, and it's precisely because it has heart. I can't describe any better why I got wrapped up into seeing this tale of a demon hunter, but it has a resonance that 2nd Gig just didn't have. Ichigo is a relatively normal (if morose) teen who started seeing spirits a few years back. Most of the time, it wasn't an issue...just an annoyance, really. But when he and his family are attacked, through a series of circumstances he is granted the power of a soul reaper. Soul reapers, it turns out, are a sort of gatekeeper to the netherworld, and they fulfill a few roles. One of their tasks is to help souls who have, due to personal attachments to this world, stuck around rather than passing over into the ""Soul Society."" Most of the time, these spirits are harmless, and they may wander around for a long time since soul reapers are usually busy with a far worse problem: hollows. Hollows are nasty creatures that like to eat souls, and their bone-white masks often conceal the spirits of those whom they've overtaken to become more powerful. Soul reapers have the thankless task of defeating them and sending them (and their intended victims) over to the ""other side."" So Ichigo now has more problems than he ever thought possible. For one, hollows recognize his incredibly strong spiritual energy and think he'd make a tasty snack, so they show up often. Second is Rukia, the soul reaper from whom he received his powers. When Ichigo gained his powers, Rukia lost most of hers, so for now she's stuck living in his closet, explaining just what the heck is going on to Ichigo and trying to keep him from getting himself killed. Add in two sisters and a wacky dad, a girl with a crush on him and a gaggle of friends who start catching on to his spirit-fighting abilities, a wacko substitute soul that resides in a stuffed tiger, and a guy whose business acts as an arms dealer for soul reapers, and Ichigo's got far more than what he can handle. As I was saying before, Bleach does not have a great deal on which to recommend it, at least on the surface. Quite frankly, what would be the first DVD's worth of material is just plain junk, full of formulaic pap that was so easy to predict that I almost gave up. The opening has Rukia acting as an omniscient narrator, explaining every last strange thing that Ichigo experiences. It's unnecessary, and it lessens the mystery of the moment when this kid gets himself into this strange, fantastical, and scary world. For a while, even past the first few episodes, Bleach seems too interested in defining terms rather than creating a world. There's also the problem that none of the hollows that Ichigo faces are interesting villains. They have their own peccadilloes, but there is no sense that the hollows are anything but self-interested stomachs. They certainly don't work together, and they do not pose that great of a threat as stand-alone baddies. For too much of this first season, hollows exist to fulfill the shonen need to have at least one or two fight scenes every single episode. On top of all this, Ichigo is a rather bland character. Yes, he has parental issues stemming from his mother's death, but what shonen character doesn't have something similar in his past? He doesn't seem to have any interests or character qualities other than being sullen and dismissive, yet that appeals to many of the girls who find him a mystery. In many ways, though, he's a blank slate. I also have to say from a personal perspective that the show's viewpoint on the afterlife is really disturbing and depressing. It is very Japanese, to be certain, but if this show was an accurate picture of what happened after death, I'd prefer just to stay dead, thank you very much. I admit that as a future pastor, it may be something I notice more than others; nevertheless, this show did somehow bother me more than many other supernaturalistic anime. So why can I still give a basic recommendation to Bleach? It's because the show is watchable, for one. It doesn't take itself too seriously and winds up, despite its repetitive nature, being a lot of fun. I found myself coming back morning after morning to catch another episode, and I believe it's due to the strength of the ensemble cast and their support of Ichigo. From obvious girlfriend interest Orihime to Japanese/Mexican gentle giant Chad, the supporting members of Bleach are really what make this show interesting. They are the ones that I really wanted to learn more about, and thankfully that happens. About midway through the first season, we get some episodes that barely involve Ichigo, but for me they really established the larger network of characters. Now that isn't to say that they always handle these characters correctly. For example, the constant jokes about Orihime's large bustline are really out of place, especially considering that she is a sweet, kind character who would probably be embarrassed and burst into tears if anyone made those comments to her face. But again, this is a shonen program meant to appeal to 13-year-old boys, and sometimes that audience wins out. That said, though, I found that almost all the expanded cast did get good moments to shine, and at least a couple of them who appear to be one-dimensional get the chance to improve over time. One thing is certain: not every character is what he or she appears at first glance, and I like that a lot. In fact, it's Bleach's radical turns in its final episodes of the season that made me interested in continuing. The hollows almost fall out of the picture entirely as events surrounding Rukia lead us somewhere entirely different and unexpected, and it leads to a variety of characters stepping up to their destinies. I had no expectations of this from the first half of the season, and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. It's been said that all shonen shows need time to ""get better."" It's almost a cliché in and of itself that long-running epics sometimes take longer to get off the ground, and that's true here. If I were to judge the show off the first several episodes, I wouldn't be sure whether or not I'd skip it. But if you can get through the twenty episode mark that ends season one, my guess is you'll be hooked. I can't say that I'm going to run out and find season two soon; other shows have captured my interest more that I still need to finish. However, I've given recommendations to other shonen shows (like The Prince of Tennis) that aren't nearly as interesting and don't show nearly as much promise. And that, friends, is probably why I think the first season of Bleach is worth watching -- the show is slowgoing at first, but it looks ready to take us all sorts of interesting places in future seasons.",8,Recommended,"May 5, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd53cd65d8,12
"This is like narrating my experience. Manga: I've read the so called Big 3: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and lets include Hitman Reborn and all the the shows included in the Shounen Wave. I love Shounen and if this is valid, I think I have read almost all the mangas that were part of the Shounen Decade (2002-2012) in my country and as much as my knowledge in the manga is concern, Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho has the most amazing fights in manga. My Top 5 Shounen mangas are: Yu Yu Hakusho, Bleach, Hitman Reborn, One Piece and Naruto Anime: I will have to write about the art, sound, character, enjoyment and overall. Art: Kubo was actually listed as one of the best mangaka in the history of Japan manga. He has a perfect and unique style. I am not here to compare so I will isolate this show and see the beauty of art in its own way and give rating. For me it is actually 9, it is the highest I could possibly give because the characters matches the plot and the setting. It has both modern and old setting. Sound: no other anime would beat the coolness of the sound. I always refer manga than anime but I would never thought the sounds will be one of the reasons to keep on watching the anime. Their opening and closing soundtracks are the best. Their background musics are cool, I love the Caribbean style music in almost all of the protagonist-meets-the-antagonist scenes. Character: One of the things that I want from a mangaka is to have a trademark. You know that moment when you see a character and you immediately recognize them because of the character style. About the characters in the story, there's so much unexpected personalities and brilliant characters. There are a lot of surprises. Kubo loves a twist in every character. What I really love is how the flashback tear me into pieces. I don't cry but tell me a deep story behind the reason why behind the rebellion of the antagonist and I'll give you a well overflowing of tears. Their sword/katana's shape will depend on your Spiritual Pressure, they have names and different techniques which will make you curious. Well, my favorite character has not yet released his final katana technique. How interesting! Enjoyment: The show betrayed me. It had blind me for my lust of sword fights. I really love the sound of katana from the moment it's drawn. I rated it as 10 because in my opinion Bleach has the most awesome fights. In every fight, if it is possible not to blink an eye, I would! I enjoyed but you've heard about Bleach's nuisance fillers right? If someone dropped this show, not because of the anime itself but because of those fillers. Overall: I have first read the manga and the moment I started reading I just realized I can't get enough of the story until the day came that I shocked myself because there is nothing left anymore and I'm on the latest release already. I like this show not because it is Bleach, i have been following it since 2009 and it is not clearly as famous as of how it is 2 years ago. The story has a unique plot and similar to ancient stories and or should i say the Greek mythology. i am a fan of Greek mythology and i see the characters as the gods/goddesses of heaven and the main antagonist as the angel who rebelled against everyone because he thinks he's superior than everyone. This show made me feel like I wanted to become a soul reaper someday instead of being scared with soul reapers. Funny as it may seem but you'll understand once you have watched the series. There will be a moment where you will think of ""What if/s"" (e.g. ""What if this is real and we only can't see them because we're just humans?"") The show by the way originally have scythe as their main weapon instead of sword but Kubo is like the guy who does not come up with a conclusion easily like how he changed the series' title for countless times. The best decision he made was to turn scythe into swords or katana. Genius indeed.",8,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a885b66ac7,12
"Bleach - the name itself is fishy but do not worry 'cause the story is not about household duties |Act I| Story [7] Basically what the heck is 'Bleach' about ? Lemme explain it to you shortly. 'Bleach' is all about fighting, reaching new levels of strength and other minor stuff that entertains a shounen (boy). The main protagonist is 'Kurosaki Ichigo', a boy who became a substitute shinigami in order to defend his loved ones. I do not want to spoil the story to you, but i'll tell ya why i've given it a 7. From the very beginning 'Bleach' is very interesting to watch and your organism asks for more. It begins to act like some sort of fuel to you. Why does this happen ? Because 'Bleach' is a damn awesome show at its early stage (~1-60). But after that fillers begin to show up and it makes you feel a bit disappointed. Also the actual plot weakens and if you follow closely then you will notice some plot holes and things that do not make any sense. All in all it is quite good for a long-running anime. |Act II| Art [9] Maybe some of you will disagree but ,man, i like the 4:3 aspect ratio format more than the 16:9 one. I'm thankful that 'Bleach' kept this ratio for about 150 episodes. So back to the point. The art in this show is about excellent. Pierrot did a good job at animating 'Bleach' cause the art is so smooth and few stuff is censored. In terms of art 'Bleach' is great and there are not any issues regarding it. |Act III| Sound [8] Well 'Bleach' has got awesome openings and endings. There aren't any that i disliked, there are only some that i found annoying after a period of time. Also there are several songs in the original soundtrack that i still enjoy, after watching over 300 episodes. You will notice that 'Bleach' has an awesome OST which will get you pumped up whenever it plays during various scenes. |Act IV| Character [9] Naturally, there is a main character and several others that are less 'flashy', but still count as important ones. As i said the main one is 'Kurosaki Ichigo' a boy who wants to protect the one he loves and as we advance we'll see that he tends to defend everyone. There are a lot of characters in 'Bleach' and I can say that they have pretty various personalities, thus it is quite interesting to watch them develop as individuals. |Act V| Enjoyment [9] Sincerely, I've had a lot of fun watching it and i still do. I recall watching it day and night because it was so intense and admirable. Believe me that there aren't people who haven't enjoyed at least an episode of 'Bleach'. There are only people who got bored of it or for whom the show didn't live up to their expectations. Try it and you'll see for yourselves. Concluding, 'Bleach is a nice shounen that you'll want to watch, especially if you are new to the anime culture.",8,Recommended,"May 24, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_01d79c8af1,12
"After reading the Manga and watching the Anime like (may I say LIKE) religion itself, I have oddly mixed feelings about this franchise. The author of this manga (kubo tite) was inspired by Akira Toriyama (creator of Dragon Ball franchise in all entirety). From thereonin, you can understand the plotting, oddities, and lack of death to main/supporting protagonists throughout this story. Unlike other reviewers I refuse to hand out spoilers, but I must say this much about our carrot-topped main dude, Ichigo Kurosaki. Just like many other animes/mangas, the target audience for Bleach seems to be for pre-pubescent adolescent boys at the ripe age group of 11-14. As far as fighting and shounen go, it's all true. Our main carrot-topped ""boy"", ""man"", whatever you must call him learns only to say bankai, put on a mask to further increase his power, and over time has only learned one powerful (i'm more badass than you cuz I can make my blade shoot blackness at ya) skill! If you like shows that showcase different levels of power, almost 30 characters all with silly side stories that never seem to end, and dragonball z-like fights with NO deaths to the good guys (one exception being one of Rukia's squadmates under the 12th division who comes back LATER on in the franchise for reasons unfathomable), then this show is right for you. If you hate Dragonball Z and Naruto, then this particular franchise is the lovechild of the two monstrosities in some old, musty futon used by too many ""Pros"" that you may like. Now, about the actual story. This story involves things like life and death, and this place resembling heaven called the soul society. The theory behind this story is the cycle of life and what would happen to a human soul that experiences and exhibits sorrow, jealousy, or hatred versus those who have none of the aforementioned emotions when they pass on and how Soul Reapers (English Dubbed edition) or Shinigami (death god, or gods) deal with them in two ways. An archaic near-militaristic group called the 13 court protection squads or the Gotei 13 has ruling over the future of the Soul Society guided by Yamamamamamamamamamto Genryuusai ( I said too many mas because it would be easier to have just called the old fart YAMATO). Each squad has a well.. squad and a respective vice captain and captain, each with vastly different personalities and ambitions. Here are the pros and cons with this franchise: PROS: 1 - Character development is interesting for MOST characters and how they get involved with any calamities brought forth by Kubo. 2 - Long story that IF and only IF you're interested in big swords with near-limitless powerups that could keep you compelled. 3 - Even villains have their own complexities explained somewhat well by the author. CONS: 1 - FILLERS, FILLERS, FILLERS. This is put in because the manga progresses too slowly and has tiny-assed weekly issues only spanning 20 pages long or LESS. I'd say that a good half of the entire anime aired so far is FILLER. Who wants filler? I sure don't. My review/enjoyment of this show would be much better if the FILLER didn't exist. 2 - STOP THE 5 episode long fights already! We have seen from time to time Ichigo getting his arse handed to him in 5 minutes and him ""training"" to overcome his adversaries with unsurprisingly ease the second time around with just ONE noticeable skill (that skill being GETSUGA TENSHOU/HEAVEN-SHOCKING LUNAR FANG).. BUT please stop the 5-episode long fights! I beg of you! 3 - This franchise should've ended at least 2 years ago. The mangas themselves seem ""blah"" from time to time especially surrounding the most recent arc involving characters no one gives a rat's ass about (making reference to nearly ALL of these ""arrancar""). I would recommend this anime to anyone under the age of 18 as this seems to be the stuff only teenagers would like. It contains action, blood, mild and childish forms of treason and betrayal, and some love if any lovesick teenage boy likes the minimal levels of inserted fan service (Inoue Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto - both bombshell blondes in the franchise). Overall, I give this anime a 7 out of 10 for all of the reasons mentioned in this review. As previously said, my thoughts/feelings on this franchise is MIXED at best.",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_26b9a6ac60,12
"Overview: If you're an anime fan, or at the very least watch anime regularly, then it's more-or-less a guarantee that at some point you have at least heard of the Big Three, a term used to refer to three beloved shonen anime (""Bleach"", ""One Piece"" and ""Naruto""), called such for their extraordinarily long running times and worldwide popularity. Out of the three, the only one I have seen (and only one I intend to see) is ""Bleach"", which falls into the sub-genre of bangsian fantasy i.e. fantasies that revolve around the afterlife. While it may be far from perfect, ultimately it more than lives up to its reputation as an anime classic. Story & World (8.5/10): For as long as he can remember, 15-year-old Ichigo Kurosaki has been able to see the souls of those who have died, an ability he's not all that fond of but has learned to live with. One day, he encounters a demon that is after the soul of a young girl. Fortunately, said demon is swiftly taken care of by a mysterious girl in a black kimono. Later, he encounters the girl again in his home, and learns that her name is Rukia Kuchiki and that she's a Soul Reaper (or Shinigami, depending on what language you're watching), otherworldly beings tasked with helping souls pass on to the afterlife or Soul Society, as while most souls pass on peacefully after death, there are many that choose to stay in the World of the Living for various reasons, whether it be fear or because there's still something they have to do. Souls that take too long to pass on become one of the demons that Ichigo encountered earlier, known as Hollows, which feed off other souls and even attack humans, with it being a Soul Reaper's job to purify them and allow them to finally pass on. After a disastrous encounter with another Hollow, Rukia ends up giving her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo, which leaves her almost powerless but allows Ichigo to become a Soul Reaper himself. Now stuck in the World of the Living until further notice, Rukia is forced to pose as an ordinary human, wearing an artificial body called a Gigai so that normal people can see her. Rukia then becomes a mentor to Ichigo so he can fill in for her until her powers come back. But to be perfectly honest, I've only scratched the surface when it comes to the story, as things only get more and more elaborate from there. The series starts off with a rather standard ""monster of the week"" format, though ""of the week"" is probably inaccurate given that even early stories tend to be two-parters at the shortest. What's more is that most of the early episodes prove to be important innocuously, with subtle developments that prove to have a pay-off in later episodes, such as certain people Ichigo and Rukia help ultimately developing powers of their own and becoming their allies. What's more is that it doesn't take long for Ichigo's endeavours to develop beyond mere Hollow-hunting, with a major event ultimately pushing him to enter the Soul Society itself, which is where the story really begins, with twists and turns a plentiful and tons of worldbuilding, with us learning more and more about Soul Reapers and their organization (known as the 13 Court Guard Squads), Hollows and another race of supernatural beings known as the Quincies, which are regarded as the opposite of Soul Reapers, on top of multiple other races that I can't say anything about without giving away major spoilers. As I said, the whole thing gets really elaborate, and will probably leave you wanting to keep watching episode after episode in order to see what happens next. However, while the series certainly starts off strongly, there are a number of parts where I felt the momentum was lost. After all, any anime that runs for a total of 366 episodes (which is practically unheard of for modern anime, if not impossible) is basically asking for trouble, and ""Bleach"" runs into that problem because of the fact that nearly a third of its episodes are anime-only. These filler arcs aren't awful per se, but they just can't measure up to the main arcs and feel completely disconnected from the main story, to the point that I wouldn't be able to blame you if you decided to just skip them entirely. Overall, the quality of the series really depends on what arc you're currently watching- when it's bad, it's mediocre and when it's good, it's amazing. Overall, the story did manage to keep me invested despite the incredibly long length of the anime, topping it all off with a very satisfying ending, though I know that it's not the end given that the final arc of the manga is currently in the middle of airing. Art & Animation (9/10): While ""Bleach""'s storytelling may vary a fair amount, the same cannot be said for its visuals. To give you an idea of how fantastic they are, the first season first aired exactly two decades ago this year, and yet it still manages to be as good-looking as some anime that only aired a few years ago, if not better-looking. The character models and environments are are very well-drawn and detailed, there are plenty of great character designs and the animations and special effects are almost consistently excellent and a sight to behold. It doesn't look flawless, with there being a number of shots where characters suddenly look very strange, but that was inevitable for such a long-running series, and these moments are ultimately infrequent enough not to make too much of an impact. Sound & Dialogue (9.5/10): ""Bleach""'s soundtrack was composed by Shiro Sagisu of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" fame, and it shows as the music is just as good as it is in that series, if not more so. Out of the openings, my favourites would be ""DtechnoLIfe"", ""Ichirin no Hana"", ""Velconica"", ""Ranbu no Melody"" and ""Harukaze"", and there are plenty of great tracks that play during the episodes, such as ""On the Precipice of Defeat"", ""Never Meant to Belong"", ""Will of the Heart"", ""Soundscape to Ardor"" and the incredibly iconic ""Number One"". The voice acting is absolutely fantastic- Johnny Yong Bosch and Michelle Ruff deliver amazing performances as Ichigo and Rukia respectively (the very roles that made them the stars they are today) and the dub has an incredible cast in general that includes Stephanie Sheh, Jamieson Price, Derek Stephen Prince, Wendee Lee, Vic Mignogna, Patrick Seitz and many more. Unfortunately, the huge number of characters means that a lot of characters end up having the same voice actor, which is very noticeable in places. Overall, however, the sound design is easily one of the show's many strengths. Characters (10/10): Despite being the protagonist of one of the Big Three, Ichigo's reputation is somewhat divisive in the anime community, with many noting that he lacks any long-term ambitions compared to other shonen heroes and claiming that this makes him less interesting by comparison. Having watched the series myself, however, I feel that this criticism is largely undeserved. Because he HAS ambition; it's just that that doesn't take the form of ""I want to create world peace."" or ""I want to become the strongest Soul Reaper."" or anything grandiose like that. No, what Ichigo wants is the power and strength necessary to protect and help as many people as he possibly can. He mentions in an early episode that he doesn't see himself as someone capable of protecting everyone in the world, and instead he's going to focus on what he can do, making him very grounded and realistic as far as shonen protagonists go. Further separating him from other shonen protagonists is that he's very intelligent and a capable student, ranking in the top 25 in his school as far as academics go as a simple result of studying hard for exams, which he does to mitigate the misconceptions he gets due to his orange hair and tendency to get into fights. In general, Ichigo is an incredibly hard worker, to the point that once he has his mind set on a goal, you can bet your very life that he'll achieve it no matter how many times he has to try (which tends to be quite a few, as he's far from invincible in a fight). As for his actual personality, he's stubborn, short-tempered and sarcastic, but there's never any doubt that he cares a lot for his friends and family. He's protective of his younger sisters especially, even believing that the oldest sibling is born first to protect all the ones that follow. He also has little respect for authority, making it clear to Rukia very early on that he'll protect people and souls because he wants to rather than because it's his duty. Throw in a very compelling backstory and character arc and I most definitely did not mind that he was on-screen for the majority of the show's runtime. But while Ichigo is certainly an amazing character in his own right, it's Rukia who really sold me on the series. She is generally just as sharp-tongued as Ichigo, but also a lot more cool-headed and far more friendly and approachable, though she does tend to play up a cutesy act to get into others' good graces. Generally, when Ichigo and Rukia share a scene together, it's almost a guarantee that they'll be bickering like a brother and sister, and it certainly helps (or doesn't help) that she's barely taller than his actual sisters. Although she loses most of her Soul Reaper powers early on, she's still fully capable of using magic (specifically, a type of magic known as kido) and can put up a defensive fight against Hollows. And when she does get her powers back, well, let's just say that it's well worth the wait, as from there she gets many more opportunities to show off how awesome she can be. Apart from being a badass, she has plenty of adorable moments as well, particularly when it comes to her serious weakness for anything cute, which made me smile and even laugh on multiple occasions. She's also very selfless and always puts the needs of her friends before her own, to the point that Ichigo feels she spends too much time worrying about other people and not enough time worrying about herself, which does prove to be a major problem in one arc, though if anything it makes for some really good character development. In short, Rukia is not only my favourite character in the series, but also one of my favourite animated characters ever. Over the course of the first arc, Ichigo and Rukia gain multiple allies that aid them over the series. Chief among these is Orihime Inoue, Ichigo's childhood friend who lives alone due to the death of her older brother several years before the story began. Personality-wise, she's best described as a pure-hearted goofball with a very overactive imagination, though she's definitely not without her moments of angst and isn't quite as cheerful as her usual demeanour would have you believe. She's also a pacifist by nature, which naturally means she tends to stay out of the fighting, since in this universe powers are fuelled by one's personality and being at peace with one's self. There's also Yasutora ""Chad"" Sado, Ichigo's half-Mexican best friend who's very similar to him in some ways and the complete opposite in others. Like Ichigo, he often gets into fights and so has a reputation as a delinquent, while also being far more intelligent than this implies (academically, he's even better than Ichigo). Unlike Ichigo, however, he rarely talks and is nothing but polite and kind to everyone he meets. In fact, his first real episode has him risking his life to save a boy he only just met (keep in mind that he doesn't even have any powers at this point) and ultimately writing it off as no big deal. He's also very much a badass who packs a mean punch, though he's sadly overshadowed by tons of other characters in the series. Finally, there's Uryu Ishida, Ichigo's first true rival and a Quincy, who as I mentioned above are the opposite of Soul Reapers- while Soul Reapers dress in dark uniforms and wield swords in combat, Quincies dress in light clothes and wield bows and arrows, which they create out of light energy. Initially having a strong hatred for Soul Reapers, Uryu naturally starts off at odds with Ichigo and attempts to prove that he's superior, though he soon mellows out and becomes one of his allies, though he'll still deny that he cares about him to his dying breath. In general, Uryu is definitely the least openly friendly member of the core cast and probably outdoes both Ichigo and Rukia when it comes to sarcasm, though he's also very chivalrous and has a soft spot for women, as well as being very good at sewing. Unfortunately, much like Chad, he proves to be no match for the strongest members of the cast, and so the chances he gets to shine (no pun intended) aren't as frequent as you would probably like. Besides these five, ""Bleach"" features an absolutely massive and diverse cast of characters, to the point that it would take a lifetime for me to go through them all. I can at least say that, as the name suggests, the 13 Court Guard Squads is made up of 13 squads of Soul Reapers, consisting of a captain, a lieutenant and several other members that get a varying degree of focus. Among these are Kenpachi Zaraki, the incredibly badass fight-loving captain of Squad 11 who I found myself loving even more than I do Ichigo, Toshiro Hitsugaya, the young captain of Squad 10 and a child prodigy, who is in some ways a male Rukia, and Renji Abarai, the lieutenant of Squad 6 and an old friend of Rukia's, who is just as hot-headed as Ichigo if not more so. Outside the 13 Court Guard Squads, there's also Kisuke Urahara, an exiled Soul Reaper who serves as a mentor to Ichigo and is probably the most intelligent character in the series, more so even than the main villain, who themself is nothing short of a mastermind. And there are so many other characters that I wish I could talk about, but can't since doing so risks giving away huge spoilers. What I really like about the series is that it generally focuses on developing the characters who matter, and doesn't waste too much time on anyone irrelevant to the story, meaning there's a big chance that someone you like will get their chance to shine. Essentially, if ""Bleach"" is worth watching for any one thing, it's the characters. Enjoyment (9.5/10): Even with the frequent filler arcs breaking up the pacing, ""Bleach"" is a series that is almost never boring, with countless action scenes to keep you invested regardless of whether you're a fan of the story that's currently being told. And where there isn't great action, chances are that there is great comedy instead. Part of what makes the series so brilliant is that its quirky, over-the-top nature means that it can make things funny in otherwise serious moments without ever killing the mood of a scene, ensuring that when things do get dark and angsty, it's never to the point of being overwhelming. Overall: ""Bleach"" is a series that requires a ton of time to get invested in, but if you overcome that significant hurdle then the pay-off is more than worth it. The worldbuilding is vast and extensive, the art and animation is almost consistently excellent, the music and voice acting are top-notch, the characters are incredible and the fights are some of the best I've ever seen. While the pacing can be very sluggish and not all episodes will be worth watching, this is still a series that more than deserves its massive popularity, and I am absolutely looking forward to seeing where the series goes next.

"Bleach is a LONG anime series. As of this moment there are 325 episodes with plenty more to come (I hope. There should be another 10-20 at the very least.). It is very difficult to write a review for this series do the expansive length and many plots combined with sub-plots and an extensive list of characters. (If you don’t want to read all the details skip to the last paragraph for a brief summary.) A good guesstimation is that at least 10%-% of the episodes are fillers. This being said, the filler episodes are completely irrelevant to the series as a whole and are not needed to be watched as there is no inherent benefit in doing so unless, you enjoy the very cheesy and generic humor thrown into these sometimes hastily put together episodes. The transition from regular episodes to filler episodes can also be somewhat abrupt at times leaving you wondering what just happened. Ignoring all the filler episodes, the story line is rather creative and divided into several events that occur in succession. Throughout the several main plots multiple sub-plots come about giving background information and history about many of the characters in the show. The sub-plots sometimes even lead into additional sub-plots. It can be somewhat confusing at times due to the massive amount of plots occurring at once but the complexity gives it a depth that is much deeper than many other series. The characters in Bleach are numerous and it can be hard to keep track of who is part of what group and especially their names. The group of main characters consists of five persons while on the other hand there are roughly 50 or more supporting characters. Character development and progression is relatively profound and meaningful. This specifically stands out as the characters discover new power locked within themselves. Complex relationships are also formed throughout the shows progression as well as old relationships revealed. All of this further helps to fuel the plot of Bleach, adding layer upon layer to an already complex plot. The animation of Bleach is very nicely done with some starkly contrasting art used in the fight scenes and humorous moments to provide an entirely different feel from the rest of the show. The sound as a whole is well conceived and defined; it is often used to help further amplify and highlight specific scenes throughout the series. There can be some significant differences between what is said in the subbed version versus the dubbed version, even though the meaning might be the same, how the words are emphasized can be quite contrasting. The voice acting is well done in both versions regardless of what people say about the dubbed version’s voice acting being “horrible”. (Personally I recommend the subbed version due to the difference in wording, not because of the voice acting.) Bleach is a long yet exciting anime series with a deep, rich plot and extensive character development. Animation, art style, and sound effect/music are key elements used to enhance specific situations throughout the series and are well calculated. Bleach has some magnificent fight scenes, some of the best made in any anime. If your attention span is shorter or do not care for the filler episodes I would suggest skipping them, doing so will not amount to any loss of the plot. I would suggest choosing to watch the subbed version of the series due to wording differences in some cases. Bleach is a solid mainstream anime series that is easy to get into and provides for good entertainment. I would recommend this series to anybody whether they have been watching anime for a long time or just getting into it.",8,Recommended,"Jun 13, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b8cabfe679,12
"Bleach! one of the big 3 shounen manga (along with Naruto and One piece). Bleach deserve its popularity. It has a good plot. The characters are great and has sense of humor but turn to bad ass people when it comes to fight and protect their nakamas. The art is also beautiful and you'll really enjoy watching it. Although fillers are there, you can still burst to laughter and enjoy the fights upon watching it. It's one of the animes you should not miss!",10,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_aa59841144,12
"Bleach started off good but after the Soul Society Arc it quickly turned terrible. It took me a good few episodes to get into Bleach but before I knew it, It was 4am and I had watched over 50 episodes! I thought that Bleach would become one of my Top 10 anime. I was sadly mistaken. Ichigo was awesome at the end of the Soul Society Arc but after that, he became totally powerless after that. There are 4 reasons why it didn't get a lower score. 1) The Soul Society Arc 2) Lirin/Ririn 3) The hollow form of Ichigo when he annihilated Ulquiorra and 4) Visored.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d0a1ad4145,12
"I love it and the characters, but the final season (if it was so important) could have been done SO much better. The ending seemed rushed but overall it gave you that satisfied feeling knowing Ichigo could live happily fighting with his friends and what he did with Ginjo was ridiculously admirable. Good ending but, again, it would have been better if they finished off stronger. Other than that, LOVE Aizen; he was THE villain, dispicable, suave, genious, and cool-headed. I know others hate him for the stuff he's done (and rabid-fangirls love him for his looks) but all-in-all he's a well-though out character. My only shipping-worthy parring for this anime (though their are many) is UlquiHime. They are MADE for each other; a sad ending yes but that is what makes it all the more worth it. fleeting love is better than beating a dead horse over and over again. Great anime, highly recommend it.",9,Recommended,"Jun 22, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_41a58ed029,12
"Bleach is definitely apart of the grand trinity that hit the states when I was growing up (Naruto, One Piece and Bleach). I started watching as a child on adult swim, and my interest in the show dissipated as time went on, I don't believe that is because of the show itself, but because I was too young to really enjoy everything that went on. One of my complaints about the anime is that there are a lot of fillers, I don't believe as many as Naruto & Shippuden, but there are plenty of things that happen in the anime that just don't occur in the manga. I definitely recommend watching the anime BEFORE reading the manga. Another thing is the manga tends to be alot more graphic and less fan fare? There are random spurts of comedic relief, but a lot of people you wish you could have gotten to know better DIE. Also, the only way you could even finish Bleach at this point is if you were to read the manga. In a way I hope that there are more episodes of Bleach, and that the ending of the anime expands on the ending in the manga, but there really is no relief in the end. The anime leaves you at this arc that really feels strange in the way that it feels like it was rushed and tossed at you, but the manga does this at times too especially in the final arc. Overall, I loved Bleach and I appreciate the wisdom it offered, especially in regard to friendship and love. Ideally, I would like to see more from Tite Kubo, I don't think Bleach is over. I think that if you consider the ending of the anime and the manga, it doesn't feel over. I hope that in time after Kubo takes a long rest, he comes back and pushes for more, both for the anime and manga. Some minor advice: SKIP the fillers and watch them at the end. They are really time consuming and while they offer you little details on minor characters, some of those characters don't even truly exist. AT ALL. So just save yourself the time and watch the anime's true storyline first, my best advice is to stray from looking anything up until you read the final arc in the manga. I started where I had left off in the show and immediately got through it in like 24 hours. Good luck!",9,Recommended,"Apr 6, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4386956b35,13
"To be honest, many moments are quite predictable now due to the fact that a part of the script twists have already been overused and something has already become outdated, so of this it may seem childish in places, but they are still well placed and mostly it's not boring to watch (although sometimes it is) - btw the arc with the Soul Society just one of the best ✨. Such a thing is present in many titles of that time (the same One Piece or Naruto), while others do not stand still and move at a frantic pace according to trends and the viewer. If you new to this, then go ahead, it's rel cool. If you are already a fan of the genre, you will guess some twists. However, the ideas and characters are still interesting and fascinating, which proves that the title is unusual and popular for a reason, especially closer to the final arcs, so it is worth watching (I skipped the fillers, but someone might like them, they look pretty💅) A separate like for the sound (a mix of flamenco + sword fights is brilliant🤯)",9,Recommended,"Sep 11, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_17c20bb57a,13

"Bleach is actually worth a try, regardless of the loads of episodes it provides. *Just skip all the useless fillers* Story: The concept is fairly unique. Ichigo gains powers of the soulreapers & has to defend humanity from evil spirits. Sounds easy to follow, but they make it interesting as the story continues on. The fillers are useless and a waste of time. Though they provide some future characters for the ""actual"" episodes that don't actually exist in the manga. I skipped all the fillers and could still follow the story. Art/Sound: Art is Average / Sound is Pretty Good. Some openings/endings are catchy. Character: Ichigo is a short-tempered & impulsive guy. He plays off to be the ""cool"" guy and gets caught up in fights at times. You are bound to like him because he speaks his mind and doesn't give in. Enjoyment: I have to say, most of the episodes end with cliffhangers, and make you want to see what happens next. So, I enjoyed going from ep to ep to see what happens lol.

"While I will admit there are flaws in the show, I still enjoy the show a lot. At first, I really didn't like it a lot, but when I got to the Soul Society arc, I loved it. The other arcs may not be as good as the Soul Society, they were still great as well (I'm glad they still kept going after Soul Society). So let's review all of the aspects of Bleach Story: Bleach's story is quite...weak. Mostly the beginning was hollow slaying, Soul Society was saving Rukia, Hueco Mundo was saving Orihime, and such. Now some arcs (had some decent storytelling in some filler arcs though). But still, compared to most anime with great storytelling (like Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 and Brotherhood, Naruto, Rurouni Kenshin, etc), Bleach is rather poor in this category. 5/10 (Ok, but could've been better) Art: One of my favorite things about Bleach is the art work. It's so gorgeous and beautiful. All you need to do is watch Shunsui vs Starrk, Ichigo vs Byakuya, and Ichigo vs Grimmjow (all 3 fights) and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Bleach does a great job at showing destruction and drawing it's characters. Although there are animation problems in the show, but the good still outweighs the bad 9/10 (Great art work) Sound: 3 categories Music: Amazing. What makes Bleach's music very unique is how it goes from very intense and badass (Storm Center, Power To Strive, and Battle Ignition), creepy and mysterious (Whisper of the Apocolypse, Creeping Shadows, and Torn Apart), funny (Comedical World and Dodo Dance), sad (Soundscape To Ardor, Will Of The Heart, Never Meant To Belong), and also incorporates Spanish themes for the Espada, which is something that's quite unique since most anime shows mostly have English like music 10/10 (Fantastic) Voice Acting: Great. While I will admit the voice acting can sound a bit forced (Ichigo's voice acting mostly) as well as the lines they say, the voice acting is amazing. The dub VAs perfectly go along with their roles (Kariya, Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Hollow Ichigo, Aizen, Dordoni, Kenpachi, Coyote Starrk etc). 9/10 (Great but most voice acting can be quite annoying and corny at times) Sound Effects: Sound effects are pretty solid, my favorite sound effects are mostly the Hollow like/distorted effects when Ichigo is hollowfied and talking) 9/10 (nothing much to say about the sound effects) Characters: This is where Bleach shines greatly at. I really enjoy almost every character in the show. From characters like Ichigo, Renji, Grimmjow, Rukia, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ikkaku, Uryu, Hollow Ichigo, Aizen, and Starrk. And that's only 10, as there are more characters I very much enjoy. I also like how they give depth to so many characters to make them very likable and amazing in their own way, as well as go into their pasts more (and show them doing normal things and have interesting interactions with each other, another thing I like about Bleach's fillers). 9.5/10 (would be a 10 if they gave more depth to Chad and Orihime, but I don't blame Bleach, since they fleshed out a lot of characters.) However, that doesn't mean there aren't flaws to this show. One of the flaws would be the power scaling, especially when it comes to the captains (or mainly Byakuya, Kenpachi, or Hitsugaya), who get powerful without much explanation (especially since they shouldn't get stronger in such a short amount of time as they've trained for centuries, aside from RG training) and hog most of the spotlight . Another thing is sometimes of how things go and like I stated earlier, the plot. They do come off as poor compared to most anime shows. However, like I said, the good outweigh the bad. Overall and Enjoyment: 9/10 Conclusion: Bleach may not be perfect, as it does tend to come off as corny and annoying, but when it comes to well executing the concepts of Soul Reapers and fleshing out the characters, Bleach does not fail to disappoint. Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of shounen",9,Recommended,"Oct 9, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b8a83d060d,13
"It took me quite a while to finish everything of Bleach, but my hasn't been wasted. Story (10) : The base of the story is very interesting and well thought. No wonder it is one of the most famous shonen anime. We have heard/seen/read stories about Shinigali (soul reapers) but not like this one. It is a very long anime, yes, but all apsects are being well developped and thought of. It is a shame though, that how further you go, how more fillers you will get. There are some good fillers, but sometimes you just want to continue with the main arcs. But like the movies (yes, there are 4 movies), you can easily skip them, and it doesn't influence the story at all, and watch the fillers later on. Art (10/8) : At a certain point, the artstyle changes. Probably the anime has been put on hild for a while and then continued again, but with another artist. The first artstyle, is like the one the manga. It is unique and totally fitst the theme of the anime. It is also the typical artstyle for a shonen. The second artstyle is not bad either, but I didn't like it as much as the first one. The scond one is more of a general anime artstyle wth elements of the first one. Don't know if you see what I mean, but just remember, the art changes, it's normal. The first one was better. Warning : expect girls with big boobs. Sound (10) : The soundtracks used in Bleach are very nice. There are many different soundtracks, and even so, often they take the originals and arrange them differently to fit the scene of the anime. The soundtracks don't use always the same genre or instruments so you won't get bored from it. Character (10) : There are maaaaany characters, too many to all remember there names. But the good thing is, is that all characters have been differentiated with several traits; not only their hair, but also their personalities are diverse. Sometimes the characters can be a bit ""surprising"" with what they say or how they act. So you never really get bored of them. Enjoyement (9) : The humor is nice, and is presented in a nice and light way. I'm not always laughing my ass of, but it is enjoyable. After a while you might get bored of those ""typical"" jokes, but they producer manages to alternate it with some more serious scene and then hitting you in the face with a some sudden humour. Some romance, here and there, but it is not major. Also at the end of every episode there is a small original skit, really recommend to NOT skip those!! Overall (9.5) : Great action anime. A lot of battles (ofc), but if you like that kind of things mingled with some comedy and supernatural stuff, I recommend you to go watch Bleach. I know, it's long, but addicting (in my case). Just take your time watching it to fully enjoy it.",9,Recommended,"Feb 15, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_025836bb60,13
"In Bleach it is about student Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see ghosts. One day, his family comes to a severe hardship and he meets the Shinigami Rukia Kushiki, who has won the Soul Society. She tells Ichigo that the evil spirit that just attacks Ichigo's family is a so-called Hollow. Ichigo can no longer wait and storms toward the Hollow to save his family. In the last second, Rukia protects himself so that he can not be eaten. Ichigo then goes to Rukia, where Rukia transfers her Shinigamik forces to Ichigo to protect his family. The anime has a lot of tension and is very well built by the story. Even on good characters is not lacking, on the contrary: I find that even all Fillercharaktere have been well designed!

"Story: 8/10 It's a cliché battle Shounen anime plot, but if you like those type of anime you'll love this. The only bad thing about this anime is the ridiculous amount of filler, I think about half of the anime is filler and the bad part is that the anime makes part of the filler arcs into canon so you're kind of forced to watch them. Although, if you just ignore the trashy filler it'll be a 10/10 so yeah there's that. Art: 9/10 Not much to say good art for the time it was released except maybe the first episodes for some reason they had horrible animation even for the time they were released, but nothing too bad. Sound: 10/10 One of the best anime OST in my opinion gets you pumped up too watch them fight and see Ichigo grow stronger or fall into despair. Character: 10/10 Cliché character development of growing stronger and prevailing through almost unbeatable enemies, but I love that cliché ass stuff so 10/10 for me. Enjoyment: 8/10 Hated the first few eps, but then I got hooked again the filler kinds of ruin, but also again you can just ignore it so yeah.

"This review is based on all the episodes of Bleach that have been released so far (366). A lot of people seem to say that Bleach doesn't have a very in depth story but honestly when you compare where the show is at at episode 300 compared to episode 1 it is one of the furthest developments of a storyline I have ever seen. The main arcs are highly enjoyable and setup the fight scenes brilliantly. The only thing that lets Bleach's storyline down is the fact that this show is so jam-packed with filler episodes. I know you can just skip fillers and what not but I am a bit of a completionist and like to watch a show in it's entirety, so these were a huge slog to get through for me. Even if I wasn't a completionist I would still think it proper to take the fillers into consideration as they are a part of the show's episode list (unfortunately). The art style is brilliant in this show, from the way the characters are designed and drawn, to the action choreography, to how the comedic scenes are delivered, you can hardly fault this show for it's exciting visuals. I absolutely love the audio in this show, they have a variety from heavy beats to more higher-pitched fast tempo tracks. They sound fantastic and the music in this show never fails at getting you pumped to see someone power up or a fight break out. The characters in this show are amazing in their design and are mostly interesting. The only things I can fault regarding the characters is some of their powers are sometimes a little bit dumb (for lack of a better word) and sometimes it simply doesn't make sense how one character who just lost a fight to someone goes and beats someone who just beat the person they lost to originally. The show is a little inconsistent with it's characters power levels. Both of these factors are easily overlooked though as for the most part the characters are brilliant. I love Bleach and while it isn't a perfect anime (due to the reasons I've mentioned) it rarely failed to entertain me and all of the main story arcs and characters were an absolute blast.",8,Recommended,"May 5, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_13e593982f,13

One thing i don't like are the fillers. they have absolutely no meaning in the overall storyline and they never have any effect. I like the idea of the captains and soul society, but i think they make the captains more powerful when they fight against the main characters than the antagonists. They also make it very difgficult to see who will end up with who as far as couples.

"""Losing track of what you want to protect"" That's the feeling you get when you really get into this anime. At first I was hesitant to watch this anime because it didn't look that appealing to me as I'm sure that also applies to some of you who are currently wondering whether or not to give this anime a try. A typical shounen anime?...maybe, maybe not. Bleach has been compared to many anime of the years; Naruto, One Piece, heck even Dragon Ball. The question is why? Is it of that caliber? Is it overrated? These are questions youa re surely questioning in your mind. In my opinion it is slightly overrated. There are episodes where you are on the edge of your seat but also there are those where you would rather take a dump. The main problem is that not each episode is breathtaking. I'm not saying that it has to be all action and stuff. It's just that the suspense is not always there. A boy gains supernatural powers to save a girl then...that's it. The story takes an entirely different turn. Not to say that, that is a bad thing. It's interesting in its own way. For some of you it might be even better than the first arc. Now for the main reason for this animes ""downfall"" is...fillers. This anime consists of 1/3 manga and 2/3 crap. Now I haven't read the manga so analysis could be slightly off but not by much. Bleach has rapidly caught up with its manga which is the main cause for the fillers. Some of them are entertaining, others are plain miserable. For the producers to go so far it only shows how popular the manga is. In my opinion the anime is worth the fillers because despite the cons the pros are much better. The boy Kurosaki Ichigo matures both mentally and physically throughout the course of the anime (mainly mentally). His powers grow whilst discovering new ones. He makes new friends as well as foes. Luckily he is not the type who hates violence or hates killing, otherwise I would have dropped this anime years ago. At first the plot is very interesting and engaging but it goes down south after that, due to fillers. Nevertheless it still keeps you entertained and that is the most important thing. Don't contemplate whether or not this anime is a waste of time because that is definitely not the case. Some will say that this anime is ""shit"" and all that bust they are obviously exaggerating. Those are people who either didn't bother to watch the first few episodes or didn't like the anime from the start. Trust me! No one will say horrible things about this anime if they even remotely enjoy it from the start. Others are wondering how much longer will this anime go for. My guess is until the manga ends...You just went OMG didn't you. Yes this anime will still go on for at least another few years since the manga isn't close to finishing...I think. There is a certain amount of violence and blood but not to the extent where you would label this anime gore (bloodshed). People fending for their life with swords. That's the gist. Story wise, it isn't great but it isn't bad either. You would enjoy this if you like action, whether or not you enjoy the story. There is no strong romance only minor hints so I wouldn't recommend it those who are looking for a dramatic anime. There has been much speculation about couples emerging due to how much time they spend together. They so far, are just rumors so again don't expect anything special to happen. The funny thing is each character that is introduced, it is hard to forget them. They are so unique that they always stay with you. That's how it is for me at least. Maybe it's the art. The style is appealing and it improves as it progresses. That's what I really enjoy. Watching the art/drawing improve over the years. It makes my feel like I'm a part of it. Overall you should definitely at least give this anime a try. Don't say no before you give it a go. That's what I did and look where I a, now, 333 episodes and still going. Even if you end up not liking it you will not regret watching it. My life, my review, my conclusion. Live your life to the fullest by taking any opportunity you can.

"Ah Bleach , one of the big three animes that people are sure to know of or get exposed to . I felt that I had to write this review as Bleach was the first anime that got me watching other anime ( silly me ) . Okay , now for the review itself . This anime , has it's pros and cons . The anime started off with an interesting plot and this made me watch one season per day that was until the bount arc which was so dull , it killed me off and made me seriously reconsider dropping the series . But over time , the plot was like a roller coaster ride , going up and reaching its peak at Aizen's arc and then deteriorating after . As for the art , the anime started off with mediocre or even , bad art style but as it progresses on , it gets better and better so it's not much of a problem . The sound , however , is great ( an understatement ) as they have awesome soundtracks when an enemy is faced , a hollow appears and so on , not forgetting the theme songs which are sure to leave an impact to the audience . The character development is bad as there are just way too many characters and not only that , the anime focuses mostly on the main characters ( Ichigo , Inoue , Chad , Ishida , Rukia ) . This neglects the other characters ( Captains , Vice-Captains , etc ) . One example is when Ulqiourra dies , I didn't even know how to feel as Ulqiourra barely had any screen time and then bam , he's dead . I did enjoy watching this anime initially but as it progresses , it started to get repetitive and when I was at the final arc , I was thinking when will it end which never occurred to me when I was watching it before . But this is covered up by the awesome fight scenes backed up by the beastly background music . Overall , this anime deserves a 6 as it starts to be repetitive and lack character development but since it started off with a bang and has great soundtrack , I decided to give it a 6 .",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 13, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e8723a41fa,13
"I have been associated with bleach for over a decade now and have witnessed its fall over the time. Like many bleach fans I tried to defend it for the longest time but I think it's time to be honest. Bleach came with a wave of freshness, a youth driven shounen with beautiful artwork and refreshing style. This can be witnessed up to soul society arc. If I had to rate only up to SS arc, I would give it a solid 9. But the problem begins afterwards. Story: The most unoriginal story you can ever find in a shounen. I can understand why bleach became a hit in SS arc, but I don't understand why anyone would like it afterwards. The story literally repeats itself in HM arc right down to the gags. It is so blatant that for the longest time people kept searching for any symbolism in repeating the same story like some kind of parallel opposite, but there is none. It is just a really bad story telling. At least in SS arc Rukia was taken away by force for reasons beyond her control. HM arc is so stupid because instead of asking for help, Orihime basically walks into enemy's palms by herself and not only that she acts surprised when these guys come to save her. I kid you not. The girl is that stupid, and it doesn't help she is one of the main characters with so much focus given to her considering she is practically useless and impossible to bear. Kubo's obsession with this poorly developed Character and a really bad characterization of female over all has been one of the major sore points about bleach. I don't see how any anime can recover from the stupidity of practically repeating same story it already told for years so bleach never really does get better after SS arc. It's pointless fight after fight which are so boring because people stand around explaining their powers while the enemy just listens. Wtf? I recommend watch it till SS arc then drop it. If you're interested in HM arc just look for episodes where there is Grimmjow vs Ichigo and Ulquiorra vs Ichigo specifically, these are the only two fights worth even noting. The ultimate boss battle was hyped so much but fell flat on its face, it wasn't entertaining at all. They turned Aizen into a joke. Be warned, there will be random asspull power ups in every fight. Characters There are some interesting characters like Rukia, Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Unohana, Byakuya, Tatsuki but over all its just so many characters with such littler development it is almost a crime why this anime is even popular. The MC Ichigo kurosaki is the blandest protagonist I have ever come across. He can hardly do anything by himself yet he is so full of himself for no reason. He has no life goals besides going from point a to b due to whatever is happening right now and be swept in random fights. SS arc started with Ichigo's wish to protect Rukia who gave him a new life and powers, and in turn protect his friends as well who went with him to SS. This was fine for one arc but as Ichigo grows in age and physically, he mentally doesn't grow at all. There is no maturity of thought process, no character development nothing. Even till the end of anime he still has no goals besides ""protect friends"", the same friends he very conveniently puts down often whenever it suits him. Protecting friends (which is just 3 people in human world so to say since he has lost touch with everyone else) is something that can be byproduct of achieving your goal, it's not something that can make an interesting narrative for a hero's journey. Among the mains Byakuya and Rukia seem to be the only somewhat loveable characters but they, specially Rukia, have been shafted so bad it's not even worth talking about. After a while the characters also all start to look the same. The arrangers were made to be such huge deals but in the end turned out total sissies. Also the villain, god modding Aizen is the blandest character ever too. He is constantly shown as the super powered ultimate opponent but very little exploration is done into his life, his goals and what drives him. His powers, his past, his childhood, his bonds, family, his motivators..m none of that is revealed. Which just makes him a card board cutout with no personality to be honest. In SS arc he made very solid debut tbh and I thought Kubo will create something amazing out of him, but alas wasted potential. In fact poor character development and wasted potential is the very theme of bleach. Fights Since bleach is so famous for fights, let's talk about them shall we? The fights are utterly lame. They lack logic and come across as stupid most of the times. Like how the enemy just stands there doing nothing while the good guys interact with each other and make a plan. Or how everyone spends half of the episode explaining all of their power instead of fighting which is utterly stupid, why would you help your enemy in figuring out your powers? Or like how everyone starts the fight with just smashing their unreleased swords together and keeps going on and on like that when both parties know neither will win unless their unleash their full power. Or like how ex captain class attack final boss without bankai or shikai and get their butt kicked in 0.2 seconds despite knowing enemy strength. Or how the hero can never get anything done at all without a last minute power up which becomes useless by next fight so he needs another power up. Or how no one ever dies in this manga except the bad guys and they get resurrected over and over so the whole concept of death is completely useless in bleach universe. I could go on for days to be honest but I think the other reviews summed up the other points I left. I can't believe there was a time I actually believed bleach will continue to be awesome forever. I tried to keep my hope during HM arc but it never really did get better after SS arc. full bringer arc wasn't even worth talking about because it was just a filler ass pull arc centred around having an excuse to give Ichigo his powers back, which makes all the drama over him losing powers kind of pointless. Final verdict: I would recommend bleach up to soul society arc. After that don't bother if you value your time and intelligence.",3,Not Recommended,"Nov 29, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_75d8d2bc36,13
"I wasn't going to watch this. I mean, I got into anime not long ago and just the sheer number of episodes scared me off of that one. So I ignored it. It wasn't until recently, maybe a month ago, that Bleach got my attention. Ok, then. I'll try this out, and just stop when it gets boring (estimating 50 episodes or so) - were my thoughts. Yeah, right. Finished now, though I did skip all of the fillers while going through the main story-line. When that was finished, I got back to them, but still only Zanpakutou and Invading army arcs have been interesting enough to see through. With this in mind and also the fact that I haven't even seen the manga until after the episode 363, this is my review. So, the Story. I'd say 7/10 because while it kept my interest till the end, sometimes it felt repetitive. When you start watching you can be constantly surprised by this and that, but as the time goes you mostly can guess what's gonna happen. It didn't turn me off, but made me fast forward some of the scenes. The whole concept is probably nothing new, but the fact doesn't make it less enjoyable. Sure you can say that it's cheesy, but it is a fantasy world, isn't it? It wouldn't be right without romantic heroes and evil overlords. Art. 8/10. I don't know anything about whether the animation was good, or how well the action scenes were executed, but I liked it. The character design was a little awkward in the beginning, but it progressed nicely. Sound. That's purely subjective. The Op's and Ed's were not to my taste. The OST was mostly spot on, but there were some moments that made me want to plug my ears. So, IMO 7/10, but it depend's on taste. Characters. That's probably the best part of the anime. It was probably the first series that didn't have even one character that was really irritating. Well, Orihime, almost got that one, but not entirely. She still had her good points and got annoying mostly closer to the end. Ichigo is Mary Sue (or her male counterpart, whatever), but he's still sweet. Not sure what makes him so, but even him always being the one to save the day, doesn't make Mr. Strawberry any less likable. The great part is how step by step we get a glimpse into the world of every character, getting to know and better understand their actions, to see how they become what they are now. And after that see them develop with every step they take. It did get annoying sometimes, because it really is each and every character, but was interesting anyway. Overall? That was great and I already want to start over (probably gonna read the manga to quench that thirst). It is sad that Bleach has ended, but it's also good to know when is the right time to go and not to drag something out just because. I loved the finale - it was lighthearted and bright, with a little sadness. Just what every story needs.",7,Recommended,"Apr 1, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7e651e5ed,13
"Bleach is the perfect name because watching this is bleach to my eyes. It takes the worst anime practices and doesn't make up for them. There's a ton of filler and stare-offs. A sword swing will take ages. Characters will just sit there and stare, saying nothing. Chad is the best character by virtue of shutting his hole while others yap for hours. Nothing was entertaining. The story was a complete snoozefest. The characters vary from lame to passable. The animation is dogshit. There are no cool concepts like a creative power system or setting. It is very telling that the best moment in Bleach, which its fans will never stop talking about, is a villain stopping the protagonist's sword (and theme song) with two fingers. Okay? You realize the author can write anything he wants right? He can write that the villain stops the sword with his eyeball if he wants to. Why do I give a shit about how arbitrarily strong a fictional character is? A friend once tried to re-introduce me to Bleach by showing me an episode from the latest season. The animation and coloring was amazing. However, the same problems from the original Bleach continued onwards. Characters sit there and yap during fights, making 4 sword swings last an entire episode. They talk about important things like how much stronger they are instead of just showing it. If you're not into powerscaling (arguing about which fictional character is arbitrarily stronger), there's no point in watching Bleach.",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2594ce654a,13
"This show reminded me of the TV series _Heroes_, it started off decent, but after Soul Society Arc it went downhill, and the last arc was like Season 4 of _Heroes_. For some generalization of my taste: Gintama>One Piece>Hunter x Hunter>Hit-men Reborn>.................Bleach>Fairy Tail>Naruto. For the story, there was not much of one. Ichigo reluctantly became a Soul Reaper through some special circumstance, but did not have much of a goal. Then it turned into ""save the princes""' for several different arcs. I am not sure what happened to the last arc, but some of the filler arcs are better. The characters, I liked a few of them, but there were too many to actually have a focus on. If there was, it was at the sacrifice of the MC's screen time. Surprisingly enough, the one character that I disliked was the MC himself. Ichigo starts off as a badass, fights, then makes a shocked face at his enemies power, then loses his resolve, Sometimes, he somehow miraculously escapes his enemies clutches, then trains in-between an event. He loses his resolve so many times, I forgot to count, once or twice would have been alright, but then it became annoying. This should not be spoiler, because it is rare for the MC to be killed off, especially early in the series. Ichigo is a zombie, he literally gets killed three or four times, and somehow comes back from the dead each time. Also, other characters that should be on the verge of dead, somehow gain a power-up, and fight like their injuries are non-existent. It happens several times in one fight, this series takes plot armor to the next level. The saddest part of this series is that it had great potential with a lot of characters, but it failed.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 9, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_22d07bf759,13
"Is watching the original Bleach so you can watch the new, much appraised, seasons worth it? That's what I did and here is what you are looking at if you plan on doing the same. Plot: 4/10 As a short summary: Ichingo Kurosaki is thrust in the world of hunting bad ghosts called Hollows and as the story advances evil plots are uncovered and his job becomes saving the world - more or less. The story has a promising start, but the writing direction is plain bad as it's too focused on the action battles. The basic plot is not bad but the story just fizzles along the way. The main problem is that the anime has too many ""important"" characters it wanted to show the power abilities of. And by too many I mean there are at least 20 characters whose fights we have to witness before we learn even the tinies bit of information about someone's backstory, motivations or aspirations. In the second arc, there are around 35 episodes of pure fights before we learn any information about why things are happening the way they are. I understand fights are the staple of shonen but even according to the mid-2000s standards the battles remain under average. It’s a parade of people you barely know duking it out for what feels like an eternity. There’s no choreography, no strategy, no teamwork—just flashy attacks and lots of yelling. Forget clever power combos or strategic thinking. Nope, in Bleach, it's all about brute force. And for some reason, everyone fights one-on-one like it’s an unspoken rule of the Soul Reaper universe. Teamwork? Who needs it when you can shout out the name of your attack and hope for the best, right? At least there is none of that ""power of friendship"" victories. The fact that the power system itself is never fully explained (in the canon episodes at least) just adds to the confusion. Especially since the anime introduces new and unexplained power systems all the time. The last arc makes absolutely no sense, clearly, nothing screams ""solid writing"" like reworking your universe’s rules in the last episodes! And speaking of dragging things out: subplots appear, disappear, and reappear when you’ve almost forgotten they existed. This isn’t so much of a series as it is an obstacle course where the obstacles are your brain cells trying to keep up. These many fights also put a damper on the time given to character development. Characters: 6/10 The main and supporting characters in Bleach start off with solid foundations and interesting dynamics—emotional characters paired with more logical ones, which is fun to watch and there are some unique characters worth watching. But character development moves slowly, and the timeline for when we learn more about them is chaotic. We are left confused by some characters' choices, betrayals or sacrifices because the show didn't explain in a timely manner their inner feelings and history. Even the MC doesn't actually have any tangible and intricate objective or ambition. He just wants to get stronger to protect people. There is no justification about why he would go through so much trouble, no goals, except for ""that's who he is"", which is a bit lacking. If we take another important character, Inoue, supposedly the most powerful healer who could potentially rewrite reality—yet, she spends the entire series being annoyingly useless. Her main role is standing on the sidelines, sobbing dramatically, worsening the situation for everyone and then maybe throwing a shield here or there like a confused Pokemon. It’s almost impressive how she manages to do so little with so much potential. Also, most of the female characters, not all, are often damsels in need of protection. The characters' development is also hindered by one of my biggest pet peeve in anime...comic relief gimmicks. If you think you’ll get a break from the action with some deep, heartfelt conversations—think again. The show insists on inserting ridiculous comic relief into even the most serious moments. A character could be on the brink of an emotional revelation and another one will roll in with a tasteless joke or a physical punch to interrupt it. Then we have the villains, who are more focused on giving long, dramatic monologues and twirling their metaphorical mustaches than actually using their absurdly overpowered abilities to wipe out the heroes. Their development makes no sense either, and by the time they do anything, you’ve already stopped caring. Art 7/10: The design of the characters is impressive especially given the variety of characters. They each have stylish outfits and powers to go with it. The art of the swords and their evolution is creative and beautiful. The animation itself is good considering the period the anime aired. Enjoyment: 4/10 Even if the show drags on and on, I can't say I am completely indifferent by it and it did crack me a smile from time to time. OVERALL: Bleach crumbled under eight of it's own ambition, taking it - and us - all over the place. The early episodes are fun, with an interesting concept and cool designs but it doesn't make up for the lack of emotional development of characters that progress every 50 episodes. Without getting into a review of the new seasons, I think it's worth watching the original Bleach if you are a patient person really into fights. 5/10. I just can't bring myself to give more to the execution of the anime seeing how it is either confusing or boring most of the time. But hey, at least the swords are cool, right?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 20, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4ac7512f9d,13
"Bleach is not a good show and I’m tired of people saying it is. It was so hard to follow just because of how boring it is. Plus over 150 episodes of filler is crazy, I’m glad they stopped making it for over 10 years because it is so bad. The only reason I made it through the whole thing was to say I’ve watched the whole big 3.

"At the beginning for some reason I always put off bleach because most of the ratings said the story wasn't too great. And all the ratings did ZERO justice to just what a masterpiece this anime is. I'd say out of the big three bleach definitely has the potential to be the best. I haven't watched one piece so I can't say much but in comparison to naruto bleach is miles ahead. To begin with the story is just absolutely fantastic. Its at a much faster pace than naruto and the stroy overall has much more dept. Ichigo is actually portrayed as a normal teenager who isn't too happy or outgoing yet he always cares about those he loves and will do anything to save them. The story really picks up from the soul society and just gets better from then on. And for those of you who complain about the fillers, come on guys we live in a time and age where a filler list can literally be used to skip them out. Bleach also has fantastic openings, endings and literally the best osts in comparison to any anime I have watched. It also had amazing art style the characters are super unique and each character has depth. Unlike most shounen anime bleach actually has useful female characters and they are portrayed so well especially rangiku and yoruichi. The fights are also really good and once again I think they're far better than naruto in terms of villains too. Overall I'd say please give it a chance the storyline is the most unpredictable one and it certainly is one of the best. I'd say it's almost as good as fmab story wise.",10,Recommended,"Aug 22, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_654c1b7046,14

"(Spoiler Free) a Action Comedy anime with serious moments in the mix ,remind me of GINTAMA, its a series that starts without any lag imo, huge sets of characters nice music, fights, animation, action. there are lots of things that can nitpicked like illogical power ups or coincidences for plot but since its a long series and i have only watched 63 yet i will enjoy without being a crybaby about it. **The Soul Society arc: (sidenote, yoruichi best girl and ichigoat) in Bleach is an exciting ride with a great story, but it has its quirks. The stakes are high, the fights are cool, and you really get a sense of growth for Ichigo and his friends as well as the new characters introduced However, there are a few things that throw me off a lil bit. First, there's a lot of talking. Every attack seems to come with a mini-lecture, and while it's nice to know the reasoning behind each move, it can get a little much. Instead of keeping up the action, some fights lose momentum with these detailed explanations, which feels repetitive. Plus, the humor doesn't always land. Even in life-or-death moments, characters sometimes goof around or crack jokes, which can feel off when the situation should be intense. Then, there’s the hype around certain fights. Some of the big battles don’t quite live up to expectations, and the power levels aren’t very consistent, especially when comparing Ichigo to the captains or comparing among captains . It’s hard to know just how strong each character actually is, which messes with the excitement. And on top of that, a few scenes where characters could’ve stayed down for real emotional impact end up with easy ""resurrections,"" making sacrifices feel less significant. All that said, it still has an awesome story that draws you into the world and sets up the series for more action. The friendships, the training, and the core plot are strong, making it a worthwhile watch—even if it has a few bumps along the way.",8,Recommended,"Oct 31, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_31d883b302,14

"Bleach. For those of you who have not seen Bleach, go watch it. Now. Or at least read it. (Since the manga is much better than the anime and is still continuing.) I know that for reviews, you shouldn't write a story summary, but I feel I can't write a review without it. Bleach is basically about Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15-year-old boy who can see ghosts. One day, he encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami/soul reaper when his family is being attacked by a lost soul known as a Hollow. In order to protect his family, Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper/shinigami and from then on is pulled into the insane world of the supernatural. I admit that Bleach began rather slow, and some episodes were rather boring...That is until the second season when everything begins to heat up. Bleach has a very great plotline...UNTIL the Fullbring arc. I admit, I do like the FullBring arc, but it seemed more like I was reading a fanfiction when I read it. (I haven't watched it yet.) It was a bit predictable. Good, but Kubo can so better. Unfortunately, the anime ended right when the manga was going to get good again. The art is amazing. When you first start out, you may think the artwork is amateurish, but as Bleach develops, the artwork improves to the point that it's amazing! The sound...Well, the voices are outstanding, both English and Japanese (considering they have amazing VAs such as Vic Mignogna and Keith Silverstein.) but the music gets old after a bit. The characters are well developed and amazing. I understand that a lot of them get a bad wrap but they just hate them so much to the point that they don't realize how developed they are. Even the minor characters, like Yuzu Kurosaki, have such a well personality. The only problems with the series...are the fillers. They can ANNOY the heck out of you. I suggest if your watching a filler episode and it has Don Kanonji in it, skip it. If your watching a filler season, try and stick it out. Some are worth watching. That goes for filler episodes too.

Undoubtedly the most appalling hook I've witnessed, it leaves you hanging with so many questions. It's too hard to explain, you just have to watch it yourself, and if you're not hooked by then, I don't know how you can live without watching this. This anime's an all time classic for me, I always go back to it to relate other anime that take ideas of this, this anime is just so good.

"This is a fun, spontaneous, action-packed anime. that will guarantee to keep you watching. It is one of my favorite animes of all time. Plot (9/10)-- The plot line was pretty amazing; well thought-out and detailed. If you're looking for a good action anime, this is where you should head to. The moments of intensity are interesting enough to where you want to keep on watching, although it may not live up to absolutely everyone's tastes. Everyone has different opinions, but even if you're unsure of it, I recommend you to give it at least a try. Even though Bleach is a very mainstream anime, they did a very good job on it. The only flaw I can find with it is the filler episodes. There are a ton of filler episodes, filling you in on multiple characters' pasts. You won't really miss much if you skip them, the only thing is that you wouldn't know a lot about that character. They do try to make the filler episodes as interesting as possible; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise there's nothing else that's really wrong with it. Art (9/10)-- I actually thought the art was done quite well. All the fights that occurred throughout the anime were very well-shown and depicted. Each fight contains something unique of its own, which was most likely purposely done for the sake of entertainment for the viewers, and to keep you watching. The character art is very nice, although the art of the characters does seem to change a bit as the anime progresses. All characters are drawn in a unique matter, depending on what their personality was meant to be and how they are supposed to come across to the viewers. I am not saying it was above and beyond; just that is was done very well. Sound (8/10)-- Personally, I thought the sound was done exceptionally well. The music inserted during the moments of intensity and during fights seems to fit the plot line close to perfect. Since I have only watched the Japanese version, given that Japanese is my primary language, I found the English voice actors sounded a bit strange. Even so, it doesn't really affect how much one would like the anime. It's just a matter of how they sound and what the viewer prefers. Characters (8/10)-- Each character was done very nicely, although I don't like when they leave some of the major characters out for a while, and you don't see them until many episodes later. This may leave some viewers confused as to where the character went and if they're ever going to come back. This personally left me a bit anxious about what was going to happen. At some points, I was afraid that they just randomly disappeared and would never appear again in the anime. Although that wasn't the case, it was still confusing. I enjoyed the style the characters were drawn in, because it fit their personalities fairly well. Overall, I loved it. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine that's an extreme Bleach fangirl, so I decided to try it out, and now I'm fangirling with her. The anime was great, and I found it to be very entertaining. Again, even if you're unsure about it, I suggest giving it a try.",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_711f6168f4,14

I think that the different arc's were great. The music is really good, it builds up tension at the right moment. Even the opening songs were good especially the first one. This anime has so much action its unbelievable and they fights are always epic.

The histotia and the characters of bleach are unique each different from the other and with its own history and personality, being all well worked and valued in history. one of the strongest points of bleach is that it is a shonen not cliché because the universe created by tite kubo is genius, a human world and the sky that is the society of souls the hollow world that is the world of hollow and having a hell also. -The protagonist different from the other protagonist does not want to be the strongest in the universe, not to be the king of pirates and do not want to be hokage. he did not want anything simply received the power of shinigami and then kept to protect his family, friends and his city. his motivation is only to protect everyone and his personality is shaped through this, he is not a guy who likes to eat a lot and be super nice like most of the protagonist most we can like him although having in the anime characters much cooler as the byakuya and the zaraki for example. the powers he has are not without fundamentals in the manga for example explains why of having each power and having sense and foundation in everything. this anime has a formidable fights beyond its history and the villain of the anime that is in my opinion the most intelligent villain and top of the animes and super charismatic and with a power of sensational manipulation. although the author has lost a bit in the way of his work with bleach, it is still an anime and a manga, with negative and positive points like any other work. -Recomendo watch for your universe created by tite kubo for the seriousness of the story even having humor in the amine, there are deaths in the anime and the manga in their struggles is not that shonen that no one else dies after a while. and also by the characters who are super charismatic and well-worked throughout history. a protagonist with normal ideas and not of superiority or to achieve some type of position or recognition, making him different from the others. -Recommended the anime and the manga.",10,Recommended,"Jan 5, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d8643ca065,14

The biggest difference between this form of anime and the others reviewed so far is the sheer expanse of content. Bleach is 366 episodes long, and that is about average for the format (some are still going and have been for over a decade. One Piece is up to 730 episodes, and Naruto Shippuden is past 450 not including its 220 original series run). That makes the barrier for entry much higher and talking about the series a little more difficult. I will try my best to keep things concise, but this means not nearly getting as in-depth with the characters particularly supporting cast as I usually would like.While I didn't mind watching all of Bleach, I would only recommend a certain set of episodes to a new viewer. If you enjoy action and light hearted shōnen drama, you'll enjoy Bleach. If you start to get bored of it early on though, you might want to simply begin skipping ahead.",9,Recommended,"Feb 2, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d9bab1040f,14
"I'm writing this review after having originally watching NONE of the filler then going back and watching the entire series episode for episode. That said if you really want to get the best possible experience out of this show don't watch the filler and especially don't watch the final cannon arc. After having watched this anime my first time (again skipping all the filler) it became my favorite anime of all time and is still in the top 3. If i hadn't watched the last arc it might even be the first BUT that is IF you don't watch the filler. Sadly that is part of the experience of this show. The filler this show contains makes it almost impossible to watch at times and it becomes hard to just keep going. Nonetheless it is obvious why it is considered by a lot to be part of the big 4 in anime (dragon ball z, Naruto, one piece, and bleach) because of the following it has attracted and the action it contains. All this being said if you watch it my recommended way it is a 9/10 or for viewers who love action maybe even a 10/10. But if you watch the show episode for episode it is easily a 6/10 or 7/10.",10,Recommended,"Jun 4, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3bd3629f05,14
"Ah, yes. One of the famous 'BIG THREE' of anime. When I watched this series, the only others that I had watched previously were, you guessed it, Naruto and DB/DBZ. (One Piece came later for me). At the time, I would have given this show a 9/10, considering unfinished work does not deserve a masterpiece rating. With years gained, I have not only watched hundreds of more series, but have also reached young adulthood. And I believe those two factors are the biggest setback to this series. Simply put, Bleach did not age well. This is probably the case for most people who have watched Bleach back in the day. If you are already in your 20s and have watched plenty of 8+ rated series, you will likely not enjoy Bleach. Some may argue, ""but Cope, this is a shounen, it is not fair for you to rate this outside of the target audience"". False. The other series of the BIG THREE, Naruto and One Piece, aged very well. Hell, One Piece is still aging. I honestly believe Bleach can only be enjoyed by the shounen target audience. The pacing is bizarre and the arcs are... repetitive to say the least. I will admit that the first serious arc (after all the world building and filler) is amazing. If they eliminated the filler and adjusted the story to end after the first arc, I would absolutely dub this series a masterpiece. I will also throw them a bone and say that their OST and OPs/EDs are one of the best and a staple in anime music. I give Bleach an 8/10. If you are a true anime fan, then yes, this is considered a must-watch. Who knows, if Bleach truly does return, maybe it will fit the standards of modern anime.",8,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7b912ce8fb,14
"Bleach - easily the most controversial titan of the Big Three - is an action packed, bittersweet ride of a series. The highs are so uniquely satisfying that even now, many years later, few shows have managed to match Bleach at its peak. Even among Bleach's harshest critics, the Soul Society arc has been cemented in history as one of the all-time greatest arcs in Shonen. From there, opinions are largely split on the remainder of the series. If you're familiar with the branch of Dragon Ball fans that would have preferred if the series had ended after Frieza, then you'll mostly understand this split in the fanbase. Personally, I quite enjoyed every canon saga of the series, though I will admit the brief Fullbring arc that the anime concludes with closes the series with more of a fizzle than a bang - though the final battle is a real treat. Nevertheless, I'd like to expand upon Bleach's strengths and sing its high praises since its easily the most underrated and unjustly panned series among the Big Three. In terms of story, you get a mixed but mostly positive bag with Bleach. If you were able to endure the travesty that was the Fourth 'Great' Shinobi War in Naruto, then even the worst Bleach has to offer shouldn't faze you. The show starts off with roughly a dozen episodes in the vein of a 'monster of the week' Yu Yu Hakusho style mystical adventure. Not unlike Hakusho, the series soon becomes serialized, leading into the renowned Soul Society arc. This masterpiece of an arc contains what I consider to be the best reveal ever to come out of a Shonen battle series and at least a dozen antagonists so well-developed and likable that they became mainstays in the show's cast. If you were a fan of Vegeta and Piccolo, you'll feel right at home here. In terms of its rogues gallery, I consider Bleach to be the Batman of anime. (Though Boku no Hero Academia may snatch this title in the future.) Though the quality of art is largely subjective, most agree that Bleach's art pops more than most of its peers. The general aesthetic and character designs are absolutely superb and distinct. While Naruto and One Piece also share this strength, I have to say that Bleach's designs have always seemed the coolest. Kubo himself would admit that he's more of an artist than a storyteller. Oftentimes the story derives from nothing more than a cool panel he had in mind and practically all of these panels are beautifully realized in the anime. (With the obvious exception of the Thousand Year Blood War, which has yet to be animated at the time of this review.) Coupled with Bleach's art, the soundtrack of the series ties for the show's greatest strength. The legend Shiro Sagisu does his very best work yet here and his score enhances the battle anime in all the right ways. Hype osts, heart wrenching keys, and bewitching tunes can all be found in ample supply throughout the series. The show's general sound effects are also nothing to scoff at. You can't truly appreciate how good the sword clashes sound until you've seen something akin to Berserk (2016), but once you've come to know bad sound effects, those on display in Bleach might as well be music to your ears. Brace yourselves, for this will likely be my most controversial statement yet. Bleach has the best characters of the Big Three by a mile. It was tempting to give the series a 9 or 10 in the character department. If you've been drawn to characters such as Hisoka, Rock Lee, Zoro, and Bakugo from other well known anime, then you will absolutely adore the characters in this colorful classic. While most other series are lucky to have 5 worthwhile characters that remain captivating through the entirety of their series, Bleach excels in this category. Shunsui, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ulquiorra, Aizen, Kisuke, Rukia, and more all remain among my very favorite fictional characters to this very day. However, I'm unable to give the series a 10 in this category - much as I'd like to - due to the fact we're not given a satisfying resolution to a few members of the vast cast. Though it's nowhere near as glaring as in Naruto Shippuden when practically everyone from part 1 was criminally sidelined and left to rot for the remainder of the series, it is still worth noting that not all of the great characters in Bleach that you come to love are fully realized. This is particularly true in the anime's case. I'm admittedly very biased when it comes to my love for Bleach, but don't take that to mean that the series is anything less than very enjoyable. If you're able to trudge through the horrendous pacing of One Piece's anime - don't misunderstand me, the manga is phenomenal - and Naruto's constant stumbles, then you will certainly be able to forgive Bleach its faults and enjoy the ride as you have with the other members of the Big Three. Whether or not it will be your personal favorite of the trio isn't for me to say, but I can confidently say that if you give it a chance, you're in for a comparatively pleasant experience. Bleach more than earns its place in the prolific Three.",8,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_26296d47c8,14
"If you love good old shounen fights, then Bleach is for you. I'm watching this after 17 years and was quite impressed with how well the story turned out even though I find it harder to get into older looking anime. This anime cemented the fact that I still love shounen. I loved the Gotei 13 with Ichigo and their journey together. The chemistry between him and Rukia is great. It's the most enjoyable part of the series for me. The Gotei 13 were well written and have a lot of depth and personality to them. Some characters never develop as much as I would have liked. Not every character was intended to be developed from my understanding. Sometimes plot armor can get in the way. That didn't bother me, but I can see how it would bother others. From the filler arcs, I can recommend the Zanpakuto rebellion and the Captain Amagai arcs. The Regai arc was mediocre. The bount arc was awful. Well done to Kubo and the team.

"As a newcomer to anime bleach almost had a reputation of being the weakest of the big 3 and not worth anyone's time, if you are on the fence about watching this series then I must stress at the very least giving it a try. This is really the first shounen I'd watched, as I tried and failed to get into Naruto, One Piece, HxH etc... but regardless I had some serious enjoyment in watching this series. At the time of writing this review I am at the start of the arrancar arc, and already it is noticeably better than the filler bount arc before it. After mulling over the soul society arc for a while I realised that it was probably up there with some of the greatest media I had ever consumed. The first couple of arcs establish a precedent for the world, the powers that exist in it and why, but there is always a sense of mystery prevalent that only amplifies when the SS arc begins. Right from when they enter the seireitei answers become available to the viewer, but even more questions arise, Kubo really displays absolutely masterful writing and storytelling. The moment the first fight begins the story only builds with intensity and pure ferocity, each fight connects to the last and has wholly unique motive and established reasoning. Even as I'm writing this review I can't believe the utter scenes that had been displayed from start to finish. I found myself actually caring about fight scenes in anime, along with character development and motives, and sweet baby jesus the soundtrack. On the precipice of defeat perfectly sums up bleach in a few distinct noises that build up unbelievable hype in each scene it is used. A thin thread of plot is expertly weaved through the entire arc that connects and makes sense of what is unfolding , and a brilliant twist occurs that is actually meaningful and impacts the series moving forward. New important places and a large cast of well written, interesting characters are also introduced. Somehow every aspect of the arc is balanced well and keeps the entertainment with almost know let up, do yourself a favour and watch Bleach, at the very least up to the soul society arc",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5f67ebc688,15
"Filler filler filler filler filler filler... I don't know how anybody could watch this series while it actually aired. They would start a battle between, who cares and who cares, get halfway through it, skip and episode by adding filler about a soccer game or going to the beach, and then finish it up two weeks later. I would have gone insane if I didn't already have all of the episodes at my disposal. Rather I wouldn't have started the anime in the first place. Story:7 Really I give anything a 7 if I find it moderately entertaining, and the Bleach story was just that. If you sum it up in a couple sentences it really doesn't sound half bad. Regular human boy given the chance to be all that he could be, a story about the strength of heart etc etc. Even goes to 'Heaven' to fight 'Angels' and wins, then sides with them and kicks total arse. The ending was a let down though, once Ichigo had transcended every single character in the anime they mentioned something about the soul king, but never got to it. (Maybe that is why there are movies of Bleach, I don't know I have only finished the television series) But the story gets repetitive if I multiply it by say.... 366. Just between you and me, I skipped much of the filler within the series to get to the parts focusing solely on Ichigo. Ichigo had the most interesting conflict within him the entire series, although it wasn't much it was still a psychological battle and might have been better if it had not been deluded over 366 episodes. At the end when the big titted shinigami is like head over heals for Gin, that was also a tiny tear jerker out of nowhere. Art: 5 I give the art a 5 due to the fact.... the animation was mediocre. Not bad, not good. And during his fights with Grimmjow then continuing throughout the series was the weird live action animation, like the kind you see for terrible hentai games where everything looks like it was made in Microsoft paint. I mean that the colors were very bold and poorly faded. (probably not the actual problem, heck that might have been the animation getting better) Sound: 5 Why a 5 you ask? It's like watching any kind of slasher movie ever made, they use, reuse, then use again the same sound affects. Whenever something would dawn on Ichigo in ANY way ANY time, they would play the same little jingle for about 10 seconds. Character: 6 Overly powerful main character that learns about true friendship *cough* check. I hated how stupid he was. And the only 'smart' main main character was the Quincy. And at times it seemed that he would just pull conclusions out of his arse. Ichigo did get all of his power from himself though... GO TEAM! I give the anime a 7, because it was not quite deserving of an 8. My only draw to this anime was to see how far Ichigo could go, seeing as that Ichigo never died I finished the series. Cool repetitive battles await, and lots and LOTS of filler. Some of the 'arcs' or storylines were completely unneeded, and trivial. More mature than One Piece and Naruto? Possibly, but a once you go Shonen you stay Shonen for 366 episodes.",7,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_acdf2435c8,15
"Bleach is one of the large shounen anime that exist in the anime world, along with the all-too familiar Naruto, One Piece, etc. So, if you've seen any either or of Naruto or One Piece, you probably already have a general idea of Bleach. It's got action, maybe not the best plot, some comedy here and there, a bit of romance, and a lot of stuff thrown together. Now, when I first started watching Bleach, I said to myself ""This is the best show ever"", and it truly was. Back then, when Bleach was pretty much the only anime show I knew existed, I truly believed this series was THE BEST. Just like how some people who started their anime adventure with Naruto or One Piece, these kind of anime draw you in with a new genre and action you haven't necessarily seen before. That's why you see new anime watchers giving Bleach and Naruto huge scores of 10 here and 10 there, throwing around the term ""masterpiece"" everywhere. But as you delve more into Bleach, you start to realize the overused plot idea, the fact that Orihime is a useless girl who pretty much needs to be saved every single time. I respect Ichigo, because if I were brought into the world of Soul Reapers and I had this whinny bitch saying she loves me and going off on her own and getting killed and I had to save her MULTIPLE TIMES, I probably would just stop saving her after the second time. Enemy says ""We have Orihime, we control you now"" I say ""More like, you have Orihime, and I don't give a shit"" But nope. Ichigo will continue to save Orihime because she's proven how useful she is to him. That is... how useful her huge boobs are to Ichigo Anyways, I've made Bleach sound like some retarded show, but it really isn't. I'm not going to say it's your typical shounen anime, because it might be a little better, but for experienced anime watchers, you're probably going to know or what to expect from this show. When I first watched Bleach and thinking that it was the best show in the world, as I continued to watch more and more anime. I realized that there is so much more anime that has everything Bleach has and much more. I'm not going to lie. If you're one of those people who just want a casual anime to watch, or you're new to anime, Bleach is probably a great introduction. But for those of you who are experienced, Bleach is probably not going to satisfy you. There are some great action moments where you get the suspenseful feeling, but there are many more animes that have just that, except they don't have 366 episodes. The art in Bleach is what you would expect, it's nothing special, just a typical shounen anime. Soundtrack is overused, but they have some REALLY good songs for the fight scenes, some in particular which drew me to the series one-handed. The story is overused, standard soul reaper story. You'll understand what I mean if you watch it. There isn't too much character development in Bleach, but it's what you'd expect from a shounen anime mostly focused on enjoyment and action. Overall, I give Bleach an 8, since it is the first anime I saw and I probably enjoyed it more than I would enjoy it if I watched it now. It's not terrible, it has some nice parts to it, but I don't think ALL 366 episodes are worth your time, you can skip through the filler and some unimportant episodes here and there. I guess I'll list out my ratings here: Story: 7 Art: 7 Sound: 9 Character: 6 Enjoyment: 8 Overall: 8 Remember, the button names. It's was the review helpful or not helpful.

"This was my absolute favourite anime before I watched Hunter x Hunter 2011. Everything about it just dragged me in and made me enjoy it. The art style may start off slightly odd (normal for 2006 ish anime), but makes a dramatic improvement by the second arc. The story is well crafted and little details are not missed out. The only problem people may have of this are the fillers, but when I watched it, the fillers were pretty amazing, unlike in Naruto where they were completely unrelated to what was actually happening in the main story. Every single opening is just amazing and I'm torn between which one is my favourite out of the second and first because they're just so great and hits you with that nostalgia and upbeat tune. The characters are pretty decent, some of them can get annoying and stale (Orihime, Chad), there are some there for comedic effect which can get slightly annoying depending on your type of humour (Kon and that other spirit medium guy that's usually there in the fillers). Otherwise, characters like Uryu (mostly in the manga), Ichigo and the soul reaper (shinigami) captains/lieutenants end up going through some development and add a lot to the story, making it much more interesting and entertaining. The vast majority of characters, even antagonists, are likeable and, even though it is centred around Ichigo, there are a lot of times where he ISN'T the main protagonist and other characters do have to undergo changes and problems that they have to solve themselves.",10,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c3923cf9fb,15
"One of the three currently-airing mega-popular animes, Bleach is a lot of things: 1. It has an interesting story behind it, but unfortunately, the anime has been butchered by the amount of fillers in it (the new captain arc and the bount arc) 2. It has a very stereotypical shonen-esque plot to it (in the sense that I WAS DEFEATED BY YOU, SO FIVE MINUTES LATER I'M STRONGER THAN YOU HOORAY!) 3. It has a lot of funny jokes 4. Almost every episode involves a sexual reference 5. It follows the number one rule of shonen animes: if a character is about to die, they must have a long-ass flashback and lots of dramatic music. To keep this review short, so you don't have to see craploads of paragraphs like 90% of the reviewers, this show has the following aspects: - Like most shonen animes, it has 99.9% useless fillers, and a few funny ones worth watching - It has an amazing soudntrack (number one is the trademark song in the series, remade multiple times) - The abilities of the characters are cool, but sometimes repetitive - The quality of the videos improves as the episodes go on Although the author has announced that there is potentially ten more years of content in the manga, the anime has rumoured to be ending after the Aizen arc. I personally am glad. With all due respect to the makers, most of the knowledgeable viewers would rather not suffer from filler syndrome.

"Bleach..... a manga/review that almost any anime fan would know. This would be recommened for 13+ because of the violence, ecchi, and blood in this anime. This anime is a shounen jump series where the anime is an adaption to the manga. This anime was truly amazing, the plot/story was complexed but was complex enough for anybody to understand. So to refresh your mind if you haven't already, bleach is about a normal teenager that had his life changed forever when he can see hollows (creatures that have no heart and feed on people for their misery/ for power) as well as shinigami (people that get rid of hollows. He comes to meet the girl protaganist quite quickly where he takes almost all Rukia (girl protaganist)'s shinigami powers to battle the hollow that destroyed his home and wound his family. From there he became the substitute shinigami in substitude for Rukia. The art was fairly well done, i was really into the graphics, however i didn't like the character drawings. At the very beginning, when Rukia was first seen I thought she was a guy! But when she started talking I was like ""whoa that guy has a girl voice"". But then I realized that she was a girl. Usually girls in anime aren't ""flat chest"" so maybe because of that I didn't realize that she was a girl sooner, and back then I was a total anime newb. Well maybe that was just me, but after I got used to her looks and she's like one of my favorite characters! The sound was acceptable, I wouldn't say it was too good or too bad. I really like the emotions that the voice actors put in when they get emotional or slashed lol. I really have no comment for character except for it's PERFECT! This is what I expected for bleach, characters were so well done, I loved Ichigo's and Rukia's personality the best! Too bad the artist wouldn't put some romance into it, it would have made the anime skyrocket! But it's still good as it is, no doubt about it.

"And 6 years later, I finally finish this anime. I loved Bleach during its run, but like many fans at the time, I felt the anime should've finished with the battle with Aizen. As the Fullbringer arc began, it was just lackluster and I ended up losing interest. The final arc wasn't terrible, but after the big payoff with Aizen, after years of buildup, it was just excessive. But, that can't take away from how awesome this anime was at the time. The two things that shined for me was the great battles and the fantastic cast of characters. Seriously, this anime had so many great characters it probably holds the record for them, from Kenpachi and Urahara, to Yoruichi and Chad. A seriously entertaining cast of characters and seriously intense battles. I still remember the battles between Ichigo and Kenpachi, Byakuya, Grimjow, Aizen and Ulchiora. Of course, like with any long running anime, the filler harms the pacing and overall anime, but the main episodes truly shined. So, I'm giving this an 8 out of 10, due to the filler and the fact that the anime went on too long and should have ended on a high note with Aizen, rather then ending up being canceled.

"I will try to cover up/not tell any spoilers! Read at your own risk(s), if there are any... I remember, Bleach from a long time ago, I was young, maybe in the first grade. Bleach was one of the first, if not the first anime's I have ever watched or seen (Fruits Basket was my first, I think; I was in Kindergarten...). After many years of not watching anime, I finally decided to get back into anime, so this was undoubtedly my first choice onto what to watch (and SAO, but that was an ""OK!"" mistake I guess) Heading into Bleach I didn't know what to expect. Being a part of the (epic voice over )""BIG THREEEEEE"" I knew that I wasn't going to be in for a story and plot worth mentioning, I knew that the development would be lacking, I knew that for this anime alone, I would have to rely on me solely just liking it, because being a part of the big three... we all know fillers will occur. Still, Bleach did surprise me. (OH, AND, Fillers don't count towards anything IMO--so I'm leaving all of those out) Story 6/10 (Well, let's just dive right into it!)

As he is transformed, mystical (you could even say magical), weird, and fate changing events occur. This is the base of the story, and the story arcs will all revolve around soul reapers. Now many say that just watching episodes 1-63 will suffice, and I truly do agree with that, because this is where the show genuinely did shine.(Spoiler) From watching Ichigo being a boring substitute soul reaper, not knowing anything about soul reapers in general, to getting introduced to the other characters, to the episode where he and his family visit his mothers grave, then to him getting owned by the pink guy (DANK MEME BRO), to then getting to know zangetsu, and all the other soul reapers... There was just a taaaaad bit more detail in story here than anywhere else in the series. At this point the story was pretty well thought out, and there weren't many if not zero plot holes. But it's in these first arcs, that make the show how it is ... unstoppable... because how the anime was created and shown, it was supposed to drag out, to keep on going, to become this never ending battle. So, this is where I think story wise, it all goes down hill. Too many sub plots, or rather sub/supporting characters are introduced, and these supporting characters all have their own stories to add on to the show which could be a good thing, but in this case it is a bad thing. Because going into the arrancar arc(s), the story was focused more on battle and the end game, so at this point the, ""life"" aspect is completely neglected, and the use of their school is to not to learn and be normal teens, but to run to the bathroom so they can slay some hollows. Now at this time they sort of want you to transition from school sort of being an objective, to simply just fighting and battling, which is what Bleach didn't need. But that is exactly what Bleach is, simply put, ""Fight."" So having every episode completely focused on battling, and nothing else is quite the norm. Although that just lead to having no interesting story and plot, it was dry and left my mouth bitter needing water. (Spoiler) I'm not saying that Ichigo getting his hollow mask, him learning to control his bankai, and him diving into hueco mundo is a bad story, it was just bland. BUT it was cool to watch, action packed, and had a lot of good sayings in it. Basically, they had an original story, and then stuffed it like a turkey with more story, but then ended up taking out a bit of everything, because if they didn't the turkey would have burst. In this case, we didn't get a juicy succulent turkey, we got a dry over cooked turkey with mushy veggies in it. If you understood that analogy, thank god. Now the overall story (I thought the overall story revolved around Aizen and the Arrancar arcs) had a good plot and I was really hyped up for it. Because during the Hueco Mundo arcs, you learn all about the hollows and their forms. They had some epic fights, and it helped progress the story. At the time I thought the show would have ended at the Aizen arc, but it didn't and I was confused. Turns out there was more... People will hate on the Fullbring arc but I actually enjoyed it. In my honest opinion this is what the show was missing, just life. Sure it wasn't the best arc, because of how it was executed, but that could be said about all arcs. All in all it just let me relax, it let me think of a time when Bleach's story wasn't so jumbled up everywhere, it showed that everyone was living a normal life, but of course (spoiler) Ichigo wouldn't want that because a change of fate occurred. It was by far the most complex, down to earth, annoying, predictable arc ever made, but I liked that. All in all, i give Bleach a 6 in story, simply because the story was cut simple and dry. There simply were no complex problems to bleach that had to be solved, each arc just felt the same to me. Bleach relies more on its characters, battles and those ""WOAW!?"" moments rather than its story, which is a bit saddening, but I still enjoyed the story (up until the aizen arc, I don't wanna count the fullbring arc as the end, simply because it's just not a good ending). Art 8/10 Spanning from 2004-2012 the art progressed and got better. There really isn't much to say here, it was very pleasant to my eyes. Some scenes are questionable (Orihime... put down that leek!) but overall I enjoyed how everything was designed. The openings were pretty good I guess, some better than others for sure, I wasn't really into the endings, except for a few. (The opening with Asian Kung-Fu Generation's After Dark was so amazing) Sound 9/10 By FAR the thing I loved most about Bleach was its soundtrack. There are some pieces of music-ART! On there that I can't ignore, I love listening to OST's from Bleach. Plus their openings and endings, oh my I simply just loved them! The voice acting was pretty spot on, except English Ichigo and Japanese head captain. You might disagree with me on the captain, but I think the English head captain was way more bomb than the Japanese version. And lets face it, Ichigos English version is so troll... Character 6/10 For MAIN characters you have of course Kurosaki Ichigo, Kuchiki Rukia, Ishida Uryuu, Sado Yasutora (AKA CHAD), Inoue Orihime, and although listed as supporting, Abarai Renji. Now there are so many supporting characters, it makes me wanna throw up, but anyways...! Throughout the show these will be the main characters, you'll follow them in their endeavors and see what they're up to. Now I stated this before, I stated that Bleach relies more on the characters than the story or some other points, and I believe that to be true. I just, I just... I just, I'm so disappointed with how it ended. You see everyone ""matures"" which is sort of true I guess, you can see Ichigo thinking more before a battle, rather than just going in, (spoiler) he states that he tries to feel what the enemy is feeling through crossing blades. And this is pretty much true for every character, everyone ""grows"" but its more of a ""lets change for the better, with each other, lets change and become strong enough to do this!"" Which to say the least is very generic, and to be quite (filthy) frank these ""changes"" aren't even noticeable, I had to ask someone to point out to me how they changed through out the series... Maybe I'm just too stupid to understand, who knows. Now there's this thing with people hating on the back story of the arrancars, and I'm not going to lie, I'm almost apart of that hate. But... it's this small character development, that makes up for the story, this bland, predictable story. The backstories are there, not to only give the arrancars more than a name, but to make up for a story lacking in actually being a story. Which is why I'm so happy with how the arrancars developed. Even though the characters weren't executed that well, I'm not really disappointed because I didn't expect many things to get explained in the first place. The battles are truly amazing in Bleach it's what makes Bleach, Bleach, I can't help but watch a few of the battles over, and over again. And no, not because they are flashy, and colorful and big, but because every little detail has a meaning to it. Every zanpakuto has a name and soul, every flashy skill has a name, I mean just everything has a name and meaning behind it. And the battles really do make up for pretty much everything in Bleach. The characters when they battle are amazing, they change when in battle, and then intensify the battle. Honestly I don't think the fights in Bleach get enough praise. Even though I'm disappointed with how alll characters ended up, I'm not angry, nor sad about how many characters there were. In fact I actually liked the abundant amount of characters there were. It made the show seem fuller, and believe me, in a (366 - 201) 165 episode anime, where story and plot are lacking, having characters and battles make up for it is better than nothing. Personal Enjoyment 10/10 Even though it seems as though I must hate Bleach for critiquing it so horribly. Bleach is actually one of my favorite anime's. Not because of characters, or the battles. But for, yes the story (and of course the music). In my eyes, if Bleach was executed better, if it had less time wasters in it, and had a more up beat-slower pace to things, I would've been in love. I wouldn't have put this down, I wouldn't have stopped watching (Ironic, because I didn't anyways)... I thoroughly enjoyed Bleach, because I accepted it for what it is, and it just fits me for what I'm into. There isn't much to say, I just enjoyed Bleach. Overall 7/10 ( maybe 6.5/10) Overall I think I'm being lenient on the overall score. Why? Because Story and Character make up pretty much all of the ""Overall"" score, and personally, Bleach just lacks on both story and characters very heavily. For being 165 episodes long, not having a good story, and not having good characters will literally kill the series... In my eyes, I should have given this a 6, but Bleach did good to cover up its holes in the areas in which it was lacking. Finishing Notes! Bleach is an anime that people love, and an anime that people hate. It's an anime where people have mixed feelings for it, an anime that could be worth your time, or it might just waste your time. I sincerely say this, as genuinely as I can as an anime reviewer and watcher... I really can't recommend this anime to anyone, because in my eyes, it's just not good. Personally, I enjoyed this, you might have also, but for those of you who haven't watched Bleach, I can't say whether or not it's worth your time... That I leave up to you!

"Bleach is an anime in my mind that could have been a lot better, but then again i didn't wright the story. First of all the main story line, once you take out the unneeded fillers, was a good anime. The one thing I hated about this show is that Ichigo is pretty invincible throughout the whole story. First he goes and saves rukia and goes through the soul society an is a top fighter there after not even two full days of training and its all based on determination to save rukia. Then goes to Hueco Mundo and fights an beats coutless Arrancar including Espada. Not to mention he gets orihime back despite what happens to him. *Just for the Record Ulquiorra is a B.A.* Then he Finally fights izan and finds yet another power in order to win.... If Ichigo would have lost more in this series i would have liked it more or done extensive training for big boss battles i could see it being better. Thats my only issue with this story. I do like the variety of characters and different zanpakutos and everyone takes time to be able to use the bankai and master it, unlike ichigo. Hope you guys like just google which episodes are skippable fillers and save you time.",7,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9e35896c46,15
"Ok, I find the big 3 (Naruto,Bleach,One Piece) very overrated, mainly because everybody only talks about these three shows and nothing else. Nevertheless, Bleach as a show is good because it follows it's manga perfectly and the soul society arc is probably one of the best shounen arcs of all time. Ok what are the flaws well it has WAY TO MUCH FILLER, so much they made filler arcs. The beginning of the show can be kind of slow pace at times and sometimes feel as a generic shounen show at times. So over all Bleach is a good anime that everybody should give a try but its not perfect everybody.",7,Recommended,"Dec 17, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6f2e573cb8,15
"Bleach is, and always has been/will be, one of my favorite anime. However, it isn't without its flaws. Story 8/10: The main plotline of Bleach revolves around Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15 year-old boy that is able to see ghosts. Then, he gains power to protect his family/friends/etc. Kind of cliche, right? In the first season or two, yes, the story is a bit cliche. However, the rest of the show (Aside from the horrible, horrible filler arcs), is fairly original. Art 8/10: Also in the beginning seasons of Bleach, the art wasn't what we might expect from a modern-day anime. Slowly, though, it seemed to improve, especially (in my opinion) regarding Rukia's appearance. Sound 10/10: Even though you can expect the opening and ending themes to change every now and then, I believe the animators do a great job in picking out these for the show. The background music, as well, helps to add to the mood of the action, drama, romance, etc. scenes throughout the series. Character 9/10: Some characters in Bleach, mainly in the filler arcs, are not in the manga, and thus can be considered irrelevant, and are usually only used for comic relief. Casting these characters aside, the main protagonists (Rukia & Ichigo) are well-developed. The rest of the character cast seems to be what almost everyone has in their group of friends: A ditzy blonde, the desperate guy, the player, the rebel.. You get the idea. Enjoyment 8/10: As I've mentioned, the fillers in Bleach are 99% of the time are absolutely HORRID. They, I believe, are the worst part of the series as a whole. Once the regular plotlines begin after a long, dreadful line of filler episodes, though, I find this series to be very enjoyable, however I would personally recommend the manga over the anime. Overall, I give Bleach an 8/10. It has its flaws, but it is still a good anime, all things considered.",8,Recommended,"Jun 14, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_047fdcc64a,15
"This is one of those anime that gets talked up a little more than it should. It covers the manga up until the second to last story arc (the manga is currently in the final arc). It is a great story though. It does have great characters, and the action grows to epic proportions towards the end. I will admit that some of my favorite anime fight scenes are in this series, but there are some issues with the story telling. I'll start with the good stuff. Ichigo is a great main character. He is very charismatic, and he cares deeply for his friends and family. He tries to do the right thing and protect innocent people (even strangers). He has an immense amount of spiritual power which makes him a target for hollows (the evil spirits they fight in this series). I like that he becomes a shinigami (like a reaper basically) early on, and it's lightened a lot with good comedy. Friends are made through fighting a lot of the time so there are a lot of rivals that drive each other. There are a lot of colorful characters in this series. If anything, the characters save it from the flawed delivery of the story. There is a lot of mystery in this story which serves as the ""hook"" of the story. Now for a little bad. I found the overall storytelling slowed down to a crawl often times. The story itself wasn't bad, just the way it was told became a problem for me. The concept was so interesting that I wanted to like it more than I actually did. A lot of questions get asked but not answered since Ichigo doesn't care. The amount of unanswered questions really started to bother me after a while. Here's the biggest problem with Bleach. This anime series is a little shy of 50% filler. The problem with that is the main character is the type of hero that grows in strength at a constant accelerated rate. With filler arcs there is no growth (there literally cannot be in order to make sense in the main story). The filler is this anime's greatest downfall, especially because there are a couple of filler arcs that start in the middle of a main arc. They don't even squeeze them in properly. This makes it really hard to skip the filler. The first time through I watched all of the filler, and because I read the manga later I found that it could have been an 8 or 9. I give it a 7 if you skip filler, and it gets the slightly lower mark because if you skip filler you unfortunately miss bits and pieces of the main storyline as well. In short, if you want a story with great action, great characters, good comedy, super powers, and you don't care too much about the story then this is for you. Bleach is a GOOD anime, and it's worth a watch so definitely don't skip it.",7,Recommended,"Jan 25, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_77bda3e779,15

"Im so pissed for giving Bleach a 9, it deserves a freaking 10! So much missed potential... With having literal 45% filler percentage(163/366 eps), it still faired pretty well. Majority of the fillers were nice, but they always seemed to come right before a hyped event, which always makes you frustrated. The second biggest problem for me was the ending. Instead of stopping the show after the end of the Aizen Arc, giving it much bigger emotional weight in regards to Ichigo`s sacrifice, they have decided to do the Fullbringer Arc which was not only boring to watch(honestly it felt like a filler arc) but the ending was meek as well. We havent even seen the full extent of Ichigo`s new powers...Only showed 1 empowered Getsuga Tenshou, nothing special.... At atleast it was nice to see Byakuya finally boldly showing his respect towards Ichigo. And the third biggest problem is the lack of action in the anime. Compared to Naruto and One Piece, it was refreshing to watch a shounen with quick battles lasting only 2-3 eps max. However there werent many quality fights of Hollow Ichigo taking over and showing the full extent of Ichigo`s powers. I wanted to watch more chaos and destruction, not some 3rd rate characters like Chad/Hinamori/Hisagi/Matsumoto/Iba/Oomaeda/Kira/Espada`s Fraccion/Bounto fight. All the Vasto Lorde + Tousen, except Ulquiorra, were a disappointent too. Despite beeing introduced to be stronger than a captain, they were defeated too quickly(especially Harribel !!!). And the last bit is also cutting down on the emotional side. Sure cutting down on fights duration was refreshing but shortening the emotional windows made Bleach kinda shallow at times. We should have had more Zangetsu/Aizen/Gin screen time to make it truly impactful and unforgettable, the already awesome experience of watching Bleach!!! The OST and sound effects were pure 10/10. I will never forget how a Garganta opening looks and sounds like or the sound of a Sonido side-step.

"I can't believe this was an anime I used to enjoy back when I was a kid. I don't even understand why this anime is rated 7 on MAL. It should be 5 or 6 max. Story: The anime was terribly directed. The constant fillers were distracting and were inserted randomly in the middle of important story arcs. Whoever directed this anime needs to be fired. The fight scenes were terribly drawn out with unnecessary dramatic dialogue. There were also so many unnecessary recap episodes. This anime didn't even need that many recap episodes because the first 4-7 minutes of every single freaking episode they have is pretty much a recap of either the last episode or that entire arc. You can literally go run a mile outside and come back and be just in time for the main part of the episode. This anime took 366 episodes to get to the point when it could have done it in half the number of episodes. Actually, Bleach never got to the end because they decided to cancel it because it wasn't doing well. Gee, I wonder why. When you destroy your own anime by inserting a bunch of poorly executed fillers, you're bound to turn away viewers. The comedy was also poorly timed. The jokes in themselves are trite. At first, they were bearable, but after 100 episodes of the same thing, it gets tiresome. The anime just tries way too hard to lighten up all the serious scenes by injecting unnecessary gags and comic relief. Well, needless to say, it didn't work. Rather, I think it had the opposite effect. I felt irritated if anything. Characters: The characters were all irritating too. They always talk too much during the battles. They don't strategize very well. Even the smart characters are terrible at critical thinking. Character development focuses mainly on Ichigo, while everyone is pretty much an extra. The female characters' development were especially horrible. For the entire 300 something show, Rukia and Orihime never grow stronger. They remained useless compared to Ichigo. I get that this show is a shounen, but is it necessary to diminish the female characters' capabilities in order for the main male protagonist to be strong? Can they not grow together emotionally, mentally, and physically? Can men only be strong when women are weak? Would strong female characters make the male characters weak? Completely irritating to see how useless the female characters turned out. Furthermore, Ichigo as a character became way too OP. His weaknesses only show up when he's insecure. Most of the time, he's just a reckless, arrogant dumbass who somehow thinks he can take care of everything. The internal dialogue of the characters did nothing to make them three dimensional. It was really just poor writing and execution. Art: The art was okay. Nothing special. There are anime out there that rival Bleach's art, and there are plenty anime out there that are way better drawn than Bleach. Enjoyment: My enjoyment of the anime was negatively impacted by the poorly executed story and poorly written character development. Rather than something relaxing to watch during my break, I ended up feeling immense frustration at the characters and the story's direction. Overall: Don't waste your time watching this anime. If anything, I would only watch the first 50 episodes or so of the Rukia arc, and take my leave. (But skip the fillers!!!) Otherwise you're just wasting your time.

"WARNING: SPOILERS Bleach was the first anime I picked up after having taken about a 3-4 year break from watching anime. The first season was so good, so intriguing, there was something to be had by watching this. Who are these mysterious blade wielding spirits, and what are they doing here fighting monsters that seemingly nobody can see? Well after the first season you pretty much learn everything you need to know about them. The second season is just the first season with different enemies. The bounts were pretty cool, and they still had potential for the series, however after this there was no justification in watching this anymore. Having invested so much time into the series already I felt I had to stick around for the art if not the story. Everything just repeats itself and it feels so redundant and just a waste of time. Favorite Character(s): Byakuya Kuchiki, Yoruichi Shihouin Byakuya is my favorite purely based on aesthetics, nothing else.

From a great story to compelling characters to amazing fight scenes, it was easy to see why the series became one of top three most popular ongoing manga in the Shonen Jump magazine. However, after that point the story Tite Kubo set up seemed to come crumbling down and Kubo didn't know how to put it back together. Character development is now basically showing their back story instead of any actual development and many plot points that are meant to set up character development never come to fruition and are never addressed again. The Arrancar Arc gets interrupted in the middle by two filler arcs back to back, the filler is so bad that there are almost as many filler episodes as there are canon episodes and it just seems to drag on forever, and honestly I wish it had just stopped there.

"Bleach is an almost perfect embodiment of the shounen genre in my opinion. The story starts out well and you easily get drawn into it. The reason is really the characters, because they are so unique and interesting. The issue I have, and the reason I won't give it a higher rating is the fact that the story often feels fragmented. It is because of the fact that there are sudden moments of escalation followed by long stretches where it all plateaus. Nevertheless they must have done something right for the series to have such a following. The best way I can describe this anime is as a complete package. Although there are some weaknesses and holes present within the story the fact is this series has everything from comedy to tragedy, and straight up action scenes. It's the type of anime that will keep you coming back even though there doesn't seem to be anything spectacular about it. In terms art there really isn't anything special about it at all, but I don't think that is what the viewer should be worried about. The plethora of interesting characters will keep you far too busy for the art to get in the way of enjoying the show. Really this show is for anyone looking for an anime that combines the shounen, super power and supernatural themes into one interesting plot, but isn't serious in terms of its overall mood. //Spoilers(maybe?)// More like a fair warning, but the anime does end relatively suddenly in what seems like the middle of the story. Well that is because it does, the manga is still ongoing, so if you do feel like you wish to continue the story the manga is the way to do it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 19, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_aec1145295,16
"I always wandered about Bleach and why is it so popular, now I see it. The first episode, admit it, kind of boring. And some people give up On whole thing, but don't! It really is amazing gets interesting every second. I spend night nonstop watching episodes, because I liked it so much. And never skipped a episode or dropped it once. Art-9: At fist art was shitty because it was just the begging, fuzzy and not high quality drawings. After a while it got much better, now is very hd. I would give it a 10 if the creator (Tite Kubo) wan't a pervert and draw giant breasts on every female character (not Rukia). Some characters are very interesting (arranacrs, hollows) and some clothes that characters wear are too revealing (Rengiku, Hallbel) Also a lot of male are attractive (Ichigo) Sound-10: I LOVE IT! the opening themes are fantastic! I don't listen to much closing themes. Because of Bleach I find my self in to Japanese music. Plus the sound effects are the best I ever heard. Whenever there is a battle EPIC MUSIC! Something funny happening, the music just adds and makes it more funny! And the best of all are the sad moment soundtracks. Whenever there is something sad happening, the soundtracks lead me to tears. It the best thing about bleach. Most of all when ""number one"" is playing, you know Ichigo is gonna kick ass. It makes me exited. Characters- 8: Could do better. That's the part where it makes me mad about bleach. Ichigo half shinigami and human, gets all this power. He gets stronger and kicks ass until he socks again! After he rescued Rukia, he all super strong and shit. But in the next arc he's all dam weak again.He gets strong, but then he becomes week again! It's like a cycle! It's kind of like, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU ICHIGO! YOU STINK! Too much about the main character, not enough concentration on the others. Ichigo seems like the only one getting stronger! Maybe some characters like Uryu and Rukia are gaining more powers. But still so dam week! In some battles they are so strong and awesome, in others they stink! It's like they got weaker! But I really love most of the characters. Accept Orehime who is constantly crying, so dam useless. And doesn't use her dam power at all! When ichigo is on his way to death all she can do is cry cry cry! The only use of her self she can make his her healing power! However she does encourage Ichigo to keep on fighting for her sake! But gets kidnapped and bullied by opponents stronger then her! Forget Orehime, there are also a lot awesome female characters, like Rukia, Yoruichi, Soi Fon and others. Dubbig-8.5 He dubs were great at first but over time the character voices changed. And to worse! They already changed awesome voice actors for Chad, Urahara and Kenpachi! All of them were awesome, now they sock! But I still love the main voice cast, Ichigo, Rukia. Orehime and such. And I think Johnny Yong Bosh was born to dub Ichigo! He does great job with the bankai, getsuga tenshoue, and ichigo's tone according to the mood. And Vic as Ikaku is bit a surprise, but as always he does an amazing job. I always preferred dubs over subs, and this one of them. So check out the dub first, maybe you might like it. Personally I do not like the sub voices. Plot/Story-9: could be better. Despite the fact most people don't like the plot I'm ok with it. In every arc Ichigo has to fight a a strong bad guy, and he gets stronger an so on. I don't see why people have a problem with the plot. The filler arcs are pretty interesting. And some filler episode are good too. I love the random amount of charters there are. Unllike Naruto with all ninjas. Bleach has all rendom characters (hollows, soul reapers, arrancars, bounts, quincy...) it's very interesting to know the ability of every character. Weapons-10: Like before very character has unique powers, and always fun to find out. Some might have a Zanpakuto, while others have a ceto, or doll, or reseraccion form. Shikai is when the owner finds out the name of his Zanpakuto it turns different shape and size. Ex: Rukia's Sode no Shiroyuki. Bankai or final release: is even a highher level, they become stronger, with all this awsome ability, even their clothes change. Ex: Byakuya's Senbonzakura Kagiyoshi. The fights are epic. With characters revealing there awsome abilities. But also predictable, Ichigo fights, he's good so far, then it seems like he's loosing then at the last moment he wins... Despite all of the complains and all the flaws Bleach has. For me it's my favorite anime serious ever. Few more things: Not much romance: There is no atrraction between Rukia and Ichigo, or Orehime and Ichigo, whatsoever!! But few cute scenes, and a possibly a confession. Enjoyment is 10 because since I watched I don't stop going. Something new and awsome happens in every episode. Overall 9: I have may other anime I could give a 10 to and might be better then bleach. But so far it's my favorite anime. Don't give up on this anime after one episode or just because elf fillers, if you do, you will be missing a lot of excitement. Give this anime a try at keat once, and don't listen to other people bitching about it being waste of time. Hopefully what I wrote make sense, and sorry if something is wrong with my English. Hopefully u will find this anime enjoyable, and this review helpful.",9,Recommended,"Mar 16, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d5837a0bff,16
"when the name bleach is heard the thing that comes to mind is "" one does not simply not watch bleach "" but for some people ""bleach.........faggots faggots faggots who watche bleach is a faggot who made bleach is a faggot"" and keep going on for hours until they realize everyone already left. so for this reason i am writing this review for people who want to give bleach a try but there motivation is destoyed due to 'haters' to start with : story: must say the story is well thought and amazing. personaly i dont think of this as a perfect storyline which normaly hardcore fans do say but its not bad, actualy i really enjoyed it. the plot twists were great and i loved the soul society arc i was crazy for the next episode but as they say what goes up must come down. same happened when the annoying fillers released for eg the zampakto arc. the fillers were not that bad but it created distortions within the story and confused the viewer.but its not like they suck, some of these fillers sometimes made me hahahhahahahhah (why the haha cuz lol is to mainstream) so its still entertaining unless you are the new grumpy cat.i should have metioned it before but the first 20 episode are slow and are just introductry but i think its less then 20, any ways i gave the story a 9/10 art: amazing. the art was very pleasing to me the background the character designs were very well made and what bleach is most famous about is its battles. well they arnt the best but are one of the best the swordfights are simply mindblowing the way the animations were made of those epic scenes were well EPIC. but not just the battles the beautifully made zampaktos and their releases were amazing so for art i give a 9/10 sound: hmmmmmmmmm what should i say lets see.........FRIGGIN FANTASTIC.whenever a bleach episode started going downhill for me the music made me pumped up once again. i have seen many animes and most of them have the same problem the sound isnt in complete sync with the scenes let it be battle scenes or a let it be a conversation between characters some thing just didnt feel right. but when it comes to bleach the sound or background music is completely synced with the scenes.both were working in complete harmony.the voice actors for the characters were also well chosen and performed very well and they never gave me a chance to say ""you had one job!!!!!"" so the music department gets a full 10/10(but still not perfect) characters: the characters were well made and were great each character had a unique ability of their own which no other had and the biggest problem in various series is that the characters arnt well explained but bleach has no issue like this for me most of the characters starting from main to supporting all were well explained and had each had a diffrent storyline about their past (obviously). so for characters i behold a 9/10 my opinion: bleach is a great show to watch but since its one of the mainstream animes nowdays it has a lot of fans and haters and both actualy give a wrong opinion about the show the fans go on babbling that its a perfect show and the other animes go pale infront of it and they over exaggerate about the good points and hide all the cons while the haters do the opposite and hide all the pros and reveal the cons, but thats not very bad because a person who is about to make a journey through 366 episodes should know a lot about the anime before making the step but the haters usualy spice the cons. so what my advise is not to listen to some people and give the show a try trust me i really enjoyed it even though some people actualy discouraged me .and if u dont like it you can call it quits. overall i give it a 9/10 if u dont like the review please dont go nuts as this is my first review",9,Recommended,"Mar 28, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f633013f07,16
"Review 8: Bleach ( let's take a trip to the soul society) bleach is for one completely amazing in every way!!! If you don't like Naruto that much then i think this would suit you way more better. This is mainly about Soul reapers who live in the Soul Society in another realm. Soul Reapers: People who have either died or can see spirits. They have a Reaper form and a Human form in which they can disguise themselves. They fight Hollows to protect Humans and to keep peace in between the realms. Most of the higher ranked Reapers live in the soul Society and armatures live in the Human World. They're job is to protect the humans and try to get rid of Huco Mondo. Hollows: People who have been criminals in their unfortunate lives and have bad souls, they turn into Hollows once they have died. They try to attack other Humans to kill them and attempt to kill the Soul Reapers all of the time. They don't care about one another and have no emmotions apart from Anger, their hideous creatures who will be forever hunted down by the Soul Reapers. Soul Society: The place where all Soul Reapers will go during their life. Many live there many just come and go. In the surronding ares live the spirits of people who have passed away. The place is seperated in to the rich the middle class and the poor, it's all based on who lives there and what it is like there. Theres tons of different characters to meet along the way and it's a brilliant read and even better to watch as they've already finished doing the series even though theres over 9 different series but oh well! Try getting around to watching them all as they ar really cool and action packed, i've started watching it again. lol!!!

"What to say about one of the most popular fan based animes out there? Even if you aren't an anime fan chances are you've heard of Bleach. I was skeptical when I first decided to watch it, as I am some what of an animation snob. I have a heard time watching older animes because I liked the fresh vibrant colors of the newer more ""crips"" anime; but I got over it pretty quickly once the story line about a normal ghost seeing boy inherent the powers of a Shinigami and the adventures and problimamtic tasks they go through. Like most anime, there was lots of filler, and If I figured that out earlier I would have saved a lot of time, however if your into the filler type then this is a good anime for you, if not just do what I did and google online the full episode list and it will show you the fillers with no disruption to the actual timeline. On that note, I do feel like the Arrancar arc was a little dragged out but that also isnt my choice. If the battle scenes weren't literally like 5 episodes a piece then it probably would have been more enjoyable - but its worth it. Overall, the character development, the story lines, and the binds and feelings that come with this anime were all enjoyable and I would probably watch it again.",8,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_79177f6cad,16
"This anime has a lot of episodes so be prepared for a long ride. The main characters are in high school and through odd circumstances end up mixed with a strange and cool characters called soul reapers. There is plenty of action and character building in this. They grow up and gain new powers and form bonds. The Soul reapers are a huge bunch and very different from one another that they stand out. The villains are unique and you get to explore a world not seen before. The little downside is that there is a lot of filler. For my part it was interesting but sadly didn't apply to the main story or was never carried over. The bounts were cool in my opinion. Try this anime if you like lots of action, great catchy music, interesting characters and villains.",10,Recommended,"Mar 14, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_78310a075d,16

"Bleach is basically the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a normal human like you and me who meets a certain shinigami/soul reaper one day and helps them at their most helpless moment. He then gets the power of a shinigami and to that person's surprise, he is a natural at this. The story revolves around shinigami and other kinds of spirits which might not be totally original now but for sure one of my favorite themes ever for anime, There are always lots of potential for complex, deep, and exciting stories and bleach did well on most fields. The art and animation are overall really good, some people say it sometimes was bad and that they rushed the art but I never noticed a single example. I would give it a 9 simply because of the overall over-average-looking art and the effects used throughout the anime. The character design is astonishing, especially the MCs are impossible to forget and they are all really well thought. Each has their beliefs, strong and weak points and they all help each other with their friendship and trust. In conclusion, Bleach is an anime you must watch, it is really well made and it ain't a classic anime for no reason. Both the Story, Art, Music, Characters, and plot are all really good. And the anime just like the other big shounens I mentioned really change you fundamentally.It is still a shounen so don't expect lots of mystery or very intense and original stories, it is quite literally 4 arcs from the manga and like a couple of filler arcs most are about invading some enemy's base and saving a friend or something similar, poor but lots of fun and just legendary. It also has a bit of an issue with fillers that people hate but let's be real if you hate them that much go on animefillerlist and skip the fillers, which are 45% of the anime.",9,Recommended,"Dec 12, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_cecd10629c,16
"Bleach has its highs and lows, especially if you watch the filler arcs. At some times you have bad fights with irrelevant characters that go on for several episodes and other times you have fantastic fights that have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The main villain is simply amazing, the protagonist is ok and other characters shine too ( I won't say any names to avoid spoilers).Since Bleach is old the animation isn't perfect but that does not mean that there won't be good fights, especially towards the end when the animation gets better. It is overall great and, but can be a drag sometimes (mainly in the fillers).

"Bleach is absolutely nostalgic for me, so if you're looking for something unbiased, then please take my opinion on the anime with a grain of salt. I never watched any anime other kids watched growing. Naruto? Not for me, never will be. Dragon Ball? Not that either, don't like the art, don't like the characters. One Piece? Oh, please, don't start with me, no single series deserves the amount of episodes One Piece has gotten, with an episode count like that I guarantee 75% of the series is uninteresting. Bleach was the first anime I ever watched as a kid (Other than some season 1 DVDs of Pokemon a friend gave me). I watched it with my dad, and was absolutely infatuated by Bleach. Its characters? Top notch. Its premise? Stunning. Its weapons and fights? Absolutely incredible. I watched until maybe a bit past the Ulquiorra fight first time around, and with my second watch through now I'm beginning to approach the same point, though this time I expect to finish the show before the release of the final arc later this year. Speaking of the final arc, you have no idea how ecstatic I am to hear they're finally giving the show I proper ending it deserves. If you don't know, the anime was cut off by Shonen Jump in the middle of several story lines and events, I guess it wasn't pulling the numbers Shonen wanted anymore. The show was given thirty episodes to completely wrap up everything the show had going on, which, with an anime sixteen seasons long, you can imagine is a lot to wrap up. As someone who's not even completed the Aizen arc, I can't attest to this personally, but apparently the ending is garbage because of the thirty episode deadline. The new arc is so exciting for me, not just because after I finish the show I'll be able to watch a proper ending to my favourite show of all time, but because it does Bleach justice, and it brings a show with such incredible potential for visuals when it comes to environments and fights and weapons, into a more modern era of animation where those potentials can be realized. But, this isn't a review of the upcoming arc, this is a review for 2004 Bleach. The story can be incredible at times, and, though I wouldn't say less incredible, sullied by its repetitive or generic nature at others. There are tropes that have been used for centuries, which aren't bad by any means, otherwise they'd never have been used for so long, but they are more boring than the more original and exciting parts of the story. Arc 1, pretty generic story wise, though its several generic characters that are used to make up the generic parts of the story are offset by the host of lovable and unique characters the series introduces. For every boring Rukia, there's an interesting shop of Urahara and his colleagues. The second arc doesn't just step up the genius and uniqueness of the show, it straight up launches it into the upper atmosphere where it floats for the entirety of the arc, with an entirely new scenery, a whole host of brand new and unique characters that triples the number of characters in the show overall, tonnes of incredible fights, as well as new and exciting abilities. Arc number three is a filler arc, no two ways about it. Its not part of the main story so none of the characters gain any new or exciting abilities, and nothing of lasting effect occurs. The beginning of the Hueco Mundo arc is where things get spicy again, at least you'd think. The entirety of the Hueco Mundo arc plays out like a spray painted Soul Society arc, a close friend is taken to an alien soul world where 13 enemies are strongest of the bunch (10 Espadas and the 3 defector captains, sounds pretty familiar, eh? Like the 13 captains of the 13 court guard squads?). The bosses of Hueco Mundo even mirror personalities of the captains of the court guard squads, so not only is the concept not unique, neither are the new characters. All that being said, the Soul Society (second) arc is probably the best arc in the entire anime, so its not necessarily bad that it was copied. The new captain Shusuke Amagai arc is a filler arc that interupts the Hueco Mundo arc half way through, with no lasting bearing on the rest of the show, important characters in the arc are either pushed aside afterward and don't have a position in the anime that would mean they'd have to show up later, or the characters that do have too much of an important role that they'd have to be seen after the arc is over end up getting killed to avoid that. After that arc it's back to Hueco Mundo where you get a whopping one short season until another filler arc begins explaining the origins of the Vizored. That's where I am now. My reviews of stuff always turn to the most negative things I can think of about that topic, but know that I don't review things unless they're very important to me. This is the show I spent days watching with my father, before I had a computer, before we had a streaming service, it was this show I'd always die of excitement for when I saw he brought another DVD back from the library. It's got its faults, but in my eyes the parts of it that are good outweigh and outnumber the parts of it that are bad, 100 to 1.",9,Recommended,"Apr 24, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ade854dc01,16

So, lets talk about my expericente with this anime. I taken Bleach to watch one month ago, during my college vacation. One of my brothers watched and recommeded it for me several weeks ago. With 7 rest weeks, it was perfect chance to finally take Bleach. No spoilers, but we have a powerful story here, emotional in several moments. Its great to see history details about all main and secondary cast without needed watching fillers seasons. Talking about cast, its a great ""world"" here, but not so huge/complex like Naruto or One Piece, to example. The best thing about story is the comebacks and big surprises during some arcs, awesome moments. The second best thing is the powerful protagonist. Ichigo Kurosaki have ""simple"" ambitions, fighting only to protect your friends and peoples. And, finally, the relationship Ichigo/Rukia is one of the bests i've seen. Its not a perfect anime, but is very great, and I hope to Pierrot take it back, because its totally possible.

"Honestly, I absolutely fell in love with all the characters in this series. There were very few characters from the main, manga-oriented arcs that I disliked. I have Tumblr blog dedicated to Bleach and Bleach alone because I love it so much. Yes, the story is all over the place. Yes, some of the battles were let downs. Yes, the ending was... questionable. HOWEVER, the character relationships and the phenomenal solo battles and the history of the Shinigami is enough to make anyone fall in love. Be warned: if you're looking for romance, this anime is not for you. It's very heavily a Shōnen anime. Although, that does mean you can have whatever character you want all to yourself... and the thousands of other fans that also fell in love with them. Listen, just watch it.

"This will be a quick review, which shouldn't have any real spoilers. My biggest criticism for bleach is it's filler, which is common for long running Shounen, but still effects the enjoyment of the series. The story starts off strong with a monster of the week style anime focusing on the MC first getting his powers into the soul society arc, which is probably still one of the best arcs that has come out of Shounen Jump to date. The following arc however goes downhill as the entire arc is basically filler, something about vampires, and not very enjoyable. The next few major arcs are kind of formulaic, following the same patterns as the first, which is still enjoyable, but not really anything revolutionary. The Aizan arc which was really the last important arc of the anime was also thoroughly enjoyable, and i remember watching it as it aired. It was basically the climax of the entire series, and it was pretty well done. The music choice in the series is pretty iconic, and the art style uses realistic human proportions (mostly). The one other major flaw i have to point out is the character development. When a character is introduced, the author makes sure you know who they are immediately by making them stand out, but most characters don't really get any attention or development after that aside from flashbacks. The MC has very little significant development, but is noticeably more mature from the beginning to the end of the series. I recommend that if you don't care about the filler, just skip it, there are plenty of lists on which episodes are actually part of the plot. If you haven't picked this anime up because it is too long, just do yourself a favor and watch through the end of Soul Society arc.",8,Recommended,"Jan 22, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_386ff1884b,17
"To be honest , I am a little biased to bleach as it was my very first anime after a long time. Believe me the last anime I watched ,before bleach was Doramon in my THIRD grade. Thus my review can be a bit like a one made by a fanboy....but still let's just get on with it. Bleach is like your typical shounen manga where at first it seems like the protagonist got all these awesome powers by chance but further in the story it is revealed to be somewhat tied to the protagonist's past.Anyway the protagonist Ichigo is a normal highschool boy with normal ass friends. One day he meets Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami who accidentally gives him her powers and from there on their journey begins. To be fair to bleach even if you hate it you cannot ignore the character designs, the scenery and the thought behind the story. Even if you think it should have stopped after the so called best arc i.e. "" the soul society arc"" you cannot help but be awe of the designs of the Espadas . The storyline may be cliché but some of the twists cannot be predicted if you are an anime only as I was at that time. And hey every storyline may be called cliché when compared to other stories before them.The fillers may be long and sometimes boring but some things do carry over to the main story .Also the fights are awesome to look at. And we also get fan service from a few characters. All in all bleach is a good anime for people who are looking for a shounen battle anime .It has its ups and downs but it is still good. So go watch it if you want to see a good anime .just give it a try. Just watch up to the soul society arc and then decide if you want to continue or not . BTW This is my first review as well .

"Bleach has been around for a long time. I remember hearing about it when I was watching scooby doo. (though, to be honest, I still watch/love scooby doo...). I am not usually a huge fan of anime that run FOREVER. D-Gray man was an amazing 130 ep series (and the new season starts soon!!!!!), and I had the same high hopes for bleach. The first 3 seasons of Bleach were the best. You can watch each season in one day or so and be happy. The 4th season was not terrible, but it did get very dry. If I was to rate the anime on the first 3 seasons, it would be story: 10, art: 8, sound: 7, character: 8, enjoyment: 10, overall: 9. My rec is to just watch the first three seasons, but you may like it more than I did. Pros: Storyline is decent. It touches on Shinigami, which is you ever saw death note, they are soul reapers. In bleach the have a lighter feel about them. The characters were both good and bad (good v evil anyone? no? ok...) but Ichigo was a character I liked the entire time. Cons: IT DRUG-ON FOREVER. It would seem like 10 episodes would go by of the same fight. Or the same problem. By the time you finally move on you're bored as hell. First 3 seasons kept you interested. But the rest of the story just got DRY. Had the series ended after season 3, I personally would not be offended. I'll let you be the judge. It is a good anime. Just not one of my favorites. -JNutt22 Edit: I finished the anime about a year after submitting this review.

"Bleach is a very popular anime because its a shonen anime. This makes it immensely popular but not always in a great way. While Bleach starts off good, after the Soul Society Arc, it loses some of its charm. The filler episodes/arcs almost ruin in entirely. However some of the fight scene animations make up for it. Most of the music in Bleach is great and you will listen to it time and time again. At the beginning, it might get kind of confusing with all the squads, but you will get to know them soon enough.

"Though considered to be in league with Naruto and One Piece as the three great Animes of the decade and beyond - it is commercially - initially it is a good anime one with depth, originality, and variation essential to every great anime, but as every anime of great length is prone too, it loses originality and becomes pointlessly predictable. The story initially takes an original stance on shinigami's and their cross-relationship with the human world. As the story progresses, the viewer becomes more and more enticed by the original settings and stunning plot twists, but as the plot reaches the ultimate climax many elements become re-used and thus lose originality and become unbelievably redundant. At this point around episode 320ish is where the conclusion should have been and despite the continuation is ultimately unsatisfying - I will not give any spoilers, for those who are looking to start the series. For those who read the manga and/or anime, the continuation past the Aizen arc is utterly pointless and redundant and ultimately drags down my overall enjoyment and rating of this series. It is the equivalent of a horrible filler and is again predictable. Despite my dislike for Bleach as of now, as I said I have fallen in out of love with this anime, but in the end I have decided to no longer watch and grown to hate Bleach; however, the animation is more realstic is comparable to the detail within Naruto and One Piece, the voice actors are nothing the best, and the artists who have composed the sound track for the anime is simply spectacutlar. I highly admire the strong string aesthetics embedded within the music, as it developes the mood, whether it be sad, intense, are thrilling. Far surpassing One Piece and Naruto in Sound.

I had to almost force myself watch this, the show seems like a lot of repetitive ideas and themes coming into place, whether our protagonist Ichigo has to fight Soul reapers, or protect his friends from Hollows. The show is just the same thing over again, a few weapon swings, some near death experience, and next morning everyone is friendly and unharmed. The characters are hardly in-depth, their back-stories are either cliche or weak. No matter how strong our protagonists get, the antagonist is always one step ahead, but with the power of friendship we can win! The story is long and feels dragged on, their is little to no development personality wise with our main character, Ichigo. The whole story is weak at best, flying monsters in the streets, and nobody knows. A whole other world that nobody can see or know about other than him, and his family. The animations are decent, nothing special. Quality work I suppose. The sounds are mediocre, again, nothing special. Characters made me sick, I'm tired of my main characters mom being dead, and I'm tired of them yelling about how they need to protect their friends. All the characters sides feel forced, I don't get to choose who is good or bad, they're set for me. I cant enjoy a show that drags on this long, they are milking a cow. Overall, 7. It's tolerable, however I would never watch it again, so it's not enjoyable for me.",7,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7a6ccb655d,17
"Bleach started with an interesting concept. The basis is really around the three coexisting worlds (The mortal realm, Soul Society, and Hueco Mundo) and the two spirit world's interactions with the mortal world. The Shinigami and their Zanpakuto make for both interesting character development and an excuse for the artists to make some dazzling and flashy fight scene. The characters themselves are diverse and make for some interesting interactions. The problem with the show that many people, including myself seem to agree upon is the plot line. The initial story arc (Soul Society) and Ichigo Kurusaki's clash against the Gotei 13 contains some great storytelling, compelling character development, and inspiring fight scenes. The apparent lack of true evil in Ichigo's opponents makes it at the more interesting, being a fight between personal justice and the uncompromising law of soul society. If i were judging Bleach based upon just this part of the story I would be giving it much higher score. From this point onwards i begins to go down. As the lines between good and evil become less blurred and the true enemy surfaces the story gets drawn out further and further without really adding any substance to the characters or the plot. It becomes a cycle of fight scenes that are all pretty much the same main-plotlne and filler arcs alike.",7,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e15082a434,17
"Do you like power scales that are as confusing as the movie Mulholland drive? Then you'll probably love this blockbuster shounen. The big three of Naruto, Bleach and One piece are now pretty dead. Bleach is done with no real answer as to whether they will return to finish animating the manga, Naruto is just about over since the Manga is finished, and One piece is about as good as John Wayne Gacy was at being a birthday clown. Naruto, which mainly suffered from story that seemed to have been created along the way and terrible animation later on, and One piece, which suffered from goofy over the top characters and storylines, are nice contrasts to Bleach, which instead, suffers from terrible fillers and even worse power scales. Power scales are very random, and in the case of Ichigo, all it takes is 20 episodes to become stronger than someone who is waay stronger than him, and someone who later beats people much stronger than ichiho, but you're like, ""okay, ichigo beats strong guy but he was weaker, strong guy is strong, barely beats someone who beats ichigo, but ichigo beat him, then strong guy is even stronger, loses to someone weaker than ichigo"" and so on & so on, until you're pulling your hair and wishing someone erased all your memories of Hunter x Hunter so you can rewatch the proper, logical power scales. Leaving aside the power scales for a moment, the plot, which is about as ridiculous as Chris Tucker was in the 5th element, was repeatedly stabbed by fillers. Fillers everywhere. I mean, I think at one point, There was about 40 episodes of filler in a row. I remember not watching the show for about 5 months, and coming back, and the filler was just at its climax. Do you know how long five months is? That's one college semester. 1 shitty relationship. about 18 paychecks. About 350 cumshots & about 1 stephan Hawking speech. It's a long time. The story itself, unlike Naruto, did not create upon itself(though the manga now is a different matter), and was very entertaining. I mean, there's about as many plot holes as there are contradictions in the bible, but boy, Jesus is just so cool yanno? Characters are super cool, and mostly unique, especially considering the different powers everyone has. I mean, in Naruto, there could be like 20 guys who have the same exact power(fire for example) but In bleach, it's pretty unique. Ichigo, our main, is cliche, but he's not as much of a bitch as Naruto was, and gets shit done when he needs to, so there's that. He's still about as predictable as every other main shounen character so don't expect a mona lisa here. & yes, yes, Inoue, the heroin(and I use that term loosely, much like Marsha May's pussy has to be by now) is about as bumbling and as useless as they come, and really just a over the top sexualized character with the personality of a carebear. But her tits are bigger than the death star & I would pay about 1,000,000 prussian franks just to see her animated and fucked. Just remember, don't expect the characters to be amazing. Just focus on their fights and powers and less on their ideals. The art keeps constant, which is very good, and the animation never falters & You will see some of the best animated fights in a shounen you have ever seen. I mean, they are fucking nuts good sometimes. Better than the fucking taco bell box for 5 dollars. The sound also is very well done, and they have some really good ost's and some badass chanting style latin shit, and that stuff always gets me hard (Think Monster theme, or Halo fight music). Endings and openings are memorable, and mostly always good. Whether it's AKFG or Aquatimez or Orange range, you'll more than likely love the music as if it were a fucking corgi-husky mix. Overall: Enjoyment level is enjoyable. Like the fast and the furious movies. But for the love of god, don't you fucking dare try to analyze this shit anime or you will end up with a headache that rivals a jaegar induced hangover or attending a seminar on string theory.",7,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1a91dba39a,17
"When everything is said and done, Soul Society arc was and still is peak shounen. Everything that followed was not as good. Taken as a whole, Bleach has a lot of glaring weak points and is deserving of some of the flak it gets. However, it definitely deserves its place as one of the most important anime of all time. I love the worldbuilding, the epic battles, the attention Kubo paid to character design, THE MUSIC, the memorable scenes and quotes. This was /the/ anime that introduced me to a lot of other anime and I will always have a soft spot for this one.",8,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_153f797372,17
"Bleach isn't all bad. Ichigo is actually a pretty good MC. He's a cool guy and didn't whine and bitch all the time. Great. There are a lot of great, interesting characters throughout the show. Watching them grow and progress was pretty cool. Some of the arcs were initially interesting but dragged on for way too long and got really boring. The number one thing this show suffers from is the ""Ha! You shouldn't have underestimated me and turned your back on a presumed dead opponent"" trope. A lot of shounen have this problem, but Bleach does it more than any show I've ever seen. If you're kinda iffy about the show but have somehow made it past episode 300 or so, the last arc is absolutely worth it. For me it brought the show from a 5-6 up to a 7. I did use a filler guide to only watch the canon.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6af35dc821,17
"I started watching Bleach about a month or so ago due to the fact that we do not get [adult swim[ in the United Kingdom so I had to wait for the DVD release and you know what... It was well worth the wait. Bleach is a long running Shounen anime like One Piece, Naruto, Dragonball Z and Yu-Gi-Oh! and it's still ongoing, Viz Media aquired the license to the series for american brodcast and produced an impressive dub similar to Naruto which was also an impressive dub except for Naruto's voice -_- Overall this anime has it's good points and it's bad points Good points - It's exciting and makes you wan't to watch the next episode - It's long running so it doesn't end suddenly - The opening and ending themes are some of the best I've seen feauturing banfs such as Asian Kung Fu Generation, Yui, Orange Range and Aqua Timez Bad Points - The animation style to me seems dull - Too many fillers - Some charachters are irritating and boring such as that boy from Ichigo's school w'e his name is Anyways thats my review on Bleach Altogether I give it a 10 It fails on some points but the rest completely makes up for it more than it should do",10,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2015b6881b,17

This is my first review on this website I have only been watching anime for probably about a half of year but I do not understand why this anime is to popular. If you like it good for you but this anime can be summed up into one sentence. this anime is like my English papers 50% filler and 50% actual content I really wish I was trying to be funny I am serious I found myself skipping 10 episodes and nothing interesting has actual happened and the pacing of this show is brutally slow I found myself yelling at my computer screen saying come on already. and once I actual got to the fighting scenes it wasn't even worth it the amount of bullshit and time I wasted waiting for a lot of good action wasn't even worth it. I have a feeling this would be a good show if there wasn't so many fucking episodes. now the characters To be blunt there was almost no memorial characters they were basically NPCs. very little to no character development. and dont give me the bullshit I have to watch a certain amount of episodes to review it properly I have watch 75 episodes and I have shit to do with my day besides watching anime.

"This is one of my favorite animes. It's great! The plot is amazing. The characters are amazing. The setting is amazing. The whole anime is just amazing. Now. Fans have been complaining about the anime. I see why. When they first made Bleach. It was a hit. Now....it's just getting...not so good. It's still okay and I still love it. I just think they should have stopped after Aizen got defeated. It would have been so much better. I don't want to be a spoiler for the people who haven't got so far. But as for the people who did get that far. You all know what happened to Ichigo after the whole Aizen thing. I don't think that should have happened. But it did make it pretty interesting. I will admit that. I do recommend this anime to any and everyone. But I will also add that the manga is really getting good right now, then again it's not. That is all.

"Bleach is one of the 'three main anime'. Personally it is my favourite but that is mainly based on the nostalgia (as I watched it when I was younger). A lot of people dislike the show, but I believe that is mainly down to the fact of *cough* 'the too cool for mainstream' *cough* attitude, and ""I'm a hardcore anime watcher, I don't watch any 'entry level anime'""... Or the fact people prefer Naruto or One Piece. Story 8/10 The story has a LOT of plot twists, they will always leave you wanting to watch the next episode and procrastinate the next hour of sleep. However, it can get bland in some places - this is purely because the large amount of episodes the arcs are spread across. I believe the first arc is around 60 episodes so if around 3-4 episodes are dedicated to one fight you might get a little bored if you're more interested in seeing the plot develop and what not - this is the only reason I gave the story an 8/10 instead of a 10/10. As for fillers, they are pretty random but enjoyable. Sometimes they sort of copy the main arcs when it comes to the layout but if you watch it; it's not that noticeable and some fillers you might decide to skip. Art 9/10 Because of the sheer length Bleach has been running you'll find the art style changes throughout. At first the art is more simplistic yet it adds a great comedic effect and really suits the characters' personalities. After the first arc or so it starts to have a more complex design and the animation gets a lot better so if you decide you like the show but don't exactly like the quality at first I definitely recommend you keep watching as it gets so much better. Sound 10/10 The soundtrack is brilliant and diverse. It varies throughout to suit the different arcs however there are some constant tracks you will notice throughout. The voice acting is great as well; it suits the characters and I don't think you'll find any voices particularly annoying. However I found the english dub rather annoying when it came to Orihime and Kon's voices. Character 10/10 Almost every character in Bleach gets their own backstory and some times even a whole episode is dedicated to them. The character development throughout is great, you'll almost feel like you know them. You may get a little confused about if a character is good or bad at times. Enjoyment 9/10 I really enjoyed Bleach. The only thing that brought it down for me was the lengthly arcs and some really random fillers but I find it added to it's uniqueness in a way. Overall 9/10 Bleach may not be everyones cup of tea but if you like animes with a diverse universe (hehe rhymes) then I recommend you try it. Oh and I may sound over positive, I'm not a supa kawaii fangirl (sarcastic use of kawaii, yes?) I just have an odd writing style.",9,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_610d8deac7,17
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER FROM ANIME AND MANGA && My own theories about some unexplained things in anime/manga ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is an anime with great potential which Wasn't used in 80% but this is still good in my opinion , and worth to watch it . For the first time when You watch the story it seems to be really low and maybe predictable but If you will read the story in manga and then rewatch at lest once the full anime of Bleach you will see that the story has more thinks which are so creative and explained/unexplained. But before saying the whole story in this universe there are at least 4 worlds which are connected with each other so we have there of course the Realistic World ( i don't know how to call it ) with the people living there , Karakura city etc. We have also Soul Society the home of Shinigamis (Death Gods ) and also ( only in manga is being shown ) The King Soul's Palace/castle( I don't remember the pro. name of this place ) in which lives The king of soul society and also the unit Gotei 0. And the last known world is Hueco Mundo in which are living the fallen spirits(bad spirits ) Hollows(with their evolution tree). 8/10 Story is simple and the beginning of the entering the new World ( without the King Souls world ) is a kidnapp of Kurosaki's friends. We have at beginning the Arc in which Kurosaki Ichigo is meeting Kuchiki Rukia and gets the Shinigami powers and learning with us also who are the shinigamis who are the hollows and the basics about the rules . Then Rukia is being kidnnaped and we Begin the Soul Society Arc . After fighting-getting strong - fighting losing - getting strong etc. We have information about the ""Hollow"" inside the Ichigo and also about the shinigamis real powers/politics etc. Then we Begin the Arrancar/Visared arc with betrayal of 3 Captains of Soul Society which is the longest . Then we have the Fullbring arc which in my opinion shouldn't be in Bleach universe . In manga we have also the Quincy arc ( Thousand blood war ) . 9/10 Art . This anime is (right now when I am writing it ) a little old , but the art is still nice , the style of drawing the main characters ( without any special colours of hairs , hairstyle and dunno like in meme "" Find a main character "" ) and also the style of look like of Shinigamis , hollows , visared , arrancars , quincys and the others . 10/10 Sound. This anime has a lot of masterpieces some soundtracks people who doesn't seen bleach knows and doesn't know that these osts are from Bleach . Like Treachery , Stand up be strong , Invasion , Fade to black ( there 2 nice ost but the fade to black has names B(number) which I don't remember ) and a lot more of them also the openings themes are really nice the genre similar to rock without any slow songs like Velonica , Ranbu no Melody , Alones , Chu-Bura and more . 10/10 Character . In this anime when we will take every character from every arc(including the manga last arc) and also all fillers there are a lot of original characters and also in overall we will hate/don't like ( in my opinion ofc . ) something like 2-8 characters . Every one is original the main characters Ichigo , Inoue , Sado, Ishida , Rukia and Renji , the captains of soul society , arrancars , bountos , zanpakutous , quincys and more ... 10/10 Enjoyment , Excluding the episodes in which there happens nothing you should enjoy this anime If you really like Shounen and action anime , there are alot of action and fights , also a lot of Sword fights and the originals ""Shikai"" ""Bankai"" and the ""Ressurection "" or ""Wandenreich powers"". Theories and my opinions : Fillers which doesn't succ. Why I think fillers aren't that bad as we think , just look at the ""Fillers arcs"" the bounto one isn't that bad is explained really nice we see there are more people with unusual powers not only Quincys , Inoue and Sado. Also the arc with ""New 3rd unit captains "" isn't that bad but it also isn't good , it's only to watch for a dinner time . The arc with revolution of Zanpakutous also isn't that bad because we can see the personalities and looks likes of the alot of Zanpakutous which we haven't seen in anime and also in manga. I don't know that the people who has read the manga noticed but in Soul Society probably is a really bad education of the next Shinigamis ""soldier"" in units. Because as you can see Rukia in anime said that she only know about Gillians Menos Grande from a books and she didn't know about any Adjuchas or Vasto Lorde . A lot of people doesn't know , Hirako Shinji or even Isshin Shiba from the past history of Soul Society which show how bad education is there , cause none of shinigamis(excluding some captains ) in anime recognise Hirako and also Rukia didn't recognise the Ichigo's father who was the Captain of the 10th unit . How shinigamis and everyone can "" fly "" in anime ( or maybe in manga also ) I think the reason was shown in anime but the people didn't connected this with the World of humans and Soul Society or even with Hueco Mundo as you remember when Ichigo , Ishida and Sado was going trhough the Garganta to Hueco Mundo they had to put heir own Reiatsu to make ""floor"" on air or something similar to vacuum , probably in this connect world "" Garganta "" is easier to make this floor than in Karakura city or in others world's because there isn't probably a strong atmosphere so probably in Karakura city in Soul Society or Hueco Mundo you can ""fly "" by putting your reiatsu under your feets like in Naruto with walking on water . Why only shinigamis died ? As you know from the beginning in anime in universe of world there should ""die"" without possibility of going to Soul Society only the Shinigamis , Bountos , Hollows killed by Quincys and also the victims of Bountos . But why ? That's easy Every human and quincy ( quincy are the humans with unusual powers ) after death they are the spirits with the chain from their body and waiting to be ""accepted / funeraled "" by shinigami or they will become Hollow ( by being eaten or just because of saddnes to some place/world/people) The hollows ( excluding in 100% Uluquiorra ) which got killed by Shinigami should being extracted and become as a normal human spirits to Soul Society and there is starting my theory about the Gillians/Adjuchas/Vasto Lorde /Arrancars after deaths spirits , because theye are a mix of they are mix of the hollows / some of them during evolution changed their own personality etc. so probably after death they can being as a New Human spirit ( which hasn't lived as a Real Human ) to Soul Society , so for par example Starrk or other Arrancar after death should appear in Soul Society as Starrk and arrancar but without hollows power , hole in body and also the hollows masks. The theory which ofc isn't a theory Why Ichigo has 3 powers ? Why I said 3 powers because I am not including in ""powers"" the fullbring because You can learn it , and it's nothing unusual , and also a ""Human"" isn't a power . Shinigami is mixed with Hollow power which we will get information about it in Manga , the Shinigami power is from his father , and the hollow also from his father but he took the Hollow ""White"" from his mother body(inner world) And also you can see that Zangetsu is a Hollow-Zanpakutou because the ""White Ichigo"" is a realy Zangetsu with his hollow powers ( in anime he told it but in other way cause Hichigo said that he is fighting with ""Elder Zangetsu "" about the place in his inner world ) and the last 3rd power is of course the Quincys powers which Ichigo has by blood like the Shinigami powers , because his mother was a Quincy. Also we can think that not only Ichigo in Kurosaki family can has these 3 powers but Karin and Yuzu too . About Kazui we already know it that he has at least unusual shinigamis powers. Next Generation are much mor over powered than the old. There is only one chapter about 2 children Ishika( if I remember well ) and Kazui , they are kids of coursy but you can see clearly that they are in at least lieutentant level . Look Ishikai has at least his sword in Shikai form which is typical to being an one of the officer's/lieutentant in a unit , and also Kazui which has probably also in ""shikai"" form the sword but it can be in ""Bankai"" form because his sword's handle looks like the same as the handle of the Ichigo's False Tensa Zangetsu and also it can explain why his Shinigami Kimono is unusaul which seems to be ""burning"" around the Kazui body .",10,Recommended,"Feb 10, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5f40a64cf5,17
"This anime is an odd one, so lets jump straight into this pool of death and decay. Bleach had potential (and still has if it ever gets the Dragonball Kai treatment), the first few seasons were great, all of which have to do with the Soul Society (further more called SoSo by me, because SS might be a bit to offensive) and Ichigo's struggle against the hollows, which are evil spirits who have holes in their body (The show quickly explains why so I will not do it). The SoSo is where people go when they died, not exactly heaven, but you do not age, have hunger and no pain. The SoSo is protected by shinigami/reapers/soul reapers, who are the collectors of lost souls. Ichigo is a ""normal"" teenage punk, with the exception that he can see spirits, he deals with it better then I would. One day his family gets attacked by a hollow and almost get saved by areaper called Rukia, who gives her powers to Ichigo, who then becomes a reaper and kicks some ass with a giant sword. The rest of the story will be told by me like a speeding train, so no details. Rukia gets captured, Ichigo loses his powers, regains them with a friendly shopkeepers help, learns to activate the swords secret power, goes to the SoSo, fights normal reapers, number 3's, lieutenants and my favorite character of the show Ken-chan, unlocks the more secret power of his sword (bankai), tries to save rukia, fight, fight, fight, reveal of the big evil guy! And then the story goes down the hill of decent to ""lets have a tournament"" level (Same amount of effort put into it, no actual tournament takes place) and loads of fillers will take place (the only filler worth a damn is the beach episode). The fights though go slightly uphill though. Now lets get back to Ken-chan, Ken is the character that got me to sit through 366 episodes (including the filler), because when he is on the screen you know something will go down. When he fights, he laughs and it is contagious as the common cold. My second favorite character from the show was Retsu Unohanna and I have no idea why, she just has an aura that gives me enjoyment. So overall it becomes a 6, in my opinion a story and the characters are the most important aspect of an anime and the main characters stop being interesting and quick too. If the fillers were out of the picture it would overall be a 7. So lets hope that in 7 or 10 years we will have something like ""Bleach, yes we took the fillers out, 2022"".",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b39e878f93,18
"Bleach: One of the mainstays of the shounen genre. Bleach's contribution to popular culture cannot be argued. It's quality, however, definitely can. Even before I became a gigantic anime weeb a few years ago, I had heard about Bleach. It was always right up there with Naruto, One Piece, and Fairy Tale in terms of easily recognizable animes. Bleach has it's fair share of good points. The cinematography is pretty good, the voice acting is incredible (in the sub at least), and the OST's are high quality. The show also does an acceptable job in terms of character development (other than the main character, who get's a ton of development). It's nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. I've had a few problems throughout the life of the show that I think are worth pointing out. First off, the length. I've generally found that throughout my anime experiences up until now, length can be a significant contributing factor to how enjoyable the end product is. Obviously, how much the length affects a series depends on a variety of factors, namely genre and story pacing. For example, if Show A is a comedy/slice of life with no complex plot, you will be more likely to have success with a smaller length than you would with Show B, an action/adventure with an ensemble cast and heavy character development. Even after taking this in to consideration, I just found myself loosing interest in Bleach more often that I expected. It can get hard to watch a show when you need to watch 30 episodes before seeing anything significant happen. What can I say, I'm just impatient that way. Bleach was just too lengthy for me. Another concern I ended up having with the series was the overly cyclical plot. After a couple arcs, once the novelty of the series had worn off, I found the same cycle repeating itself. Step One: The main character gets destroyed by a powerful opponent, Step Two: The main character develops an awesome new power, Step Three: The main character barely beats the same opponent in a long, drawn out battle, Step Four: Repeat. The show did a decent job of making the fight scenes somewhat suspenseful (mostly done by trying to make us hate the villains by giving them all uniquely irritating personalities), but in the end you knew what the result was going to be. Finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the filler arcs. Oh the filler. Wow the filler. SO. MUCH. FILLER. I kid you not, 45% of Bleach is filler. Why so high? Well.... mainly because of the fact that the producers were repeatedly catching up with the author, Tite Kubo, and they apparently felt that it would be better to show terrible, meaningless filler just to keep milking the fans for money, rather than take a break for a while to preserve the integrity of the show. Is anyone going to stop watching Attack on Titan just because it took a break so the manga could get ahead? No. What I would recommend is looking up a filler arc guide before starting the series, so you can be ready to skip the filler. If you are absolutely insistant upon watching the filler, please limit yourself to only watching the Gotei 13 Arc (eps 317-342). It was, in my opinion, the only filler arc worth watching. Overall, decent show, way overrated, not for everyone. Give it a shot though. Regardless of it's shortcomings, Bleach is something everyone should experience.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 14, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3f6ac86152,18
"This will be ridden with personal bias. I will do everything in my power to explain that bias so as to best relay exactly why I feel the way I do, but I can't say I'm terribly apologetic if my values do not coincide with yours. Bleach's strong suits became very apparent in the earliest stages of its existence; the stellar fight choreography, creative and dark designs worked around it, and tasteful themes managed a level of accessibility that was pretty impressive for its 'type' of shounen. The characters didn't show any kind of excessive depth, but really it never became anything too consequential, since at this point the immersion of the world (which, very interesting as a concept, at least at this stage) carried nicely. As the Soul Society Arc began to open up, almost everything got an overhaul; more (and better) fight sequences, an immersive setting, and an overarching plot that held everything together so precisely it hurt a little. This was, as I see it, when the show was at it's peak, having set up these set of circumstances nicely and allowed itself the liberty to play out and focus on what it did best. No spoilers, of course, but as all the elements of this arc began to draw together, it set up one of the best finales of its time, plain and simple. It was an amazing display of long-term writing and concise story-telling, and was it not for the obvious set-up it established, I'd have been entirely satisfied with the series concluding there. However, it kept going, and as it did the issues with the anime began to show. That focus the seasons prior showed to where exactly the series was headed was no longer apparent, showcased no better than by a blatant rip of Vegeta and Nappa's descent to Earth established in the very opening of the Arrancar arc. The events proceeding felt more like segues to the next fight sequence than they did development of a greater plot, and coincidence seemed to drive far more elements than one might like. Furthermore, as the character cast began to expand and receive more time for development, Tite Kubo's lack of depth as a character writer began to show, with more and more one-note antagonists began to pop up. The plot now felt much more tied to convention than before, which sliced into what was a real strong-suit of the more liberal, previous arc. It was at this point that I think fans began to see the writing on the walls, and while many would still follow it on the merit of still-solid fight sequences and decent atmosphere, a lot of what made the series great had been lost. The filler arcs and the ""canon"" proceeding the Arrancar arc were acting extensions of the issues previously established; as the lore of the world expanded, the tone and portrayal of it all did not, leaving a gap of uncertainty that really cut into the overall immersion of the anime. Kubo has been trying to intertwine similar elements of his early successes into his proceeding arcs (significantly the ideas of in-fighting between factions), but none of them really tend to go anywhere, which is upsetting for someone who saw it done so well by that very person. In spite of all the negatives I note with this anime, I feel strongly that it does have a lot of enjoyable qualities to it, and I'd argue that the Soul Society arc is something of a modern masterpiece. It is heavily overrated for sure, but there is an obvious appeal to aspects of it, and if you can forgive the plot contrivances and somewhat underwhelming character focus in the later bits, then Bleach can be a pretty fun watch.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 7, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_198847fee4,18
"Subjective in my opinion - 8/10 The theme is good, about the god of death. - 10/10 The organizational system is very clear, in my opinion this bleach has the clearest organizational structure of the anime I've ever watched. - 8/10 The skill system is clear and explained in detail - 7/10 The plot is ordinary, the pattern of fighting, defeat, victory, extra skills after the fight - 8/10 The usual MC character (naive as usual) - 9/10 The introduction of each character and skill is very clear. - 9/10 The MC portion is good, the story runs parallel and is not too excessive in highlighting the MC. - 9/10 Good visuals, considering the year it was published, in my opinion bleach is one of the anime with the best visuals.",9,Recommended,"Sep 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ffd2300e93,18
"This show had a lot of potential with interesting characters and plots. However, it became more and more filler including even a few seasons entirely of irrelevant filler content. On top of that, the lines and fight scenes were ridiculously repetitive. The fighting became absurd as the show went on. When the main character acted cool and made the fights interesting, the fights would end abruptly and the show would become intensely boring again. Truly what killed this show was the seasons of pure filler. The entire series ended on a filler season as well. Many things went unexplained while having infinite time to cover irrelevant topics and characters that would be thought up and erased in the same filler season. It had its moments, but the were few and far between.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 7, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a675d769b9,18
"I absolutely love this anime... for its use as MAL fodder to get the days up. I mostly watched this show muted because I would be reading the latest updates to my favorite manga Bleach, it has a similar story and funnily enough have the same dogshit ending. The mc looks the same as well, but one of them is a ginger??? The overall plot for this anime is really confusing, just like in the manga copy, the characters that had the name Ichigo were crazy overpowered!! With the amount of plot armor he has 6235 years would pass before he breaks a fucking nail. Baited shitter, I bet u thought something competent would be behind that read more tab. Cyberpunk edgerunners was dogshit, mobile suit gundam 00 is dogshit, 86 is mega dogshit (the characters sucked), grand blue was dog shit (I was just tryna find the episode that they fucked (they didn’t)), clannad wasn’t even sad, violet evergarden was so stretched, anohana was dogshit the first episode was 1 scene away from being a trending code, and valvrave is meat.

"I'm someone who tries to enjoy everything but let me tell you right now, you won't get any enjoyement from this anime if you have above a room temperature IQ and I'm talking in celcius here. The first 3 seasons are decent to even quite good. The story makes sense, it's pretty fluid, the characters have logical development and the power scale mostly makes sense. Once that first main storyline is over though, everything gets out of hands. Orihime and Rukia became damsel in distress for most of the anime and both were pretty useless throughout the whole thing. Before anyone mentions how Orihime can heal people, nobody needs that in Bleach. We've seen many characters time and time again on the brink of death and yet all of a sudden they'd get a pokemon evolution on the battlefield and it would regenerate all their spirit energy. This leads to another major complaint, plot armor. The mangaka must have had no vision for his story because he kept writing himself into a corner and instead of thinking things through and trying to fix his many mistakes, everything has always been fixed by plot armor which makes the whole anime illogical if illogical things happen all the time for no good reason. The one saving grace of shonnen usually is the fights but if that's what you're here for, sorry to disappoint but you won't get that here either. The power scale is wack, the power ups don't make sense, training is non-existent, those power ups happen when they need plot armor to save them in the middle of a fight they weren't ready for. Also, if anyone is like me and never liked how all of Naruto's attacks are rasengan-like, Ichigo is worse because all he has is his rasengan. The battles are boring and uninspired. Another big issue is the pacing. Every other minute there is what they try to portray as an ""'epic"" moment with a lot of look backs, quick cuts, slow motion, etc. but if every scene is epic then none is. The whole styling of battles is just terrible. I recommend Black Clover, Shield Hero, Re Zero, HxH and The Promised Neverland if you wanna watch some quality.",2,Not Recommended,"Aug 7, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3fd3a6520b,18
"Bleach, one of the three biggest Shounen of the 2000s Decade. I remember seeing this on Toonami when I was sixteen years old. Now, as 26 (soon to be 27 in a few days) I look back at the anime that has actually changed my life (since it made me interested in Anime and Manga) STORY: 6/10 Bleach has up and down moments with the story. As I try my best not to give anything away. There is a boy named Ichigo Kurosaki, a normal teenager (a reminder that several of the main characters ages are 15 with not looking 15 at all) gains Shinigami Powers and gets into a lot of messes with his friends and a group called the Gotei 13. Bleach first 60 episodes are a definite watch, in fact, it's probably one of the best Shonen Arcs of all time. And I'm not being a fanboy, being objective, it does all the stuff except pacing (not even bad) great. Possibly 9/10 rating IMO. After that, it goes downhill because it's basically a repeat (same thing in Manga too) of the same arc. Lacking any creativity. It's still entertaining as hell. The Fights and Animation are BEAUTIFUL (Bleach 60 fps is some of the best things I have watched in Anime.) Not to mention the constant fillers (45% of it is Filler) brings it down. The story could have been better, but Tite Kubo decided less originality and constant deus ex machinas. ART: 8/10 Although the Artwork in the Manga isn't good at all (""White Backgrounds there! And there! EVERYWHERE HA HA""-Tite Kubo), the animation is amazing. Better than Naruto, One Piece, Gintama, Fairy Tail, etc. for sure. Most consistent too. Like I said, watch 60 fps Fights, you're jaw is going to drop. SOUND: 10/10 It's Shiro Sagisu, what do you expect? Cometh The Hour, Invasion, Will of Heart, etc. still listen to this day. CHARACTER: 5/10 WHY KUBO? WHY???? WHY IS ICHIGO EVERYTHING? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.- You when/if you finish this anime. OMG, I cannot stress to you how many wasted characters are in this anime. Trust me, don't expect any but Ichigo, Uryu, Renji, Rukia, and Orihime to get a lot of screentime. That being said, Characters aren't bad or anything, it's just they're wasted. Bleach has a large cast, and Kubo made sure that you would be able to connect with at least one, and it's awesome of how he does that. There are little Background stories and the Villains come off of just being there to be your Saturday Day Cartoon Villains (except ones like Aizen and Ulquiorra lol) Overall, like the story, it could have been better, but it's what we got and you can enjoy it or hate it. ENJOYMENT: 7/10 You like Battles? Must watch. Do you like Adventure? You can watch. Do you like Romance? NOT HERE unless if you're a typical Shounen shipper Do you like Badass Characters? Must watch. Do you like DBZ with Swords? Must watch. You Like Great Stories and Characters? Eh, for 60 episodes at least but drop it. OVERALL: 7/10 It's better than Naruto for sure, but it still falls under the ""Classic Shounen Anime Syndrome"" This show had so much potential, but it fell flat, but it's still worth watching and even buying. Hope this helped you.",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_982d94fcea,18
"NOTE: While I have seen the entirety of bleach (fillers included) many years ago, I am only formally writing a review for the first three seasons (aka 2 arcs) of bleach since I and most of the fanbase agrees that is when the show was at its best. I remember getting into bleach after I had been into DBZ and Naruto for a while. The show hooked me instantly with its dark and grim esthetic and the characteristics of the world. At that moment, I think I realized that anime could be dark, violent, and bloody (although bleach isn’t that violent or bloody compared to anime I watched later). The core things which hooked me on bleach was its brash main character ichigo, the characteristics of the world, and the unique system of powers. Ichigo appeals to me even today by being a character that knows how to fight, who speaks his mind whenever he wishes, and stands up for what he believes. It is a characteristic that most great shounen protagonists share. As a character, he connects with me instantly when I see him struggle to protect his family from hollows who want to devour them. The way Ichigo gets his power to protect those he loves from hollows also sets up his relationship with Rukia, who is arguably the character Ichigo is closest with over the course of the show. It is interesting to see how Rukia connects with him and convinces him to gradually adopt the role of soul reaper even though he is unwilling at first. One thing that makes bleach unique, at least for the time, was the fact that the story took place in the human world. This makes it more identifiable to the viewer. The characters are also more relatable in some ways than other shounen characters. Ichigo is a malcontent who is consistently getting into fights and walks around with a scowl on his face. He doesn’t act this way for no reason though. He has suffered loss in the past and him becoming a soul reaper largely represents him trying to make up for that past loss. Rukia has to learn to rely on Ichigo and contend with her own helplessness in the face of hollows when her powers disappear. Chad, despite his extensive strength, only fights to protect others. Uruyu holds resentment against the soul reapers due to past injustice but has to gradually learn to work together with Ichigo despite him being something he despises. Otohime does lack significantly in terms of character backstory and development, but she is at least a nice character and has some fun goofy, bubbly moments which make her likeable enough. The first arc of the anime largely acts as a sort of the monster of the week format. However, it doesn’t get tiresome because each episode gradually reveals more information about the world and characters. There are even moments of genuine emotion such as where Ichigo has to confront a key aspect of his past. This first arc also helps to establish strong bonds between the characters which become significant in the second arc. The second arc is where the show really picks up. Rukia gets kidnapped to the soul society and Ichigo and his friends have to rescue her. This is where the show introduces the concept of the soul society, its politics and structure, and the zanpakto. As stated by a youtuber named super eyepatch wolf in his video “The fall of bleach”. This arc of bleach seems to represent the period of emerging adulthood where teens are thrown into the adult world and have to work to understand it. In many ways, the soul society represents a society bound by tradition, rigid hierarchy, and harsh punishment. When Rukia is at risk for punishment by this society, Ichigo seeks to save her, thus rebelling against the structures he himself is supposed to be a part of as a soul reaper. Part of what makes this arc particularly great is that there is a large degree of mystery, intrigue, and uncertainty. Going in, the viewer and characters are aware they are going to be facing entire armies of people and individuals with unbelievable power. Unlike many other shounen anime out there, we often see characters lose fights, afraid of death, overcoming extensive odds, etc. Many times, the viewer isn’t even sure how fights will go. The fights in this arc are top notch. While the concept behind bleach isn’t completely unique, I love how each soul reaper has a unique power and it influences their fighting styles. The fights in this arc are some of the best in the whole series such as: Ichigo vs Kenpachi, Ichigo vs Byakuya, Uduyu vs kurotsuchi, etc. Even while all these fights are going on, there is still a ominous subtext in the show such as growing suspicion over a murder, conspiracy, hidden villans, etc. This arc is great because it expanded significantly on the first, added in a large diverse cast of characters, fleshed out the world, power system, character backstories and relationships, and threw in a couple of good twists. At its core, the first 60 episodes of this show was about Ichigo’s life being dramatically changed, him becoming close friends with a variety of characters, and risking his own life to save his friend. Even beyond that, the show becomes so much more. Even while rewatching the show, I was still binging it to get to the great fights and plot twists. To this day, it is still one of the most solid arcs I have seen in anime. While it is disappointing that bleach dramatically fell off after this arc with rehashed story lines, once dynamic characters becoming static, extensive filler, and increasingly absurd fights, I still treasure the first 2 arcs of this show. This is when the show was at his best. I still remembered the OST even after not watching bleach for many years. I never skipped the first opening. I remembered every character’s name and abilities. If bleach had ended after this arc, I think it would have been held up as an all time great instead of a infamous example of filler and lack of development. The relationships between characters still hook me to this day and I can look back at these arcs as moments of great unadulterated content. Feel free to drop the show after the first 2 arcs though.",8,Recommended,"Jul 26, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c8838d25ce,18
"Plz note that this a review based on a manga and anime as well (no major manga spoilers). first let me say this anime has one of the best op's and theme songs u will ever get to hear (invasion), also some pretty good fights. And how could I not mention the infamous Soul Society arc. This is a must watch, it's undoubtedly one of the best arcs in shounen anime. The animation is pretty good too. And i personally think Bleach's artwork is the best in all of shounen. It's just that none of the other arcs could match the soul society arc, the arrancar saga was too dragged out and riddled with fillers here and there, but Ichigo Vs Ulquiora being the obvious best fight of this anime. And what came afterwards didn't meet anyone's expectations. Yes I'm talking bout Aizen getting taken out with a single attack and Gin's pointless sacrifice (seriously why would u wait god knows how many years plotting to kill someone only to try when they are immortal). And the Fullbringer arc was boring AF despite the animation being good. And then the anime got cancelled coz of bad relations with Kubo and his editors. He never gave his full effort into drawing in the last few years, the background was blank, the characters didn't look lively and that final fight was even more disappointing than the Aizen fight. One way to prove this the rapid decline of sales in Bleach's last years (ending up in 13 place). I feel it wasted a lot of potential and could've been a lot better howeve still i hold it very special in my heart and recommend you guys to watch the Soul Society arc and the Arrancar saga too, after that just drop the series. Read the manga if u've nothing better to do, the TYBW also is riddled with plotholes. I' m hoping Bleach 2021 can fix all of this.",7,Recommended,"Aug 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45c0ee79f4,18

As for the art, it is perfectly clear that the art was a masterpiece undoubtedly...The blood scenes were perfectly clear and interesting.. The sound forms also a great effect in the Anime especially in those intense scenes..For a glimpse of the OST just google Bleach OST Treachery Bleach OST Invasion They are extremely great..

The characters are very well versed and help push the plot forward and there are many secrets to the story revealed later. Albeit the last few episodes are a let down, and if they continued with the current manga arc it would be magnificent.

"Story : I can see that Bleach has its own plot pattern which is the conflicts begin and ended up main character fight with the mastermind. There's nothing that can make people captivated in terms of plot. The fillers worsen the story timeline as well. However, everything that is linked to the story somehow seasoned the story and the story becomes interesting with all the flashbacks and the curiosity the story gives you. Art : The art is good. Sound : The soundtracks are good enough to make you captivated. Character : The only character development I can see is in the Shinigami. The main character doesn't develop much. Enjoyment : I personally enjoyed this anime a lot. All the battles, sad moments, flashbacks and the story combined and make it a good anime that is worth to give it a try. Overall : A good anime, well, but not the best. Despite the major flaws this anime has, it's unfair to say it's bad just because of that.

The flaw they say are the filler episodes and I agree but personally I found some sagas of filler episodes very beautiful for example the saga of the alternative history of the Zanpackutō and the Saga of the invading army of the Thirteen Brigades. I found the characters very interesting starting from the protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki who seems cold and detached and who likes to get into fights, but in reality he is good and is always ready to help his friends if they are in difficulty. There are also other very interesting characters such as Renji Abarai, Zaraki Kempachi, Kira Izuru and others, each with their strengths and weaknesses. And they all have their own personal evolution which I really liked. I liked the story in general, some moments more than others, I found it boring at the beginning but then as I progressed I liked it a lot, above all the fights are well done and some had me very excited, I also found some of the protagonist's transformations fantastic.

With its gripping storyline, intense action sequences, and memorable characters, the series has become a staple in the anime community. The story follows Ichigo Kurosaki, a high school student with the ability to see ghosts. After gaining Soul Reaper powers, he embarks on a journey to protect humanity from evil spirits and uncover the truth behind his newfound abilities. As the plot unfolds, Ichigo encounters powerful enemies, forms alliances with other Soul Reapers, and delves into the rich mythology of the series. Another highlight of Bleach is its stunning animation and fight sequences. The battles are beautifully choreographed, showcasing a wide range of unique abilities and powers possessed by the characters. Each fight is a visual spectacle, blending fluid animation with impactful special effects to create breathtaking moments that leave viewers in awe. Bleach also boasts a diverse cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities and motivations. From the charismatic Ichigo to the enigmatic Soul Reaper captain, Sōsuke Aizen, the series offers a rich tapestry of complex individuals that leave a lasting impression. The relationships and dynamics between the characters add depth to the story, and the interactions are filled with humor, drama, and camaraderie. While Bleach has garnered praise for its exhilarating action and captivating storytelling, some viewers have noted that the series can occasionally suffer from pacing issues, particularly during certain arcs.

"--WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS-- I think Bleach is good because everything is nearly perfect expect Orihime says ""Kurosaki-kun"" a lot of times in an episode. Overall 8 points. ***** Story: In fact Bleach has a good story. And this story continues. But sometimes it gets stuck and Ichigo gets a power-up. That's annoying. And story isn't completed in the anime, that gets on nerve a bit. (if it will be completed, I edit.) Anyway, I love the story and I find myself. 9/10 Sound: I think Bleach's openings are flawless and in-anime musics composed pretty good. 10/10 Art: Bleach's concept seperated to two to me: opening and in-anime. In openings, Bleach's concept is modern, fresh. I love it! In anime, Bleach's concept is a bit traditional because of shinigami outfits etc. But I love this, too. 10/10 Enjoyment: To me, I enjoyed on early episodes to Fake Karakura arc. I haven't liked Fake Karakura arc because pre-episode (brief summary of previous episode) parts are very boring. But I like battle scenes. <3 8/10 Character: Bleach's characters strong but if you compare with Ichigo Kurosaki, they're nothing. The story has made Ichigo an overpower. He is shinigami at one and quincy, Vasto Lorde, Fullbringer.

"I realize not everyone will like this anime, and I can generally understand why. It can be incredibly weak at times and it's got so much filler, it's difficult to know what is canon and what isn't. At any rate, it's one of my favorites. I will be skipping any filler exposition in this part. As I've seen people say many times before, the first major plotline is the best (1-63). I completely agree there because it has well done character development, a pretty good story, and very little unexplained successes (by that, I mean very few asspulls). What it does extremely well here, and throughout, is foreshadowing. As an example, Ichigo somehow gets a hollow mask when he's fighting Byakuya. Seems unexplained right? Just wait a little longer and everything starts to come together. At this point, character development shifts from the main characters (Ichigo, Chad, Orihime, and Uryu) to the captains, vice captains, and some seated officers of the Soul Society. It also explains the hollowfication that Ichigo displayed when fighting Byakuya. The story at this part is rough, I'll admit, but the change of scenery to Hueco Mundo, the focus on blurring the line between hollow and soul reaper, and explanations of strange/powerful abilities was interesting. Not to mention, Aizen was a pretty badass villian, Ichigo was just more badass. The weakest part to me is what happens next when Ichigo looses his powers. Again. Then goes through the process of fighting and training to get them back. Again. This time he gets the new (but Chad it all along) Fullbring power. What I love about this part is that the villain of this arc wasn't who I was expecting at all, so that twist was refreshing. This arc also shows Ichigo knows how to assess his situation and change his tactics accordingly, since his Fullbring power wasn't nearly as strong as his Soul Reaper power initially. Always nice when there is more character development. That last arc is by far the weakest in my opinion because of the repeat of events in a different setting and the ending doesn't help it at all. Fillers are a huge downfall of this anime. After the first arc, you get a filler arc at least every 20 episodes and then it wastes one more entire episode making sure you're up to speed with what happened because it was so long ago. While the first filler arc (Bount Arc) tied in nicely with the world built as a whole, none of the others did. Not to mention the other fillers took place in the middle of a major arc so where the characters were located made no sense most of the time. For example, Ichigo is busy in Hueco Mundo and a filler arc happens that places him in Karakura Town like nothing happened.

The characters are many and therefore, there isnt much development for them, like with Ichigo, it seems he only has honour, protectiveness for his friends, a slightly arrogant nature who isnt all that bothered by the fact there's a hollow living inside of him and to me personally, i havent seen any other side to him; it was very disappointing to see Tite Kubo ignore other feelings of his because if they had focused on them a little bit more, it would have added more of a depth to Ichigo's character. (Suggestion: like maybe he could have had a crush on Rukia or something and believe it or not, but most fans of this anime think the author will put Ichigo and Rukia together at the end, which is just another reason to watch it because whilst there have been hints throughout, there hasnt been anything substantial going on between them lol I'm afraid though that its just a fan's opinion and not even a spoiler so we just have to wait and see about the relationship side of things :P) However, the language used, art and the awesome battles between him and his opponents more than make up for Ichigo's 2 dimensional personality!! Sometimes its funny, sometimes its moving, its nearly always filled with tension so you are gripped with wanting to find out what happens next, its awesome!! The plots are very good too and Ichigo's forms and strength just keep getting better and better, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good action shounen anime to watch! :P",8,Recommended,"Aug 26, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0357d24680,19
"I started watching Bleach 2 years ago and it was the first anime I watched and it remains my favorite anime ever. The characters are awesome, the action is outstanding, everything is just the best. The plot is really good too. I loved it so much! And if you liked this, you'll like Ao no Exorcist (slightly similar plot).

"Oh Bleach...have we certainly had our times together...through good...through bad...oh, the memories... Bleach will always be the anime that pushed me over the edge to take anime more seriously, like it satisfied a yearning. If you think this is going to be an expression of fanboyism then you will be gravely mistaken...I'm sure others in the shonen block of works would fare the same. But Bleach will always be my first and I'll always have a love for it because of that. I jumped into the fray and binged the 180 episodes in existence at the time. The thing that fascinated me most is no matter how overpowered Ichigo seemed to get it was never quite enough for the next arc. But that was one of the great things about being able to binge and the annoyances of waiting week to week is with an extraordinarily large cast of characters it was interesting to look back and see how much everyone grew over time. Perhaps this I can just copy and paste to all the shonen category...and frankly I don't even want to get more specific...it is what it is. I will never declare Bleach is better or worse than a Naruto or One Piece because really...it's just different flavors of the same food. We get to journey with a plethora of characters, discover weaknesses in their strength or character or state of being and see if they overcome. Sometimes it takes too long...sometimes it's like it happens and you wonder, what the hell?!? The thing that has and will always capture me (*NON SPOILER*) that a certain payoff takes nearly 200 episodes to occur...and it was a powerhouse. That's the thing that will always captivate me with Bleach...you do seem to get just enough time to really understand some very distinct personalities (credit to Tite Kubo for that) and have some solid moments of clarity that make you fall in love with the righteous and the malicious, whether it's Ichigo's determination to protect, or Byakuya's Pride, or Grimmjow's desire to be the best...each person has their fight and it's a lot of fun to see how and if they grow and at what length they'll go to achieve. Pros: One of the things that drew me in was a particular fight that took 3 episodes...that combined with the art style of the opening was like a moment of 'where have you been all my life?!?' And yes, if that's not your cup of tea no pop shonen anime is for you. Cons: The obvious. You gotta fill 366 episodes, right? Some arcs took way longer to resolve than necessary. I won't even disparage the 'useless' arcs...even with obvious fillers you get to learn a bit more about the world. It ends suddenly. The zanpakuto arc had 2 arcs...the last arc buttons it up in the last 5 minutes. C'mon, you spend hundreds of episodes giving me overdrawn characters and fights but it's okay to cut the last arc and be all like 'hey, here's the end credits, we're done now, bye bye!'

"I thought the progression and pace of the show was good, and it got more interesting as it went on as well, dimension travel and all that jazz, the vizard stuff was my favorite part of it. As the show goes on these ""side"" characters that you think are worthless and not really even needed slowly become an integral part of the story as well, It happens pretty slowly and gives you the sense that all the characters are growing and are essential to the story. I loved the first 220ish episodes of this series but dropped it around then. It suffers from the typical things that most long anime series do, it has crappy fillers and there is always a new final final version of a move which is faster then the last move which was the fastest move they have every seen, and a new stronger enemy who is stronger then the last guy who said he was the strongest, you get the point.",7,Recommended,"Oct 22, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e76044a74a,19
"This anime is the one that made me start watching anime seriously but now that rewatched it wholly,it feels quite dull somehow.Let me tell you the reasons: Story(6/10) The story is pretty simple,Ichigo who can see spirits meets Rukia and because he warant to protect his friends and family from Hollows,Rukia gives him (supposedly) part of her powers.Because that wasn't allowed she gets sentenced to execution and Ichigo and his friends set to save her and of course,to do that he has to fight all kinds of enemies who become his comrades later on.From here,it gets quite repetitive and he has to save someone every time and it's got lots of fillers who are boring af.It should have ended with him fighting the big bad boss Aizen but they throw us some other fillers and continue a bit after with the time skip,so yeah...I liked the last arc 'cause they approached it a little differently though Art(7/10) At first the art looks old school,blurry,the details aren't so well defined and the resolution is bad but later on it gets too look gorgeous.The girls and the guys are hot if you ask me,there isn't too much fan service but you have what to look at whether you're a girl or boy.I loved the Espada's look and Ichigo's outfits(and looks of course) Sound(8/10) I liked the music and I really loved most of the openings but some of the endings seemed out of place while others fit perfectly.I liked the OST that they played when Ichigo fought too,it's exciting,I guess.Their voices were alright too and fit the characters personality.We even have Sasuke's voice actor for Ishida. Character(7/10) The MC is cool and has some interesting powers but throught the whole anime he doesn't change and still remains kind and his only goal is to ''protect''.I wanted some kind of revelation,a tick,that would change his persepective more.His companions are mostly there to cheer him on because he has to be the hero.And the villains are way too overpowered sometimes.Especially Aizen,that conceited sheit.I liked the characters but didn't feel that much of a connection with them.Between all the fights and all the things going on I get...passive. Enjoyment(7/10) Sometimes I enjoyed it and sometimes I did not.It's hard to stay focused when there are so many fights going on without talking to much or breaks in general. Overall(7/10) If you like cool sword fighting scenes you are at the right place but if you want some real deep stuff this is so-so.It gave me a ''meh'' feeling in the end.It's not special,and it's hard to stay hooked on such a long series I liked it mostly because of the nostalgia,to be honest.",7,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fb2d7ff5ef,19
"Bleach: A spoiler free review, and an honorary thank you. Bleach was my first anime. It was a show I watched that looking back, defined my youth in the early 2000's. It got me into monster of the weeks and ghosts and drawing everything like it's about to throw down. At the time, I thought it was the greatest thing ever written, only to grow a decade older and see it's unfortunate flaws. This review is hard due to me trying not to spoil it, even though anyone reading this probably has seen the show, or knows enough of it to understand what I'm going to convey anyway, but I'm writing this review on behalf of a show that gave me something to look forward to in a time of dreamless nights, and for a possible reader that either missed the hype a decade ago, or was too young to know it even existed. I will never suggest someone to watch this show. It is too long. It is too much of a commitment for so little. And yes I will praise the design, music and a handful of episodes, but in no way would I say someone should watch this. This was a show of its time. One I am very nostalgic for. You couldn't really do something like this today. This is a show about the relentless fight for friendship, without any of the lessons of letting go. This is a show about growing up, without any of the normalcy of adulthood. This is a character driven show, following people who worry less about what the world has to say, and more what it has to offer only to never take it up on its offerings, resulting in never changing, never growing. I want to say this show made me realize the value of fighting for what's right. But it didn't. I learned nothing about myself or other people or even death in this show. But I did learn this. I learned that not all art is perfect. Not all stories are flawless. But anything that makes a thirteen year old kid get out of a bad mood once a week, forgetting about school, bullies and raging hormones is good enough to exist. It's good enough to stand by. It's good enough to say thank you. For being there when nothing else was.",7,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_14bd628e5a,19
"So I found some time to do my first review over one of my favorite long run anime. That anime is know as bleach. Bleach is an anime about a teen who is delinquent minded at the same time sweet minded, who saw ghosts ever since he was born. This attracted many evil spirits a other spirits towards him as the show progressed. He meets this soul reaper named rukia that hands down shinigami powers to him. Now everyone that sees my review should know what I mean by shinigami. He is soon met by his friends who aid him in battle as they learn about hollow origin and other key points to what threatens the world and They protect innocent souls from these evil spirits called hollows. I rated 6 for the plot of the story as fair, and the term fair, meaning I didn't necessarily dislike or like what it gave to the plate. I still have understood and misunderstood concepts within it. The story in other terms is still something that interests me even though I loved it better as a kid, it's done in anime alot, giving that term fair for being kinda dull on one edge and sharp on the other. 10 goes to art style and concept of art. Im not looking down on 2000 anime when I say this, but for bleach to be out during 2004 it's art style was good for a 2000 anime, meaning yes, it still is a masterpiece for the way it has altered to the modern world. As it progresses to 2012, it's the most appreciated art I have seen, and this can also be followed in the hueco mundo arc. 10 goes to sound cause why not. No matter the environment the protagonists find themselves in, it is well adapted to the tone of sound and music, which makes it all the more acceptable for any fight really. I mean when I say that let's put aside the uninteresting filler that bleach offers. The soul society arc is introduced with rock music, the hueco mundo arc was introduced with a mexican chime, and we find the karakura town arc to have a save the world sound effect that opens up to what the characters are trying to accomplish during their parts. Character gets a 7. I mean the character development has an acceptable rate to get a rating term, good because they at least manages with most of the cast. There are alot of characters they also don't really mess with all that much like halibel, wanting to save her lieutenants from death, and the only connection I saw was the connection in the flashback, which wasn't enough. I mean, it's not like anyone ever pays that much attention to the bad guys, but it's a what evs. The characters motivations are not the most uninteresting thing you'll ever see especially with ichigo wanting to protect loved ones, but realizing what he is up against may show what strength he has to obtain, and what strength he has to lose, which was a good part pf character in the karakura arc. My enjoyment is a 9. Now don't get me wrong when I say the fighting is great , thinking that I find that the most appealing in anime because I don't. What I found most enjoyable in this anime was resolve, sound, and art style. Resolve is in the character section so it's rounded to a 9. I mean I'd pay to see the true last season of bleach, because of how stupid I found the pv 7 for saying ""final season"" is like saying that we put a filler arc as the last season, probably why most people shit on it and say it went way down hill or it could just be me. Yes, it did go downhill but there have been other arcs that made bleach out stand in many ways. Overall, 8. Bleach has gave very good understanding of what appeals in anime the best and at the same time tripping over a few things, it was worth my time tbh and No matter what anyone says I think that everyone should try it out, no matter how they think of it. Well that's all folks and be reminded to never get mad at opinions, but also upraise your opinion with both logical and not logical ways in order to make your point stand out.

"For me, after the first episode hooked me I didn't really start enjoying the series until about episode 15 when the story arc really begins to pick up. I'm a fan of the two lead characters Rukia and Ichigo which made the interval bearable but once it took off - WOW - I couldn't stop watching! Note that after I began watching I started also to read the manga so my review is biased in the fact that I read the manga as well. Artwork across the series is a mixed bag; filler arcs I found some good some really boring; sound, especially the OP and ED were all outstanding except for one in ~50 (which is really amazing!); characters - to me this is one place where Bleach really does a great job in having a huge cast of characters that you grow to love (even some of the ""bad guys"") and all of them are different and unique. Character growth is limited and mainly only the growth of their powers. Depth of the story is not too deep, someone will usually mouth off or say something that breaks the tension at the more emotional moments. Overall, I really enjoyed this series as I enjoy a light, action packed, sometimes humorous, story with great music, good to excellent art, and engaging characters that I can root for. I hope that once the manga is finished that the studio will also animate the final arc.",8,Recommended,"Apr 30, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a98d09a24d,19
"Bleach is a popular anime that means it is known by many not that everyone loves it or any thing. No there are many people saying it should end well I do not believe is should. Well the story begins with the protagonist Ichigo with ability to see ghost then he gains powers due to an encounter with a shimigami that’s when the story begin about his adventure of trying to protect everyone he holds dear. Now I am a fan now I did look in to why some people dislike this anime well I will try to work those reasons in this NOT review. Now lets begin first thing I notice is people saying that there is no story line or no straight track with that said. Here is my response the story line in Bleach is Ichigo's resolve to protect things around him while others(enemy) trying to disrupt the peace. Another thing the story line goes to new arcs/filler arc to show you the soul society's past or present that you would have not known before. Next problem was they said the main character has ridicules power ups. Now my response is with more power the power takes on new form just like someone trying to gain muscles body would change or someone trying to gain power would gain weapons(form of power). No character development was the next problem people faced with the show. Now I do not believe this to be true we learn many things about the characters past, friends, and how/why they fight. Next we have the problem of same thing happens their example was first it was Rukia being saves then it was Orihime being saved. What was my first response because yes people similarities were there but each one was taken for their own reason Rukia be taken and sentence to death was because she gave her powers to a human. The reason Orihime was taken because Aizen though her power would be useful to him that and he did not want that power on the soul reapers side. Next problem people faced were that there were the pacing of fights with no strategy and fight all happen the same way their example being good guy wins or good guy gets help and wins. Of course the good guy side won there was so much at stake that they would obviously have people help them win. For example of that would be during the arrancar arc where first Chad then Nell then an injured Ichigo were all defeated before Zaraki, Kenpachi came to defeat the arracar. For the no strategy there were strategy mainly who would fight who, or where the people would be position at. They would have their meetings all the time in the show where they would talk about strategies if you were not so arrogant to pay attention you would have notice that. There were few who cares about that the other questions were painfully obvious if you were to pay the slightest attention you would understand why now an example of these stupid reasons they dislike the show was bad dialogue with the example(""your sword will never cut me""). Now besides I only saw this arrogant or crazy people say this in the show one was Aizen(arrogant), and during the fight I sated above between Zaraki and the espada where both of their bodies were difficult to cut so yea the boasted that the other could never cut themselves. So yea their dialogue being about their day to-day Life was unlikely to come up in a sword fight.",10,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45e806cff4,19
"Probably the greatest action anime in existence. The story has SOME flaws and the scenes aren´t always perfect, but when it matters most, bleach tends to rip me off my chair in excitement. It manages to make some scenes so epic that I just can´t wait for the continuation of the anime that has been dead for a while now, but is said to show itself again sometime soon. What was also very outstanding of course is how powerful the characters are in bleach, the strongest of them: The main character, Ichigo Kurosaki, one of my favorite protagonists of all time. Yes, I will admit that I am a fanboy of this anime, but bleach is still definitely one of the top ones out there.

"Bleach was the anime that every person knew about or watched way back in the 2000’s and understood most of the references to. If you haven’t heard of bleach, do you even watch anime at all? (Some spoilers ahead) Ok. But seriously, Bleach has a really strong beginning and the animation and art was nothing short of ahead of its time when I look back and think about it. The first few episodes were touching and I remember tearing up a little at the chad and parakeet episode. I love the concept of the soul society and the Gotei 13 (or as the dub called it, the 13 court guard squads lol) Also, you had to admit, no anime has ever came close to bleach when it comes to the aesthetics, it’s very prominent and unforgettable. (The title cards are appealing as hell) It had such great potential when I started watching and I never tore my eyes off of any episode for even a second, always wondering what would happen next and how will the plot progress and wondering how the characters will grow into their own? The answer is that they don’t. Not at all. Not even the main character Ichigo, even though it seems that Tite Kubo tried his hardest to put all of his brain cells to work to make Ichigo a good/interesting MC. It just never happened, unfortunately. But I give the series the benefit of the doubt, Kubo probably didn’t plan too much about character relationships or understand much about the complexity of it to really write anything to begin with. The series ended up adopting the go to shounen formula (1. main character gets powers, 2. fights enemies, 3. meets main antagonist of the arc, 4. trains some more, 5. gets a power up, 6. Beats the bad guy, and it starts over from step 2) But, bleach gets all of the same criticism that I just listed above. And it gets rather annoying that people tend to use this to point at the series and say that it’s overrated. For all of its faults and horrible female characterization, bleach does have its heart set in the right place, I feel. I really felt that there was a time that bleach was heading into the direction of human morality and maybe something deeper, for example, what was in the chimera ant arc of hunter x hunter. But then, nothing happened. Bleach was really ass-pulling power levels and flashy powers where characters have time to monologue and chat like they were discussing the weather over some coffee. And it really pulls the series down and make the culmination of everything that has happened in previous arcs vanish. There was nothing memorable in the cast either, I can’t remember most of the Gotei 13 except for the attractive characters or the ones that get the most screen-time. Ultimately, I have no qualms with people who speaks highly about bleach, because I do think that some of the characters have great potential, and I really do like the main cast sometimes, mainly Rukia and Ichigo. And it’s such a damn shame, because I honestly wished Kubo would’ve grabbed at the chances that were dangling right in front of him, and I’m far from an expert writing critic, but even I could see the exact parts where the series just completely wasted everything. But I did enjoy the series while it lasted, even if it was mainly due to my attachment towards a few of the characters. Overall, it was a 6/10.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 30, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d2d6e953d8,19
"What can I say about Bleach? Oh, I know. IT'S AWSOME. The anime is always action-pact, and there is hardly any dull moments. I also like the fact that even the fillers in this anime are great. They give you full arcs, instead of a few couple hundred episodes with no sense (you know what I'm refering to). Lastly, I kinda like the love triangle between Ichigo, Rukia and Orihime.

"One thing I have learned from Bleach is that just because something is popular does not make it good (the recent US Presidential election taught us that). It is far better to judge something on your own than be swayed by the masses. STORY: 3/10 Bleach follows every single cliche you can think of, and then some more that you perhaps didn't think of. It's forgiving when you think that the show has gone on for a whopping 366 episodes, however it's less so when you're actually watching it. Much of the good moments come from the villain's own story rather than the hero's. Though the kido spells are a nice touch (hence my username), there isn't much that makes it stand out - typical wham/bam affair. The only thing unique about this area is the layering of filler arcs and episodes, which are actually more entertaining than the canon ones. ART: 6/10 Bleach follows a standard drawing template and color in affair. The funny moments get downgraded to frowns and chibi expressions for effect, but the normal ones are a pretty average affair. The characters seem typical of your early 00s anime: glimmering eyes, funky hairstyles and uniforms that seem quite difficult to move in, let alone fight in. The backgrounds are pretty much the same too, with the haunting exception of Hueco Mundo at night. Again, standard stuff. SOUND: 4/10 There is a possibility, albeit a small one, that if I watched the subbed version instead of the dubbed, I'd like this show better. Like the show itself, much of the good voicework comes from the supporting characters rather than the main ones. Johnny Young Bosch's cool drawl does little to dim Ichigo's arrogance and Michelle Ruff is almost always monotone for Rukia except the occasional scene. Special mention to Kate Higgins (Unohana, Nanao and Lillynette), Karen Strassman (Momo and Soi Fon) and Megan Hollingshead (Rangiku and Nemu) who portray quite a range of vocals here with the limited script. Special mention also goes to the soundtrack 'On The Precipice of Defeat' for being awesome at the right moments when the good guys turn the tide of battle. CHARACTER: 1/10 If a show has to rely on a large variety of characters to pull it through, then it is not a good show. Bleach has an entire airport full of characters that they can focus on, but none are given the attention they deserve. The filler episodes really bring out what could have been done had the supporting characters had more screentime, but the main arcs remind you of the central team ad nauseum. I can forgive overly arrogant characters like Kenpachi, Toshiro, Byakuya, Yamamoto and even most of the hollows in favor of more fleshed out ones like Momo, Kisuke, Yoruichi and Aizen; however one thing I cannot overlook is the main character Ichigo. The boy seems to be in love with his brooding antihero archetype and sadly much of the development of his character has gone into his powers (which are constantly pulled out of nowhere) rather than his personality. There is nothing relatable about these characters, they are as flat as the pages of the manga they came from. ENJOYMENT: 4/10 It is hard to watch Bleach - there I said it. I often found myself skipping episodes and enjoying the filler stuff more than the main story. On paper, this sounds like a good show, but watching it is a different story altogether. I will watch certain episodes as guilty pleasures, but to go through the show again is... let's just leave it at that. OVERALL: 3/10 Though it does have moments where it shines, Bleach does not make for good watching if you need something deep to draw you in. Watch it for the big fight scenes, watch it for the fact that heroes get to be heroes - heck, even watch it for the fanservice sometimes, but don't watch it if you want good anime.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 13, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d8be409163,19
"BLEACCHH!!! ahh... where to start?... STORY: to me has held itself up alright for a good while now, every now and then i watch an episode and find (little) interest towards anything that's going on unless it involved a decent fight scene or finally seeing aizen or gin or whatever their names are. i feel that... it's something of interest, but not too much. i'm not going to say it's worth watching 30 eps of filler to finally see the scene you wish to witness, all i do is watch the good moments of the story, (skip like 20 episodes and get to the good part), i suggest it to you too so you and i don't kill ourselves over absoloute boredom of the characters doing things and talking about rubbish that doesn't entertain anyone. ART:as soon as i witnessed bleach it was easily compaired to already witnessed anime and had beat them all. aka dbz, naruto n such. 'there is definatly higher quality anime then bleach, but i never focus on bleaches quality of art in a negative way, i like the character modeling they look like real people more so than most anime characters. nowadays it's quite avarage quality for an anime in detail. but it's good. SOUND:ahhh!!! so good! lol it's like the main reason why i enjoy it! the fight scenes of the earliest episodes of the show had such epic battle music, it still does! well i feel like they milked the music to early and yeah later on the new music doesn't sound so epic because the beggining music was quite powerful. still i have some of the music on my itunes for writing inspiration, good stuff, get's you into the mood. CHARACTER:well... characters... they could be alot better, not much interest of mine goes into the characters they are rather boring, although some characters like- grimjaw and uluqiora, they were the most memorable characters and they like die, i was thinking grimjaw would be in it for longer, -I wanted him in it for longer-. bad fan service, he was such a character, oh and same for uluqiora, but maybe i would have ended up hating them eventually, they died being loved i guess, some characters aren't interesting and original, some you want to hold onto a little longer. ENJOYMENT:I... enjoy bleach sometimes, i don't usually watch it, but if i know there is a important part happening, i will be told by my friend and i will watch it, aka cool fight scene aizen appears blah blah. it all seems a little repetetive at times. it was boring as hell at many points milking the same story except having the characters memory erased and stuff... bounto... stupid stuff... ádd more interesting things bleach creators!, i know fans will stick by it, (the show) that is, well i beleive you are loosing their interest slowly there are many that will stick with the show to the end, but for god sake give us more enjoyment, even though your show is alright... every now and then.

"Bleach, being one of the three popular anime's from Shonen Jump, has a reason for being so popular. The main plot of the anime is rather good and it is thought out which is why I give it a higher score, however the characters, side stories, longevity, the ending of the main arc and predictability are what bring the anime down. I am not saying the characters are ""lame"" or lax, I am simply saying that instead of throwing in random side arcs to prolong the series, perhaps they should work on the character development and a solid conclusion. This would bring the anime a much higher score from me, and I am sure from other fans. There are memorable characters however, this is no doubt. This is the one thing Bleach does have. The characters may not be well developed, but they are definitely memorable in the sense that everyone can relate in some way to one or more character's personalities (as limited as they are) or situations. I would recommend that you skip the side arcs. The Bounts, Zanpaktu side arc, and Shusuke Amagai side arc. The only worth while side arc you should watch would be the back in time pieces about how the Seretei was organized before the current group of captains. Very interesting.

"Bleach the anime, put simply, is to the manga what batman forever is to batman. it tries to get the tone but misses due to some unknown reason. bleach is essentially the action version of loony toons. by which i mean its more about talking and creating atmosphere and tension witthin powerful, bursts of combat. sadly what really makes it sad how it turned out is that not only did kubo work on the anime as well, but that it seems that to begin with, the fillers (ie the bount arc and the zanpakuto arc) are on par in every way to the manga to the point that they overshadow the main story. but then they become cookie cuts of other arcs, and it hurts that the good ones have little to no baring to the plot. However for all it's flaws, i have three words to say BLEACH OST IS BADASS. it is beautiful, in fact i can argue, as a musician, that the tracks ""never meant to belong"" and ""morning remembrance"" are on par with pachelbel's canon and the protagonist theme ""number one"" is badass. and the best part is that they sample EVERY style of music out there, from the jpop openings, to gospel ""number one"", to the operas ""invasion"" and ""stand up"" to the surreal ""nothing can be explained"" to number one's metal revamp ""chokaku""lood the animation cut, no corners and allows for some great fights especially after the tedious dialogues which get taxing fast, then you get some fast paced nonstop bloodshed. characters is my favorite part of any show, i'm a villain actor so i love villains and Bleach has thebest villain i've seen since ever. and whilst many say that the constant onslaught of characters is a negeative, i find it a plus as it give a scence of the protagonists progression as he makes more and more allies, and they all become developed without shunting away the older cast. some even throw you through loops. overall i'd have to say it's an enjoyable anime, but if you are going to watch it either steer clear of the manga or read it after, especially as the endings are at different points. which once again is overshadowed in the manga. final verdict: stream first for a taste, buy if you like. and, for the love of god GET THE SOUNDTRACK, it is worth every penny. no every part is under priced. it is a must view for anyone with good taste musically.dramatically, and artistically.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 23, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7d35a1a7bb,20
"For starters, I believe that I should say that I haven't seen Bleach since it's final episode. I watched the entire series up to the final episode, it just has been a while. But the memories I do have of it are fond. And accounting for the entire show it was a great shounen. I don't really believe in giving anything a score because a complex opinion cannot be placed on a value between 1 and 10. But MAL is forcing me to rate it's aspects and it doesn't seem to want to share any of them except for the overall score. So since I am pretty much forced to...here goes. Story 3/10: The worst part of Bleach was its storytelling and flat characters. Bleach's story seems to encompass all that is bad and flawed in the shounen genre. After watching 366 episodes, I cannot tell you a single thing about Ichigo. Other than he loves his friends, which is an observation the anime had to point out to me in the final arc. And that is just the main character. There are loads of characters in this anime, like every other shounen, but almost all of them don't get any screen time. All of them do have their moment, at least once in the show, even if it is only for two or three episodes. So I guess that's good. But we don't go to the shounen genre for it's story telling. We go for it's action! Action 8.7/10 I wanted to give this a nine (9) but I just felt that it didn't deserve it. The action is fast paced and the fights are long and drawn out. Which I like. The fights rarely rely on Deus Ex Machina writing and mostly consisting of Ichigo fighting some enemy while relying on his various transformations (think Dragonball Z). But what's action if it doesn't look cool? Art 7/10: The art is not bad, but it is not good either. The characters are human like and the backgrounds are fine. I don't remember anything out of the ordinary when it comes to the art. The fight scenes look great but the art seems only styled towards fight scenes. So the characters look a little awkward when their standing around and talking. But that is fine since there is not much standing around and talking in this anime. Sound 8/10: The sound is very good. It has it's own urban beat it likes to appropriately play when Ichigo does something cool. But other than the cinematography of the music in relation to the fight scenes it is just a bunch of catchy jpop songs. And nothing to special or unique. Character 4/10: We don't talk about Bleach's characters.... Enjoyment 9/10: I was pleasantly thrilled while watching this anime. It kept me glued to my seat with its fast paced (if somewhat brutal at times) battles. Yes the characters and story are garbage but the fighting and the setting which is the stage for it's fighting is very well done. A lot of people will say that Bleach is the weakest of all of the big three (Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece.) And since I haven't seen One Piece at the time of my writing this, I can't say that Bleach is better than OP. But, after seeing Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, all I can say is...at least Bleach doesn't pretend to have a good story. In my opinion...(perfect flame shield). Overall, I give this anime a 6/10. And the only reason this is so high is because the fight scenes carry it and entire two (2) points.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 17, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9b5c0cea5b,20
"Bleach is definitely one of the more ""mainstream"" of Anime, but it's easily overlooked by the more hardcore of the fanatics, It's overall... Decent; despite the fact that it probably took me 3 years to finish it at a very very very slow pace. After the first 8 seasons its just okay. I had every episode downloaded so it was quick and easy to sort through full seasons, and with that as an option I found myself skipping full seasons that were nothing but filler; and the first several episodes had the worst art (in my opinion) and many other seasons were just slow or yet again riddled with filler episodes. I definitely think its worth a look if you can stand the artwork of the character for the first quite awhile, but it definitely picks up and looks a lot prettier in the end; and the action scenes are always amusing if you can handle all the obvious comments that lots of anime tend to suffer. (ie, pointing out incredibly obvious things to the point where it physically hurts your being.) Give it a shot, either you'll like it, love it, or hate it.",7,Recommended,"Oct 26, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a289ecf513,20
"Bleach is a long running series as you probably already know or will find out soon enough, it also go's down as my gateway anime but not my first, I simply got into anime because of this one. Now before I get started I'm going to get two animes that may come up with this anime, If you have already seen naruto or one piece you may or may not like this anime, it's really iffy, but as for me when I watched this show I kinda never looked at the other two the same way, this show tended to be a bit more mature which was a good thing and then I never watched the other two again (sorry Luffy) but anyway onto the review. Impression the initial story is not actually bad and it has a very good approach to the super natural world the story transpires in however the only thing that I would say was a real hindrance to the show was the filler episodes, actually they didn't only have episodes they had entire story arcs to get in the way of the story but you can look up online which episodes to watch and then you can have a more pure and less frustrating experience because the writing in the initial story isn't half bad however it isn't the greatest either it's simply entertaining which is what it is supposed to be. Characters there are a lot of characters in this show, some you like some you hate and some you can really relate to, but I'm just gonna talk about the main ones. We start out with Ichigo Kurosaki who is your average teenager that can see ghosts and the whole story just goes from there, but ichigo has some of the typical shonen main character traits of having spiky hair, love for his family and friends and his cliche desire to protect everyone, but Ichigo seems to play it off well and actually differently, Ichigo is sort of what I call an already perfect character though perfect isn't the word but he seems to already have developed into the character that we wanted to see some snot nose brat from the beginning of another shonen anime, this is actually his biggest problem he doesn't develop at all, the only thing that really changes is his perspective on the world and his animation quality, but I can admit that it was refreshing not to hear some spiky haired kid yell ""BELIEVE IT!"" or something and despite his flaw of already having matured, I still liked him but he may seem boring to some. next you have Rukia Kuchiki a shinigami from the soul society, there's not much I can say here but she tends to be useful in introducing the world and is the first character you see in bleach but she does help move the plot along for the first 60 or so episodes, over time rukia and ichigo grow closer as they work together but like all anime, it just never happens. then there's orihime who is a regular human until later on that is kind of a ditz and brings in some comedic value but also has a crush on ichigo for which he is completely unaware of and she never really confides to him. Second to last is chad who doesn't really say much and is a giant (compared to the japanese) but like most big people I know he is a rather gentle giant with a good set of morals but unlike most characters with those he has actual reasons to be the way he is and he makes for one of the best written characters of the show. finally there is Uryu who is you typical glasses character, with a grudge and rivalry with ichigo, despite having a similar personality. there are many more characters for which you will see in this anime which will help push the story along some being my personal favorites. Sub vs. Dub It's that time, that time for me to openly accept the dub and be picky as hell with the sub, but this time I can say despite some other opinions I would have to say that the sub and dub seam to be evenly matched however are pretty much the same but I did find both of them entertaining in their own way's. Final verdict about a 7 for this one this is an anime that tends to hold it's self up and can actually be taken a little more seriously than others but it's not the greatest but I could blame the filler for that.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c0c11fd958,20
"First of All, almost everything you have heard about this is probably true. For Bleach is a masterpiece gone mediocre in most ways possible and depending on during which period of anime era and your lifetime you have watched this show will color you in such arrays as to be an analogy to the contrast between feminazis and Trump supporters. My advice - Be calm, be composed and be a centrist like JBP and his cohorts. Here's the best case scenario for you - You haven't watched too many anime or have just got into it or maybe you're low expectancy sorta fella. You are in luck if you are reading this review in 2018 and still match the above criteria, you should start watching the show (and also, WT@f!!). But if you are anything but this, here's how I would recommend going about this: 1) NEVER touch the manga. Kubo may be a Vasto Lorde of Shounen enterprising but he himself and his associates fucked the last third of the manga into a corner that left everyone who was on the reading end with a bad taste in their mouth. Trust me on this, or maybe reddit and google it if you have already come this far in search of the truth, that nothing good ever came on following through with the manga after the anime or even just reading it in general. Almost everything it does, is done better with sounds, animation, musics and VA in the anime (that's what animes are all about; I hope you knew that or maybe I've just spoiled that for you). But alas, if you are the sort that will not accept something to be called preposterously horse-dung unless they have lathered their own tongues with it (Omaewa gross nanoka, ne ?!), be my guest and go ahead with this endeavor knowing and calming your about-to-be-shitfaced heart with this solemn truth that I never read a single page of the manga. EVER. And the world's better off without having to deal with the aftermath of such a traumatic incident. 2) Check out anime filler info websites about the anime, which does boast a spectacular target of 45% BS material that have nothing whatsoever to do with the canon (The producers of the show must have been creaming themselves for the sheer opportunity they got to try their hands at creative writing; Newsflash asswipes, every single one of majored in with flying colors at shit-handling). However if you are the sort with a lot of time, OCD or a general lack of aim in life (maybe a little interested in masochistic self-indulgences), take note of the episodes with Kon and Karakuraizer stuff and when Gotei 13 join, well it's riot... of shit-fests. Kanpai! 3) Always, and I insist ALWAYS, keep the wikipedia pages on list of seasons and episodes bookmarked and close by when you start with the show. The sheer of repetitive content and unnecessary content in this show is absolutely mind-boggling. Most of us are all about spoilers and really into making a deal about knowing things beforehand for it takes the fun out of it things - this is one place where even the creator himself wished he were into astrology. At least he would have some chance of knowing about the pile of shit-storms he had brewed that had taken a life of their own. Also, to be fair, Burichi anime is where the fun begins after you spoil things so that you can still make some efficient choices about the hours and hours of your precious time that 'must' be given to this quasi-faeces obfuscation of logic. Once you have those list nearby and have knowledge of the summary of the episodes you are to watch, you'll able to skim to and finally watch the good stuff (more often than not, you'll have the liberty to skip full episodes). This show really is a bit like swimming in a muddy pond to get to a handful of lotuses that have been sprinkled sparsely to give some meaning to your choices in watching it. And don't fret about missing that one or two cool stuff that should happen in an otherwise 23 minute garbage gunk; you'll mostly end up seeing those scenes in a heartwarming 5 minute recap at the beginning of the next episode or helpful reminiscence of wherever anybody refers to that incident for even half a second, in half-finished sentences. 3) Continuing from the last point, Bleach has similarities with Naruto. Obviously they part of the Big 3 of shounen and bigshots in anime in general. They have both very liberal policies when it comes to recaps to of past scenarios (You will know the Lord above truly loves you in those moments when you'll see that can fast forward and/or skip those scenes altogether) and they are both really into crappy dialogues that made melodramatic and meaningful but are reality, obsolete, redundant crap that are said too loudly taking in consideration its audience who are retarded in mental nature (I mean, what choice and position do we have to oppose that assumption having watched this show). And the power-ups and creative choices of the people involved in dealing with boss fights and their formulations. I have a theory: Either Tite Kubo was replaced by a ghostwriter write after he had permission for SJW for publishing it or he is the typecast sort who really has limitations doing things for story beyond creating sweet character designs, interconnections and amazing BGM suggestions (These are the things nobody can ever take away from show; and this is also a summary of why it's failed work of genius). Thankfully, Naruto had so much more in terms engaging and exciting in terms of story, lore, shounen, characters and progression until its last 50 chapters came about. But that's another story and we'll respectfully let it all slide for it gave the world ITACHI UCHIHA!!! 4) Nothing will ever get you accustomed to every shithead in the show having to each other's ful names again and again and again. I mean, have some faith on the readers remembering the names, or using a wiki or not caring at all when characters keep popping out of the woodwork left and right - most of them have mediocre stories and motivations that are obvious and non-engaging which is still fine because one cannot help but appreciate how this many different characters who mostly are damn cool in design keep coming from the same mind who brought about atrocious obstacles to peace - namely, Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue (Petty names, Petty Stories, Petty existence, Good powers wasted with weak reason on why they even have it all). 5) Ichigo is the lucky lottery winner. Remember that and it will make everything else easier. He will always and has always been everything and will eventually get everything that is necessary for him to overcome his troubles, in his words, ""because he has to"". At least, he is far from an annoying shounen MC who is always more talk and speeches except for the part his character design (and also that of every other character in this manga and of any other manga of this sort at the time it was being written) is to keep repeating people's names instead of genuine words and getting all up in everybody's business. But it is his story and he very much lively irrespective of which time period you're watching. And there's Isshin's Shinigami OP backstory - I can't get into it. If you're a hardened explorer, you will do what you want. 6) Any sane person would have Rukia the main character of this story and Gotei 13 more exposure in the story. Not only in his VA amazing but out of all cringy and over-the-top funny bits in the show, the ones with most chances of making you laugh will almost always include Rukia - her voice. words and chibi design totally are made for it. And Gotei 13 in its entirety and its interwoven links with each other make for such an interesting pursuit in the story make things real interesting. The funny part is Gotei 13 is part of the main cast and appear in parts or whole in major sub-plot and basic plot progression in general. Despite that, the show manages to shove its head up its butt. That's just fate is all and you on the threshold must decide whether you choose to be involved in the shit-spattering that is collateral to being successful in the achievement of being able to pull someone that big-headed out of their arse. It's a riot if nothing else, pros and cons churning over the buckets. 7) Lastly, this point will sum things up by reiterating something previously notified - this show is very callous in how it uses its power ups, its successes and failures. To give you some perspective almost every power used in the show, whether it be a KIDO, SHIKAI or obviously BANKAI, everything causes humongous explosions that dwarf their battlefield and fighters. There is nothing wrong about doing so as it provides a spectacle, a hype opportunity and an excellent chance at animation but what it does end up doing is it devalues all the hard work of that power up when nobody really gets caught in it, because there is one-upper to make a sensational battle manga moment and if by chance they do get caught in it, they are healed, helped and recovered surely. Shounen in general have an aversion to killing characters, partially because continuity is important to serialization, partly because young audiences and sometimes the author isn't just willing to part with his design that he favors (the last one is what ODA said about the One Piece and its death issues; that is one weak point of the world's best shounen manga and it makes up for it by doing better in other places). But life can only shown to be meaningful and worthy of fighting for when you impress upon people how quick and cruel death's embrace really is. For a show that has a radical like Kaname Tosen who willing accept rigid dichotomies of good and bad, it sure is an eyesore to see only the bad guys dying out in defeat and the good guys always living till sunset and rising anew in the next sunrise. A few important character come through death in flashbacks but it's no Bellemere being shot by Arlong or Minato and Kushina's sacrifice for their son and Konoha. It doesn;t leave you aching or even too bothered and that's Kubo's limitation as a writer. All in all, you are patient one if you read through all that and me praising your temperament is your probable reward out of this. If I left an image that I am pissed at the show or its work, it is only in that I have seen anything as imperfect and incomplete. It is not anger but pity which I truly feel for it all. And I still will take my hat off to Kubo if I ever meet him for sheer work he put in to create the world. The harsh truth is Bleach will always be third in every person's shounen olympics and not even even qualify for the pre-heats in the overall list for most anime watchers. That's is just how it's story goes. P.S - If somehow I got you convinced out of watching this show and you are certainly unwilling to utilize it to better your life in some productive way other than going into the world of Manga and Anime and nearby stuff, you are advised to read One Piece obviously. Also, consider Ishida Sui's Tokyo Ghoul series and the most underrated manga I have ever read, which is Vinland Saga.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 1, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8078810011,20
"Strap yourselves in for an honest review of Bleach! One of the nostalgic anime classified among “The Big Three of Shonen”. Many of us (me included) might have watched Bleach at some point when we were young and it may have influenced us and our anime tastes just as much as it influenced the industry of Shonen anime to come. But from a more critical eye, does it have some worth beyond just nostalgia? Story: 4.88 / 10 Unfortunately, Bleach fell into two big traps. First, it didn’t know when to end. Second, it couldn’t deliver on its climax. Both of these problems come from the manga, so it isn’t strictly the adaptation’s fault. As for the first point, after the first big arc (which was pretty great), it becomes clear that filler arcs would just be plugged in to make up time and nothing would happen of consequence to the main story set up in the first arc for hundreds of episodes. Now, I didn’t personally mind most of the filler arcs, I think some of them had great ideas and I enjoyed the stories. However, the placement of these filler arcs was terrible. A 15-episode filler arc would begin in the middle of a climactic battle or event and that is unacceptable. Not knowing to end after the first great arc and plugging the rest with horribly timed filler was an annoyance. The second point was Bleach’s nail in the coffin for me. The big climactic arc that was built up to ever since the end of the first arc was horribly handled. None of the villains that were built up to be massive threats were threatening at all and instead of stepping up the stakes and using interesting team-ups and techniques to overcome the threats, they just ruin their powerscaling entirely and retread the same tropes as before. The way they ruined this important arc literally made me want to drop the series the first time I watched it in entirety. Art: 5.42 / 10 Being from the early 2000’s, the animation isn’t amazing to begin with, but gets the action done well enough. Fortunately, thanks to the length of the series, the animation became better as it went on and by the end it looked pretty good. Altogether, I’d say it looks above average; never terrible enough to want to claw my eyes out and never great enough for me to rewatch a scene purely for the visual spectacle. Sound: 7.22 / 10 The soundtrack is a little repetitive, but the tracks that they use are memorable and fit the tone, with some great theme music for the protagonist and good usage of the more ominous tracks when introducing villains. The openings are of a generally high quality, given how many there are, and even the ending songs were pretty good overall. The voices are also pretty good, for both the subbed and dubbed versions, with some characters standing out more than others. The soundtracks and songs might be the aspect of Bleach that I have the most nostalgia for because of how memorable it is. Character: 7.73 / 10 Bleach has a wide variety of characters. The upside to running for more than 300 episodes is that there is a lot of time to spend with interesting characters to learn more about each one of them. The powers are also very interesting and unique. Watching so many characters with complete backstories and interesting abilities interact – be it in combat or not – was fun. Bleach is also the origin of many of the coolest anime character names I know of. Enjoyment: 6.14 / 10 Nostalgia aside, I’m not crazy about Bleach. Every badly placed filler arc prompted me to stop watching for a few weeks and after the big climactic arc, I was so insulted that I stopped watching for 4 months before I picked it up again and finished the last 50 episodes. Don’t get me wrong, there were enjoyable aspects – like I mentioned – but overall, I can’t say that Bleach was very enjoyable. I appreciate the fact that I watched it, but not much more than that. Overall: 6.28 / 10 Truthfully, if the climax arc was done well, Bleach could have been above a 7 out of 10. With the climax as it is and with the badly placed filler, I can’t help but feel generous in giving Bleach this score. I can understand that some people love Bleach, be it for nostalgic reasons or because they just liked the cool fights regardless of the stakes or scaling, but unfortunately, this is as far as I am willing to go for Bleach.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7ab88d775d,20
"No spoilers I was recommended Bleach by a Friend. He said it was awesome and underrated. After much pursuing, i finally agreed to watch it. The more i watched it the more i didn't want to. But I can't break the heart of my friend. Story- 5 Bleach's starting is good. With having a typical Shonen Jump story, it's first few arcs were done good. After the Soul City or whatever it's name was it becomes a drag. Too much filler. The following arcs seem unnecessary and boring. It's Like Tite Kubo( The author of Bleach) is being forced to write anything that comes into his mind. Art- 3 The Animation by Pierrot is the worst. Naruto's animation was not any good either. The first 100 episodes of one piece have better animation then this. The animation is not in flow as i expected. The manga art is better. Sound- 4 While the songs are not bad, they are not good either. The score is annoying. What's with the Background music??!! Starting at scenes when it's not needed. Character- 4 The MC Ichigo does not have any experience in sword fighting, but defeats people stronger than him. He has an obvious plot armor. The villain Aizan is decent, but i didn't understand his motives. All the other characters are forgettable. Enjoyment- 3 No enjoyment. Think of a thing you enjoy to do. Now think the opposite. That is Bleach for me. I gave it three, because i only liked till the soul society arc. Overall- 4 Overall Bleach is an anime you can live without watching. My advise- Don't watch it.",4,Not Recommended,"Jul 29, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4bdb79faad,20
"*No Spoilers* Summary: This is a show that's very popular and for good reason: It starts off with an interesting plot and characters. The problem is that everything in the story is a cycle. The main character doesn't make any significant choices, the character development is abysmal, the power system is inconsistent, and it's basically just a formulaic plot-line in which the character magically gains powers, predominantly through unknown means, to overcome antagonists who are completely stronger than him. And then, those foes decide that instead of dying or seeking revenge, they join him in his quest to...... no one really knows. The main character doesn't have consistent goals after the first part of the story unravels, and that leaves this as a 90% plot-driven story with 10% character-driven story with stagnant characters. The anime is based off of the Bleach manga, which is a better use of your time than the anime. This anime review does not include comparisons between the manga and anime. Story: 4/10 (excluding the endless fillers) The story is quite captivating and unique at first. As the protagonist explores a new type of world, we see some interesting world-building. After that, the plot falls apart. There are a ton of fillers (more than any other anime, as of 2022) that add nothing to the main plot, and even the canon plot is formulaic. In fact, some of the fillers are more captivating than the canon episodes because, either way, there’s no clear aim of the plot through the eyes of the protagonist. Ichigo doesn't make important decisions, he just talks about being stronger and then some unexplained ability is made available to him and he obliterates an antagonist that decimated him at the beginning of the arc. Characters don't work together, they also formulaically split up for one-on-one fights. None of the main characters die, it's unrealistic, and the plot twist towards the end is ridiculous. Because it is so plot-driven, we don't really get to know what is important to Ichigo, and we don't care after the first few arcs. Ultimately, the story started great with a unique world and premise, but it fell apart once it started using a formula to ""force"" Ichigo to win fights and focused on the plot over the characters. Art: 7/10 The art style is interesting and works well for the setting. Some episodes have lacking quality, and the fight scenes are sometimes just a few frames repeating to show Ichigo magically overpowering his enemy. As with most anime, the art quality was inconsistent, but it worked nicely for the show's concept. Sound: 8/10 Shiro Sigisu did an excellent job with the music. The voice acting is poor, and some voices are just whiny for no reason. The music is one of the best aspects of this show, so I weighed that quite heavily for this sound section. Character: 1/10 This is a show in which most characters are useless, annoying, don't contribute to the plot in a meaningful way, don't make any important decisions, and allow the plot to fling them around like a juggling ball. As aforementioned, this is a plot-driven story, and the characters don't develop. The worst part is that we know nothing about the main character or his thoughts/feelings. He is thrown into a unique situation, but they don't talk about that. Instead, he just does whatever he wants, is almost killed but can't die due to some magical ability that isn't explained until the end (and very poorly at that). Ichigo's friends are mainly annoying, they don’t develop in a meaningful way, their powers make them useless most of the time, and there's a weird rivalry that’s vaguely explained but inconsistently portrayed between the main character and his “friend.” Even the characters that you are initially intrigued by and care about are so flat and pointless that they don't matter. Basically, the main character is just going to win no matter what, you don't know why, and that's how it goes until the end. Enjoyment: 2/10 This show was interesting and captivating at first, but it completely fell apart once it focused 90% on the plot, started its formulaic battle/decision/power system, and spent 10% of the time poorly trying to develop the characters that started off somewhat intriguing. Overall: 4/10 This is a show that's very popular and for good reason: It starts off with an interesting plot and characters. The problem is that everything in the story is a cycle. The main character doesn't make any significant choices, the character development is abysmal, the power system is inconsistent, and it's basically just a formulaic plot line in which the character magically gains powers, predominantly through unknown means, to overcome antagonists who are completely stronger than him. And then, those foes decide that instead of dying or seeking revenge, they join him in his quest to...... no one really knows. There are plenty of anime in which this happens, but the watcher knows enough about the characters' interests, development, skills, abilities, training, and abilities to keep them understanding what is going on. The main character doesn't have consistent goals after the first part of the story unravels, and that leaves this as a 90% plot-driven story with 10% character-driven story with stagnant characters. This could have been an excellent show with memorable characters, story, visuals, and music; instead, it fell apart and never recovered.",4,Not Recommended,"May 7, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d4a15cdb88,20
"Bleach is a good anime. However, being a major shonen anime, it has a lot of spoiler arcs to fill time until the manga gets a bit ahead. The main arcs are all quite good, but the filler, for the most part, are sub-par. ------ The characters in Bleach are extremely one dimensional. There's little to no true character development for anyone, and most pretty cookie cutter. Overall, Bleach is a decent anime. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece and you'll like it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 23, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_48f1cecad6,20
"A friend had asked me to check out Bleach and so I did, knowing that is was the first long running anime he got into and knowing that I had already watch far more anime than him - hence more exposure to the anime world that him. I decided to watch in but tread carefully and be a little more open than I otherwise would have toward a long running anime. In the beginning it got good and I was interested, but not too interested. All was going well 'til I hit a filler arc that was so long and dragged out that I got bored and wanted to stop, but I didn't, hoping that once i was over it, and it resumed with the canon story, it would get better. After the painful-to-watch-without-cringing-arc about Bounts, it got interesting again and then i got back into it and started to watch more often. This cycle continued for the next filler arc. Right now I'm at a point where I'm about to watch a really long filler arc and I know it will kill my interest in the series but I don't want to skip anything because I like to see things through. Bottom line is, the series is good. BUT! All those filler ruin everything and kills whatever moment is built as the actual canon story-line progresses. With Bleach my interest is like an on-and-off relationship. Sometimes I really like it, sometimes it tests my patience and I don't. The story altogether so far is OK. I have yet to be amazed by some plot twist which I am hoping there will at least be. Watch this only if you have nothing else better to watch or if you are a kid (who doesn't know better about anime), OR if you are into typical shounen battle anime. The way I'm writing this is makes it seem like it sucks royally, but it really doesn't. It's entertaining, but I still feel like it's not good enough for me. Hope you enjoy it more than I do. It's 350+ episodes. Good luck on your journey with Ichigo Kurosaki if you decide to go through with it. The next time I come back here is because I have finished watching the entire series.",7,Recommended,"Nov 17, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_55d7a71499,20
"Skip all the fillers and it's okay, despite all the nonsense happening in the show. The soundtracks are amazing too. Some problems with Bleach is the fact that characters only appear once and they will no longer appear in the future. The concept of Hell was never explored until the movie and there isa lot of plot holes. The mechanics of the Bleach universe is very inconsistent. I recommend watching this anime for some brainless fun. The fight scenes are amazing but that's about the only thing you'll get from Bleach. If you want to see a better shounen Hunter x Hunter is what I recommend.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_25c280c9fb,20
"I'm going to try write this somewhat brief review, for a very vast series. If it's too long, read my tl;dr at the bottom of the review. Nope. Nevermind, can't make it brief. Too much to say. Coming from someone like me who is extremely inattentive when it comes to longer series of anime, this one far surpassed my usual ""60-episode limit"" that I impose upon myself normally. Nonetheless, I finished it. I was nothing short of impressed that I managed to stick through the whole series. The first thing I would like to address is the good parts of the anime (No spoilers, just what I liked about it personally.) - - Epic, lengthy storyline: For those who love a grand and epic story, Bleach will most likely not disappoint you. It's long, and interesting, and fun! - - Good artwork, and a great soundtrack!: I absolutely loved the soundtrack for the anime, more than I even liked the anime itself. That being said, the artwork and animation in the anime is definitely of good quality! - - Diverse cast of characters!: What I marveled at the most about this series was the immense amount of characters you encounter and/or follow on their prospective journeys. It was truly massive! Now, the bad. Keep in mind however, this is what I personally dislike about it, the things I name may be considered a plus in some viewers' eyes. So this is pretty much just a list of things you can determine to be good or bad. - - Long: I'll be blunt here, the series is LONG. 366 episodes?! Seriously?! Way too much for me, my enjoyment of the series deteriorated due in part to the immense number of episodes. Really not my thing, might be yours though, give it a shot. - - Some lackluster character development: I wasn't very impressed with the development of individual characters in the series, it seemed like the series was swamped with the quandary betwixt quantity and quality. But they chose a larger quantity of characters instead of a higher quality of character development. I didn't get to know and love characters like I have in some of the shorter series I have watched in the past. But that's sort of what happens when you have your story jumping from character to character in the midst, or between episodes. I liked the characters, sure. I just didn't love the characters. Kind of important for me normally. - - Filler episodes: Now, before I get blasted by someone's secret technique for this, let me just say that I absolutely cannot stand filler episodes. I hate them. Some of you like em, sure, they're fun and can be interesting. But throwing up a good 6+ episode arc right when the final showdown between the main character and a powerful adversary was about to unfold? SERIOUSLY?! That's just insulting. I was not pleased with discovering so many strange arcs appearing in the series exactly where I didn't want them to be. If anything, the series should've maybe been 200 episodes long, if you cut out all the filler and all the stuff that felt unnecessary. That's just my two cents though. If you like fillers, you'll probably adore watching through this whole series. - - Techniques became dry: Some of you may not get what this means. But you know how in a fight between two characters, how they fight, and one thinks he has the upper hand, but then he discovers he’s injured and the opponent launches into this lame dialogue about the secret technique they used that the person didn’t expect? Yeah. That garbage is RAMPANT in Bleach. I got so goddamn sick of it by the time I finished the series, I wanted to cry. In small series with few episodes, this isn’t a problem. I’ve seen the tables turn so much. Bleach could’ve been a Pokémon adaptation that involved magikarps using splash attack until one finally evolved into Gyrados and used hyperbeam. The excess of plot twists would have M. Night Shyamalan spinning in circles. This is no big concern for me normally, most anime I’ve watched have plenty of what I just mentioned. However, 366 epidoes full of this stuff is far beyond what I’ve ever wanted to experience as far as plot twists are concerned. tl;dr : So, the good is that it's interesting with a fun story and cool (and numerous) characters. Fun for people who like a long series to immerse themselves in. The bad is that it's friggin' long, has too many filler episodes and arcs, and doesn't leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling with any of the characters except for maybe a very slim few, none of whom are the main character. Frankly, I’m glad the anime is over. For now.",7,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0c174bd515,20
"Honestly if it wasnt my first ever anime i watched as a kid back in like 2010 it would be a 4/10 An early 2000s anime full of sexism and no longer funny jokes and tropes, most of the characters dont make ANY damn sense as real people and only serve as dehumanized tools for the main character to get TSUYOKU but he magically stays so vague and average throughout the entire show honestly the whole cast should just check out and go do their own show and it would be far more interesting than watching ichigo struggle his way out of averageness for nearly 400 episodes and FAIL Art was nice, despite everyone hating the early bleach art i love it, and i love the middle bleach art as well, then the late stuff i never watched so yeah THE STYLE is very fashionable. If bleach got anything it got THE STYLE Openings SLAP!!!

"There’s a reason why bleach is one of the most dropped mainstream anime of all time. Literal snooze fest, if you can even stay awake watching the first 33 episodes you deserve a gold medal and I’m being 100% serious. This is an anime of it’s time (2000’s) and it’s literally unwatchable in the current day. bleach can’t even be compared to One Piece or Naruto, in fact it’s laughable that this is considered one of the big three. Both Naruto and One Piece aged really well in comparison, Save yourself some time and skip this mid. The story is extremely boring and cliche, nothing about this show stuck out to me. Even for something that came out in 2004 the troupes and themes have been done way too many times before. The plot is very reminiscent of a really bad Yu Yu Hakusho fanfiction made into an actual series and milked harder than a cow on an unregulated farm. Not to mention half of this dumpster fire is literally filler that has nothing to do with the actual plot. As for the designs...complete and utter azz. Half the characters look easy to draw and if you change the hair color of my boy ichigo he would look like every other forgotten shonen protag from 2006. I literally have nothing else to add to this review because I already forgot most of what I was watching, it was that unmemorable and boring. This series would’ve went hard if we were in 1996 but in 2023 you would play this to make a baby fall asleep.",1,Not Recommended,"Jul 17, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0c1594d525,20

"Bleach is defenitely part of the big three, I wanted to get that out of the way first, I can defenitely see it has flaws, but there isn't much of a problem if you just skip the fillers, the characters are very likeable and relatable, I recommend Bleach for those who want a simple story which isn't taken over the top, it is very easy to get into and if you go into it with an open mindset then you would be able to enjoy it as much as I did, it is not very complex at all, there aren't any really complex powers in it like say hunter x hunter, there aren't really plot holes in it either, everything can be explained pretty well, it might be unpopular to say but I take Bleach over Naruto and One Piece for the sole reason that I can relate to the characters very well",7,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3c0e622e57,20
"Before you read this review you should probably know that Bleach is my favourite anime so if I am a little bias you know why. First lets get the good out of the way: the characters, story, plot, and adaptation. I absolutely love each and every character in this anime! They all feel so real I suppose you could say; I feel like I've actually bonded with the characters in this show. Even if some of the characters don't have the best writing they are still enjoyable because they show so much emotion that you can't helped but feel attached to them in some way. And don't even get me started on how good of a villain Aizen is, he has it all: the aura, the personality, the intelligence, and so much more! I can't say much else because of, ya know, spoilers, but just know if you have a thing for characters you'll like Bleach. The story for Bleach is actually pretty good. Each arc goes relatively smooth while also introducing new side and support characters perfectly while also progressing the anime at a great pace provided you don't watch filler. The world building isn't the best but it works for the show, it may come of as random bs but the show does eventually explain that and also explains why things are the way they are in the anime. The plot, although not that interesting at first, does actually open up lots of story opportunities for the show, that's really all I have to say that is good for the plot. As an adaptation from the manga I can't that there is much that is bad about it at all really. It has great voice acting for both dub and sub, the animation is great, the music is great, pretty much everything about it is great. But now I must unfortunately say the bad things about this anime. Some of the characters, while still being great, do lack character development. Now this isn't saying those characters bad or don't have any character development, just that they couldv'e had more. The story is amazing but it doesn't have very great flow and it has a tendency to introduce characters and plot points that are completely pointless later on. The story is also completely unpredictable at some points which can leave people confused and or shocked in a not so very good way, then again every show needs some level of unpredictability or else they would be to boring. I have no issues with the plot besides the fact that it doesn't set a clear goal for Ichigo to work towards besides just getting stronger to fight the next opponent tossed his way, but that's more of a preference thing since the anime that I was used to when I first watched bleach had the main character have clear goals that they were constantly working towards. In my opinion Bleach has a brilliant but flawed adaptation, don't get me wrong the adaptation amazing but there were a couple things I didn't like about it. First is the somewhat inconsistent animation where its pretty amazing during fight scenes but during other types of scenes it looks pretty wonky which can kinda ruin Bleach's vibe, secondly is of course the appalling amount of filler. Now I know you can just skip the filler but for people who are new to anime and or don't know what filler is can easily get lost in it. But overall I rate it a 9/10, oh and by the way the anime is absolutely hilarious sometimes so that's another great reason to watch it.",9,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5ba4f72fb4,20
"Early episodes (1-11/12 sort of) are not easy to digest, for a more mature audience, in the sense of the writing and directing. Drawings are nice, animation as well, art style is a bit 'everywhere' but becomes more clear as the show progresses. A lot of unique and interesting, alluring and mesmerizing music tracks. Audio design is decent. Dialogues consist too many explanations about characters' drives and ambitions. Timeline of events, even within a single episode, can cause some discomfort as you try to make sense as to why a specific scene is placed where it is on the timeline. It appears the show is aimed at teenagers (mostly), but the topics the show chooses to tackle seems to suggest otherwise, that the show is geared towards a more mature set of viewers. If watched attentively, a certain degree of chaos in the writing and directing is quite present. Cannot tell if it's deliberate or not. All in all, the show is kind of fun to watch due to it's plot devices, fantasy ideas, the worlds it built and the show self-awareness as so not to take itself too seriously. However, there's some discomfort while watching the show because of its childish approach to script writing and the conveying of more profound ideas (if at all such were intended - or existed in the first place - to be presented). Have fun watching (:",7,Recommended,"Sep 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_11cc27e7a3,20
"Bleach is one of the Shonen Jump ""Big 3"", along with One Piece and Naruto. The concept of Bleach is very interesting, but has been pulled off with mixed feelings, mainly because of Studio Pierrot, the animation studio behind Bleach's anime adaptation. The story starts off slow but introduces you about the world of Bleach and different types of characters such as Soul Reapers, Quincies and Hollows. And the Soul Society arc really makes the story engaging and brings forth some iconic lines that you've probably heard in social media. The anime has A LOT of filler, around 45-50%!? And some of the filler arcs aren't even that good! (*cough cough* Bount arc), as expected from Pierrot, So you'll have to either put up with that while watching, or you can just read the manga, But you'll be missing out on some very good parts of the anime. The animation overall can be a pretty mixed bag. Again, as expected from Studio Pierrot (Before Bleach TYBW). At worst it has some mediocre, even bad looking animation with low frame rates, But it also has some highlights that are exceptionally good looking even to this day. But the soundtrack is very nice, It has lots of music that matches the atmosphere of the situation at play and some songs that really stood out to me that i especially liked was ""Going Home"", ""Number One"" and ""On the precipice of defeat"". I have been bashing Studio Pierrot a lot with this anime adaptation, But keep in mind they made the Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War arcs have really blown my expectations, But this review is about the original. The anime has many shortcomings but overall because of how good the plot and soundtrack is, I say it's a smooth 7/10, You'll have to try it atleast once, Don't judge a book by it's cover.

"Bleach review SPOLIER ALERTS Just finished Bleach today and this is my review. I will mostly compare Bleach to Naruto because it’s the only Big Three that I’ve watched other than Bleach and I don’t find it fair to compare a big anime like Bleach to a new gen anime like Demon Slayer. I’ll get straight to it the ANIME of Bleach is a 8.5/10-9/10 at best. Like I specified I rated the ANIME and don’t start talking about the last arc that will come in 2021 because I didn’t read the manga yet. So please, haters go f*ck yourselves 🤝 Animation : At first the animation of Bleach was lacking. It was good for its time but still when you watch the first episode and you’re used to some great animation well, it disappoint you. But I mean all Big three have lacking animation at first and you can see the growth of the animation as the show evolve. I really liked seeing the animation evolution because in Bleach this evolution is rapidly evolving to a smooth and hyped animation. I’m not saying it was AOT level 💀 but in major fights like Ichigo vs Byakuya or even later in the story when the captains fight Aizen and the Arrancars we could see an upgrade in the quality of the fights and that made them more enjoyable. Design : Surprisingly, even if the animation was lacking at first, I personally really liked the design of a few characters like the design of Ichigo and Zaraki were really good. I don’t know why I like them so much but the “old gen” design really hit me on these two characters. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t say EVERY design are good. I admit that they were tragedy and some men were lost in battle. Just look at my man Renji😭😭😭😭😭 (fortunately they arrange him after the time skip of the last arc, but even there he didn’t get the design that he deserved, R.I.P Renji😭😭). But that aside I personally think that the design were a really good surprise. Like even the swords were really well done. Like when Ichigo and Madarame fought in the Soul Society arc, the design of Madarame’s weapon was good and different. You know it’s small details like that, that makes the anime greater than normal one. Character development : For Bleach, honestly I’m disappointed because the only one who has a real and decent development is Ichigo and maybe Inoue who matured a little in the last animated arc, but even there it took her f*cking 300 episodes💀. I really enjoyed his development and the way he thinks. I don’t say that Ichigo is a philosopher like Nagato or something but he’s way of thinking and the subject that he ask himself about are new and interesting. My deception is truly on character like Renji, Rukia, Chad and Ishida. These guys are every time with Ichigo and they pass by some difficulties but damn they don’t develop any thinking or questioning. Yeah in the last arc (in the anime) you see a little bit of development of them, they got a little bit mature but that’s all. Character like Ulquiorra who’s just here for an arc, have more character development than the principle secondary character. The thing is antagonist like Ulquiorra and Grimmjow have more character development than people like Ishida and that makes no sense when you know they’re just going to be here for one arc. Character : The characters created by Kubo are truly a blessing. Kubo really managed to give all of his character a certain charm either by Fan Service (RANGIKU-SAN) or just because they looked badass. Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Aizen, Ichigo , Zaraki, Kisuke and Shinji are all formidable character. Either by their way of thinking, the mystery that surrounds them or just because they’re fucking badass😂, they keep the show united and make it a 100 times better to watch. Like when Shinji and all the other Visored arrived in the final battle against Aizen I was so hyped to see them fight. The world built (universe) : I think that the universe of Bleach is really a major force of the anime. The universe is so vast and old that we can’t really predict what will happen or what enemy will oppose Ichigo. And that’s really a thing that I liked about Bleach is that it doesn’t have “boundaries”. Like Soul Society is soooo old that we don’t even know the whole story of Soul Society and it’s captains. So with this really “ancient” universe, there’s an infinite of possibilities for new antagonist or just to know more about the history of Soul Society. Sense of conflict : THE FAMOUS SENSE OF CONFLICT😂😂. This shit is sadly true. Imma ask this real quick, who died ?😭😭😭 NOBODY. This shit made me so sad sometimes like a good death here and here doesn’t hurt in anime, it’s beneficial. Just take for example Naruto, if Itachi and Jiraya didn’t died, would Naruto be as good as it is now ? The answer is no. I mean yeah sometimes I felt stressed because some character were on the brime of death but even then I was like, it’s impossible they die, we’re in Bleach😭. I mean if Rukia or Renji or just even someone like Madarame would have died the show would have been 100 times better. Like expect the moments when Ichigo was depressed and when at the end of the Arrancar arc when Ichigo used the Final Getsuga Tensho, the show wasn’t sad at all. And that’s a major negative point that I hope will be fixed in the last arc that will come out, normally in 2021. Fillers : 45%..... Yup, this is the pourcentage of filler in Bleach. I mean not all filler of Bleach are bad but dammmn they are soo long. 40 episode per arc, that shit just doesn’t make any sense. Honestly expect the first filler arc who was really really bad the other filler arc were ayt or good (6-8). It wasn’t even the story that was boring, it’s just that it takes them 20-25 episodes to introduce some character and THEN they begin de real story. The sad thing is that the end of the majority of the filler arcs were good ngl but just the fact that you got to pass through 25 episodes of pure shit to really begin the story is truly sad. But that aside, the real pain is that it breaks so much the flow of the story. I personally wanted to watch Bleach in its entirety for the first time, so when I finished the Soul society arc, I was so hyped to continue the story but then Boom, I got to face a 40 episode filler. I truly think that if I rewatch Bleach in like 2 years and that I skip the filler, I would enjoy a 100 times more the anime. Ost : The OST were.... ABSOLUTE BANGERS. Like each and every one of them were a masterpiece (I may be exaggerating but that’s okay they’re still beautiful). Like at the beginning I really liked the ost but nothing more, they weren’t special or made me want to sing with them or whatsoever. But then when the Arrancar arc arrived, the Ost were revolutionary. They were sooo good that I sang with them each time they were played. Honestly, I think the Ost are something underrated in anime because when I was watching the fillers, the Ost made the fillers much more enjoyable ( Yeah, I was really down bad at the first filler arc💀). Plot : The plot is the greatest strength of Bleach. I can already hear all the Bleach haters saying : “The only plot you got is Aizen.” and they’re not wrong. Well they’re just 75% right because the last arc take a complete different path and forgets about Aizen, which is making me really excited for the manga. But that aside, I personally don’t find it a negative point that Aizen is the main plot. It’s not like Aizen being the only antagonist makes it boring or without plot twist, on the contrary, Aizen bring with him a ton of plot twist and you can’t say that you don’t like him. If you forgot the fillers, the plot is really amazing and smooth, it isn’t boring and keep you entertained until the end. Just after the formidable Soul Society arc, we directly see Ichigo meeting Shinji who briefly explain him what he is and ask him to join their group (My personal favorite character). Simultaneously, we learn that Ichigo’s father is a Shinigami. So we begin the arc with a lot of information and it let us theorize about the origins of both Visored and Isshin origins. Honestly, the only negative point of the plot that comes to mind, is the fact that it’s not very well balanced. By “not well balanced” I mean that I would’ve liked if they explained and talked more about the origins of Soul Society itself and certain characters like Ichigo’s father. I really liked when they did the backstory of the Visored and the backstory of Urahara because it allowed us to understand more about Soul Society and how Soul Society worked and with what rules. I hope they do it more in the manga 🤞. Form/Powerups : The form and Powerups of Ichigo are a really good point of this anime. They’re charged with emotion, hype and they’re f*cking badass. The thing that I really like about Ichigo’s powerups are that every time that he’s training for a new form or technique, he puts his life on the line. Yeah, I know he’s not going to die even if it’s risky or whatsoever but it really adds a lot of intensity to the training and so a lot of emotion when he finally succeed to attain the new form. Even if Ichigo attains a new form he don’t become overcheated. Like when he obtained his Bankai to fight Byakuya, it still was a tight match between the two. I don’t say that every fight is like that but even when Ichigo was fighting Ulquiorra or Aizen he used techniques that had a big after effect or he just couldn’t control it. So that’s why I say he’s not overcheated at the end because he can’t even reuse the same techniques. My favorite powerup is the Final Getsuga Tensho because I personally think that it was the one charged with the most feelings. Like just knowing that he’ll lose his reaitsu had left me shocked and in pain. Fan service : THE FAN SERVICE😂😂😂😂. The best one no cap (I didn’t saw Fire Force yet so calm down). Honestly, first time I saw Rangiku I knew I would like Bleach💀. No but seriously the fan service is magical. Like they were so many episodes where Rangiku just got drunk and she was acting deliberately to show her boobs, just magic. Bro even her Zanpakuto was fine as hell ( Saying it like that, I know it’s weird because it’s just a sword but if you’ve watched the fillers, you understand me💀). But really the episode were the title could have been Fan Service, is the episode 228, also called “The Greatest Filler of All Time”. If you know, you know💀 Only Ichigo’s fights matter : Yes there’s times to times that Ichigo don’t fight in important fight but even there there’s a reason that he can’t fight ( He’s either injured or in a whole other dimension). Like except some arrancars that were killed by Byakuya, Renji, Ishida and the other captains, the fights where Ichigo isn’t participating are pretty rare. Like I mean the fight against Aizen was put in f*cling slow mode so bad just to wait that Ichigo returns from Hueco Mundo. Like I would’ve had enjoyed so much more the fights if they weren’t meaningless. Honestly before Ichigo arrived there was only 2 injured, Ichigo arrived and then Boom everyone was defeated in the blink of the eye, even f*cking Yamaji got beat by Aizen in like 5 minutes. Just so that it can become Ichigo vs Aizen. So that’s why I would have preferred if some people actually died before Ichigo arriving. That would have prove that not just Ichigo’s fights bears meaning. Favourite fights : Zaraki vs Ichigo Ulquiorra vs Ichigo Ichigo vs Grimmjow Aizen vs Ichigo Arrancar n°1 vs Kyoraku Inoue vs Sakura to know who’s the more useless ( Joking💀💀💀don’t attack me) My rating of the arcs : Soul society Arc : 9/10 First Filler Arc : 4/10 Start of the Arrancar Arc~Grimmjow fight : 8.5/10 Second Filler Arc : 6/10 Hueco Mundo Chapter Restart~Start of the fights Aizen vs Gotei 13 : 8.5/10 Third Filler Arc : 6.5/10 Resume Fights Aizen vs Gotei 13~Ichigo arrival to Karakura Town : 9.5/10 Start of the fight Ichigo Aizen~End of the Arrancar Arc : 10/10 Fourth Filler Arc : 4.5/10 Fullbring Arc : 9/10",8,Recommended,"Jan 30, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_37a380d69f,20
