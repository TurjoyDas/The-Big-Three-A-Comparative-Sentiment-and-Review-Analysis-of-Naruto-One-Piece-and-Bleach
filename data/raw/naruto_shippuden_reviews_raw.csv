"------------------------------------- Naruto Shippuden : Review | ------------------------------------- Naruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. Let me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has been the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular while also explaining its flaws. ----------- Story - 8 ----------- The story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below. Let's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole. The issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don’t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. However, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is, Pacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up. Now that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives. The main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. Another thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out. The amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious. Something that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments. Being a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines. As I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. Variety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these! The last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves. Throughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning. -------------------- Characters - 10 -------------------- Now this is the core of the franchise. Each character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out. No matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. You will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships. Now let's move on to the ""Villains"" This series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes. *Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the ""heroes."" The morality here is blurred. But coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it. ----------------------------- Art and Animation - 7.5 ----------------------------- Again we have a mixed bag here. This show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par. I think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita’s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! Despite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation. And as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this. -------------- Sound - 10 -------------- This is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like. ------------------------------------------------ Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 10 ------------------------------------------------ Naruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself. And with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation. Sub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended ----------------------------------------------- | Recommendations for Similar Series | ----------------------------------------------- [Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series. [Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. [Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here. Whether the highs of Hunter X Hunter matches up to the highs of Shippuden or FMA Brotherhood is up for debate, but you won't have to sit through any lows like you have to endure with Naruto or Naruto Shippuden.

"After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. Now I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series. Story: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me. Characters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10 Art / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10 Sound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10 Ok, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? Pacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing! Arguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. Overall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 31, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d78c3fde7,1
"I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. First of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage, being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. I loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. Akatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10) Of course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) To be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) In Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development. (10/10) So, to justify and defend Shippuuden... First of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. Naruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",10,Recommended,"Mar 6, 2011",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d7c01df3a,1
"First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end. Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone. This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that. This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? I'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true. At times the fillers can be funny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line. There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times. The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great. But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around) I don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer. I'll start off with the characters. The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters. I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds. The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was. At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line. The plot was pretty interesting, but very long. While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up. Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important. The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together. I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that. Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well. In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show. It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases. I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons. I highly recommend watching this whole anime. Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end. While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels. The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions. This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",10,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2a418394ea,1
"Oh, I hope that I’ll be the first to write the review when all the Naruto anime series end. Well, what should I start with… 15 years. For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it … it’s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Though the journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand – this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years – the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now – a husband… ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation. Now let’s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. I’ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind – Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible. Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they’ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows’ drawing it does not make the original run look worse. Unlike art styling – music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos’ OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero’s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains’ theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer – Yasuharu Takanashi. The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they’ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that – they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that’s because I felt much the same as the main hero and ‘ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human’s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them – it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is. Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years. I personally bow to all of you and say: “Thank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!” And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.",8,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4698d88a04,1
"Let me just clarify this now while we’re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I’ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you’d care to know why, or you’re simply curious, read on. Story: 10/10 I personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it may not be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. In the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn’t just some ‘demon-fox child’, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it’s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that. Everything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself. Art & Animation: 8/10 Simple. I’ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it’s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it’s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters’ faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real. Also, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, ‘We saw that scene literally an episode ago!’, and honestly, it’s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we’ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it’s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. Sound: 8/10 The openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great! Character: 10/10 Character; also translated to the sum of ones’ personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it’s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now. We see how the ‘heroes’ have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be. The ‘villains’, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they’re not only ‘evil’ simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that’s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn’t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that’s, honestly, great. Overall: 10/10 Shippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that’s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn’t have become so popular if it wasn’t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn’t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don’t watch them. Simple. An animes’ worth isn’t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it’s amazing. So if you haven’t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.",10,Recommended,"Jan 17, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a2323b8bcc,1
"Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so. The story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always fun to watch But - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing. &quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know. The animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it). The soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. As of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development. So far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now. EDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8 To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",7,Recommended,"May 20, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db21b847aa,1
"Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entire anime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it’s worst, trashy nineties OVA. Shippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show. One good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves. Naruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I’ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto’s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs. It also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. Now, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of ""meh"", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. The worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it. And this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole! These final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can’t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I’m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it’s not enough to save the whole series. The “final” villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy. Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen. I could go on and on about every little thing, but I’ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I’ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 22, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db42a0cd84,1
"First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto. Naruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the first series. Naruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be. Story: 10 (Outstanding) I know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life. Art: 9 (Great) I didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score. I think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9. Character: 10 (Outstanding) I've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby. Enjoyment: 9 (Great) I had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it. It has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate. Overall: 10 (Outstanding) Overall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. On a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",10,Recommended,"Apr 4, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_feed73f2e8,1
"TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! [Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10] Believe it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest… or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in this super long show? Rage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. If you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! If the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. Overall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it! P.S.

"It's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked. Story: Ah, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obito and Madara were those two. The later of the War Arc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved. Art: Sadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said. Sound: Naruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime. Character: Naruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the ""muh sakura is useless"", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry. Enjoyment: Wow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. Overall: I enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed. Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, ""wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end"" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.",9,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_cfb6625a25,1

Most of the time is spent showing characters: running around (mostly jumping from tree to tree, it seems), standing tensely, with the wind blowing between them...Very productive and oh so tense. oh, almost forgot sakura's endless whining about poow nawuto and/or sasuke or someone/something else equally as unamusing. And naruto's whining about sasuke. Had to watch most of it on FF (3 second skip) towards the end of the eps I had. Another useful parallel quality-wise, would be DBZ...Except DBZ probably had more variety in the lack of plot :D.

In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that can relate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being ""overrated"", and that is exactly what I believe it to be. The story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of ""ninja battles"" vs ""demon battles"". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama. Indeed, this anime capitalizes on ""Talk no Jutsu"" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; ""oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog"". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes. Overall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of ""overpowered"" ninjas along with all the ""demon"" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ad1f65fd47,1
"Love gives birth to sacrifice. It's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one. Story: 6/10 I loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with the plot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper. Art: 7/10 It's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now. Sound: 9/10 I loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes. Character: 10/10 This anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. Naruto: Immature, hard headed, strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him. Sasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read; you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if you were completely off base. Sakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful. Kakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was. Pain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly. There are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever. Enjoyment: 7/10 My overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime.. Overall: 7/10 My overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. *I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime. But anyway please feel free to write on my profile, I want feedback!",7,Recommended,"Nov 16, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a02197601e,1
"This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say. I'll begin with my view on the story line. I had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those ""Yeah, I get it"" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate. I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those ""Yeah, I get it"" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^ Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest. Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer. Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",8,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6a24ec8720,1
"At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season. What started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun. We are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bits and pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun! I don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun. The art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun! Naruto is also no longer funny. Well, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch. Although I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably. Another %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke.

"227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion. Naruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad. Now we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple. This series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed by this DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger. Others may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it. Fillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like. The story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their ""forbidden"" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing. Some people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said ""gay"". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper. This is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.

"In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact an extremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games. He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their ""ninja way"", be it peace or revenge, etc. This anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. Taking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just ""this or that"". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do. (I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put ""about 3 years later."" I know anime fans can be very picky about your ""facts"". :d)",9,Recommended,"Nov 6, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_955c6aada5,1
"Another Shippuden Review by radiantfire Context: This review analyses Naruto: Shippuuden (simply referred to as Shippuuden from herein), an anime adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's shounen manga Naruto. At the time of writing, I have watched 39 episodes of the series. Story: Two and a half years after Naruto has ended, Shippuuden picks up with fresh new characters and story arcs. Although the anime generally remains true to the manga, small fillers give the story an unnecessary drag. It's somewhat amazing how, in some instances, 1 chapter can equal 2 or more episodes. However, I do find some fillers a pleasant addition to the general plot of the series. Animation: The animation, in general, is good. Most of the time, you get decent to good animation. Other times, however, offer repetitive frames as well as poor cases of movement and facial expressions. In fact, some positions just looks so awkward. Nonetheless, I find it decent to watch. Sound: The BGM is decent but it is incomparable to the amazing work of Toshio Masuda (main composer of Naruto). Emotions and moods aren't expressed as clearly by the BGM. Sound effects are generally alright, so too is the voice acting. Character: Shippuuden, at least, captures the essence of the characters. I like how they're generally portrayed. Evil characters are evil, good characters are good. What more can you ask for? Enjoyment: As a sequel, Shippuuden doesn't match up to Naruto (that is, if you don't consider all those fillers). As a separate entity, however, it's a pretty decent anime. I'm pretty sure there'll be mix comments on how people have enjoyed the series. I, for one, find it okay to watch.",7,Recommended,"Dec 13, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a330568186,1
"Naruto Shippuuden is the new Dragonball Z. Remember back in the day where it took like 6 episodes to finish something that should only take 5 minutes? Yeah... Naruto is turning into that. One of the biggest problems about the show is not necessarily the flashbacks (hey think of it as a supplement to the manga), but instead, the recaps. Recycling footage may have worked in the late 80's/90's, but this is ridiculous. You can tell that they're really just trying to prevent the show from going past the manga which, based on past experiences, is a good idea. However, fillers are better if some effort is put into them (unlike the fillers from the original Naruto). Other than this complaint, the sequel series has been a great improvement from the original series. The animation was superb and the music fits well into the scenes. The characters are well drawn, and it's great to see the battle scenes drawn well (I still cringe at the thought of what happened to some of the battle animations back in the original). The music, well, I'll admit that some of the ops have been really annoying, but I was instantly hooked with &quot;Hero's Come Back&quot;. Furthermore, it's great to see some better insight of some of the characters (which means, yes, I do appreciate some of the flashbacks). However, my biggest complaint about the show's character development is the fear that the script writers will revert back to the cookie cutter characters that they made in the past show, which just made things dull. I understand that a lot of the characters have a sad past, but please, cut down on the melodrama sometimes eh? The show is going to turn into a drama at the projected rate that we saw in the last filler arc. Other than that though, it's finally nice to see some villains that I don't hate with a passion though (I'm sick of seeing Orochimaru's &quot;I can't die&quot; routine). Anyways, here's my breakdown: Story: (10/10) Hey, the core story is very great, simple and yet it involve so many different characters. Characters: (9/10) Gotta admit, the characters are well done. It is great to finally see a better development of the old characters, and also, it's great to see the new characters be unique in their own way (how do you not like Sai's lack of common sense?). However, I'm sick of this &quot;you have no idea how hard my life was&quot; crap from some em... specially the last filler character, it's a bad reminder of the cookie cutter side protagonists that they made from the original Naruto in the fillers. However, other than that, Animation: (9/10) I think one of the strong points of this show was definitely the animation. Everything that was shown was very fluid which made the show very mesmerizing to watch. I gotta admit, one of the highlights that I found watching this show was watching everyone use their own specialty set of moves. Music: (9/10) Ok, I liked the music, it is so great and has it always make me so emotional. Final comments: Naruto Shippuuden is the ultimate anime out there for me. I will keep watching it week by week till the last episode (unless there are fillers involved)^_^!!",10,Recommended,"Oct 18, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_40accff41d,1
"Naruto Shippuuden Story(9) Well, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2, maybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days. Art(9) The art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel. Sound(9) There are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too. Character(9) As I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well. Enjoyment(10) Naruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch. Overall(9) Well, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P",9,Recommended,"Jan 19, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e59fcedd7c,2
"Yes, I'm writing a Shippuuden review. Why? I really don't know myself. Well screw that, lets get into the review. I read most of the other reviews to get an idea of what others are saying so I don't add to the pile of redundancy, and I see that many people have &quot;tried to love Shippuuden&quot;. After watching Naruto when I was 13 and loving it, I watched other animes and realized that Naruto was far inferior to most other quality animes. Yet, because I loved Naruto so much back then (It was my first anime), the thought of an amped-up, older, maturer, badass-er Naruto tickled my anime tooth (or something like that). The first thing that excited me about Shippuuden was &quot;YES! THE FILLERS ARE OVER! Now we can have some actual plot movement!&quot; The unfortunate truth: You're not gonna be getting any of that soon... Naruto Shippuuden feels like it could be going twice as fast, wasting half as much time, and developing characters like no tomorrow. Maybe no one has any ideas about what happens after the Sasuke issue is settled, so they're stalling. It certainly feels like that, and as the episodes drag on, I feel like im drifting farther from understanding the characters, who could be wonderfully developed. I had set my standards high for the new Naruto, but the only thing that happened in the years that I waited was I got older, the characters got older, the plotline got moldier, the fillers got bolder, and the enjoyment got colder. It feels like even sub-main plotlines are becoming fillers, which is a shame. Naruto has such potential because of its diversity and huge fanbase, but the sad truth is that shippuuden is not much different from the old naruto. Now that all the bad stuff is out of the way, the anime is not horrible. Its still a good anime, there's just not that special shine that you find in that anime that you usually weren't expecting. Naruto has an unbelievable amount of hype for younger kids, so if you're looking for something more mature, turn away. If you're a young viewer that just started on anime (who I doubt would be reading this, but nonetheless...) look no further than naruto. Again, its not a bad anime, its just slow, and you have to be patient. Unfortunately, that is one thing that I lack while watching anime.",7,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f6124820eb,2
"I don't know where to start, this show is outstanding. People have an annoying habit of talking down all the popular anime, and in some cases, popular anime does not deserve all the fame. But here I cant think of anything to talk down on! (Besides fillers of course.) But anyway, Naruto Shippuden has many strong points, characters, story, music, I cant think of an any elements to this anime that have dissatisfied me. It has a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Its still there although the comedy starts to fade off a bit in Shippuden, but thats because so much is going on! The characters, are very easy to become attached too. The Shinobi world is full of great people, each with their own quirk or trait to better the series. The most rewarding aspect of Naruto is probably the way all of the characters, especially Naruto, grow. Coming back from the time skip from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden, you really see the characters change. Even from early Shippuden to current Shippuden, Naruto and all his friends have evolved into outstanding ninja. It really motivates me, when I see Naruto accomplish near impossible feats, when he started as such a knucklehead. My favorite thing about Naruto is that he changes all the people he meets. The author gave his character a unique way with words that makes him even more interesting! The villains, truly project the evils of the ninja world. If there's a bad character, he's bad. They have you fearing them even though they're not real. They always seem invincible, which is the scariest part. The plot is great. There are so many things about this show that have went unanswered for so long, and the writer does such a great job of tying them all together! The plot progresses smoothly and quickly, the episodes are 23 min, but feel like 5. The twists are unforeseeable, and catch you off guard, yet at a certain degree, are slightly predictable. The foreshadowing is great. Something is said, than 100 episodes later something happens and you immediately think of the quote 100 episodes earlier. There are also so many powerful moments. I'll admit in a lot of the heart warming scenes I've cried. The best part is there's tears of joy and tears of sadness. The story really causes you to feel for the characters. The emotional/moral lessons you can get out of this are stronger than ANY anime I've seen. The fight scenes, 10/10. Each one conveys a unique message about life itself, and they are all powerful.They were all quite motivating imo. The theme of hatred runs throughout the story, and you see the clear differences of those who choose the path of hate, and those who don't. It also has great re-watching value, partly because you see all the foreshadowing. There are so many episodes, and a great number of them were memorable. Soundtrack was great, I loved the openings and endings. It was a pleasure to listen to them before and after each episode. If there's any advice I have for this show, don't go through it too fast. The show has somewhat delayed gratification. It's hella good when you take it slow. You can't rush straight into it. I'm going to be honest, it's probably way better to people who watched Naruto as kids, because they grew up, with him. They watched him grow and mature just as they did themselves, so it's extra special. But nonetheless, Naruto Shippuden is a great ride, and anyone can love it. I'd reccomend it to anyone whose already watched the original naruto series.It really is worth the time.",10,Recommended,"Nov 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4c18a52055,2
"Back in high school, I was an avid Naruto fan. I discovered the series when I was 14 years old and binged it all in 2 weeks, and started Shippuuden soon after. I loved it at first, and revered it during the Pain arc, but soon after I found the show started to decline in quality. And now looking back, I find the show had pretty serious problems throughout its run. Just to get this out of the way, the egregious amounts of filler amidst very few canon episodes as well as a lot of episodes consisting of 70% flashbacks and 30% actual content is seriously off-putting. Yes, I know Naruto spent his childhood alone on a swing-set; no, I don't have to see that scene for the billionth time. These aspects became so unbearable that I (and many of my friends) ended up dropping the show halfway through the Great War arc and just read the manga chapters whenever they would come out. Doing this made me realize how poorly the pacing and execution of that last arc was handled, and when I eventually went back to catch up on what I missed, I wasn't surprised to find these errors hadn't been rectified at all. I think there's a common theme to be had in considering the series that is Shippuuden: inconsistency. In almost every aspect here, Naruto excels at some point in time and then fails to deliver otherwise. The series is definitely one of highs and lows, and I think the lows have overwhelmed whatever high points the series ever had. Story: 6/10. Our first look at the inconsistency of Shippuuden is targeted at how the various arcs vary in quality and immersion. I want to talk about what I consider the highest point and lowest point of the series: the Pain arc and the Great War arc (respectively). The Pain arc was a beautifully told story focusing on themes of abandonment, true peace, war, perseverance and acceptance. We saw amazing character development in Naruto: from the loss of his mentor/friend/father-figure to his ability to finally surpass his limitations and become a great ninja, it seems this was what the whole show had been built up to. Furthermore, we had an amazing villain to complement Naruto: Pain. A rather intriguing villain who we can empathize with, Pain and his tragedy really helped build on the themes of the arc. He challenged Naruto, both in physical prowess and personal philosophy, and through it all Naruto was able to learn what he holds dear. All in all, a really great arc; not without its flaws, but still a great story well told. Then comes the Great War arc, which is 1) too drawn out, 2) ignores character development and replaces it with obscure power-ups, 3) ignores 99% of the interesting cast to focus only on characters with special eye powers and Naruto, 4) has too many villains, each one diluting the significance of the other. This arc didn't need Kaguya. Obito and Madara were fine villains on their own, and whatever themes the arc wanted to handle could've been well done using only them. Once Kaguya is introduced, we go into the territory of power creep, bs powerups and no one being able to keep up with the villain unless 1) they're a main character like Naruto, 2) they have special eyes like Sasuke, or 3) they randomly get god powers (i.e. both Naruto and Sasuke). Chakra was such a great power system in the original Naruto that didn't model rather one-dimensional power systems, lie Ki in DBZ. It seems now that chakra unfortunately devolved into becoming glorified Ki. As an aside, if you watched this arc while it was airing and stuck through it, I'm not sure how you did it. I watched this arc while I was an avid fan of Naruto and ignored every criticism of it, and even then I had to drop it for a time to read the manga before I could eventually get back to watching it. The filler; the flashbacks; the slow pacing: all of these put me off. When an episode is 15 minutes flashback and 5 minutes of actually story progression, the show loses sight of where it wants to go and just becomes something that beats already explored themes and concepts down your throat. Art: 5/10. Inconsistent once again. Some scenes are downright shoddily drawn and bland. I understand that long running shounen tend to have this problem, and we see it a lot in shows like DBSuper and One Piece, but it still holds that the art leaves something to be desired. The show does have its moments with some pretty aesthetic character designs and well animated fights. The Pain fight is an example of pretty bad art at times, but amazing animation. Sound: 9/10. The OST for Naruto is pretty freaking great. However, given that the show has around 20 openings and endings (maybe even more, I haven't counted), there have been a fair share of really bad and really good songs. Character: 5/10. After the Pain arc, we see character motivations start to morph into one-dimensional determinations or become outright forgotten. The biggest offender is the Great War arc, which takes away 99% of an interesting cast to focus solely on Naruto and Sasuke and their bs powerups. Also, imo, Sasuke is probably the worst written character in the show. I don't want to get into an entire essay on why I think this (because trust me, I could), so I'll just list out some of my points for why I really despise him and the writing that surrounds him and his circumstances. 1) The love relationship between him and Sakura makes no sense. They literally have no chemistry together. 2) Itachi gives up his life to ensure his brother can live in peace, and Sasuke decides to start a war to honor him. Way to respect your brother's wishes. Alright buddy. 3) Dude causes grief to literally every character in the show, then pops up like it's nobody's business during the war and lets it slide that he's going to become Hokage. I actually had to pause because I burst out laughing. Did he really think he'd be taken seriously? 4) His overbearing arrogance borders on stupidity. He attacks a 5 kage summit, ignores advice from others and then cries about the arrogance of the leaders of the hidden leaf who put Itachi through pain. You're not any better, dude. 5) My last point, his undeserved strength and the fact that his relevance to the plot hinges on that alone. Without his eyes, he would be NOTHING. Everything special about him comes from Kishimoto giving him powerup after powerup; atleast in Naruto he had to work for things like Chidori. Now, he can just fire off infinite Chidoris, summon black flames that never go out and eventually conjure up a gigantic Titan made of chakra to dispose of enemies. Enjoyment: 5/10. My enjoyment, as well, was inconsistent: it varied a lot while watching, from downright bored to immensely engaged. I consider the Pain arc the highest point of the series and one of the best arcs in shounen, and that arc alone deserves a 9/10 at the very least. But after that, I'm afraid the show went through a downward spiral and destroyed itself with the final arc. Overall: 5/10. + Pain arc + Everything up to the Pain arc is somewhat interesting - Show falls into a downward spiral after the Pain arc and crumbles during its final arc - The diverse and interesting cast is underused in the final arc - Chakra loses its nuance - Fights after Pain become a matter of who can stack on more god power + eye powers to win - Some sub-plots are entirely ignored and never answered in the show. If you really want to watch Naruto, you might have a better time now that you can skip the filler, but the pacing still leaves something to be desired. At the very least the manga fixes the pacing problem somewhat, but I still find it fails to deliver in terms of story and characters. All in all, the show was a major disappointment.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 10, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_de5a2c94b7,2
"I was a little late to the Naruto party, i started watching the anime 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. As many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. Putting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was very nice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it. Overall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",9,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_65bce11910,2
"""I will bring Sauske back no matter what!"" That quote pretty much sums up a lot of Naruto Shippudean and people who read this review if you haven't watched Naruto then I suggest you watch it because there are somethings you need to know before starting Naruto Shippudean because Naruto Shipudean contains spoliers if you haven't watched Naruto. Naruto Shippudean is a new story that revolves around Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno's adventures and their search for Sauske Uchiha after he defected from Konoha in order to gain Orchimaru' power. There are two new characters that join in Naruto Shippudean which is Yamato and Sai. The plot also involves the active Akatsuki in their quest to obtain all of the tailed beasts. The art style of this anime is really different compared to the first episode of Naruto. In Naruto it was kind of a little bit cartoony a little bit but it still looked like anime. In Naruto Shippudean the art style was newer and the effects were a lot better in Naruto Shippudean. The Characters in the story there is a lot of them but I am going to focus on the main characters. Naruto has the Nine Tails inside of him. He ultimately gets stronger because He is so obessed with getting Sauske back so Sauske is getting him stronger and making him move further. Sakura Haruno is a girl from Team 7 or apart of Naruto’s team. She has gotten stronger because she was trained by the 5th hokage Tsunade who is strong in the previous Naruto series she was obessed with Sauske and practically was in love with him but she was a weak character but now I see her getting stronger. Sauske Uchiha was a former Leaf Village Ninja who decided to wanted to gain more power so he joined Orchimaru and Orchimaru trained him a lot and how he got stronger is because of his hatred towards his brother Itachi and he wanted to kill him because of what Sauske think Itachi did. My overall enjoyment for Naruto Shippudean is that it’s a very good show and if you liked Naruto then I suggest you watch this show because Naruto gets a lot better and stronger. There are things that happen in the anime that will shock you or you didn’t know about different characters but Naruto Shippudean has a lot of in depth fillers about some characters past and I won’t spoil anything because that is for you to find out yourself. The show is still airing as of now and the way things are unfolding is pretty good.

"Naruto: Shippuuden review Naruto: Shippuuden is one of the most famous anime of all time, but sometime, being famous doesn’t mean it is good. People generally just base their opinion on what they liked but not on what they disliked about Naruto so that’s why you might have heard that it is a good show. If people love so much this anime, it is basically just because they found it entertaining or because they grew up with it, but if we look at it objectively we can clearly see that it is a huge waste of time and attention. First, the main story line is about Naruto dealing with Obito’s past. Let me explain myself, Obito was in love with a girl called Rin when he was around twelve years old. That girl died because she had a beast sealed inside of her that was supposed to destroy her village. Instead of coming back to Konoha, she decided to kill herself to save some life. Even if she suicides, Obito couldn’t bear it so since that day he decided to avenge her by destroying the ninja world. Naruto will have to counter all his plan to save the ninja world and his precious comrades. So what sucks about this is that Obito is now a lot older and still didn’t get over it, which is just stupid. Almost everything that’s going to happen in this anime was indirectly or directly because of that incident that happened many years ago. It is so exaggerated, the Akatsuki exist because of Obito and there will be another Great Ninja War that last for more than the half of the anime (which is 500 episodes!). Second, the psychology of all the characters is messed up. You will learn the story of a lot of them and it might seem like a good thing at the beginning because it justified the fact that some of them are evil. In facts, it makes the anime last a lot longer for no reason because they all have the same story. There is more than one hundred characters and none of them has a unique story, including Naruto they are all thinking the same way so they all doing the same thing. Here’s a few of the characters story that you’ll see many times: 1. The character loses someone he holds dear, so he will want to avenge him by destroying the responsible and his village (Ex: Obito, Nagato, all the member of the Akatsuki) 2. The character is a total failure for martial arts and has a genius (a genius in Naruto is only someone who his not totally stupid cause they are honestly never doing anything smart) in his team, so he’ll try to surpass him and become hokage (Ex: Obito, Naruto, Guy sensei). Third, as I said before it is too long for no reason, but not only because of all the unnecessary character’s story. A fight in Naruto: Shippuuden can last for many episodes because of all the efforts of the director that wanted to make it epic. I remember that fight against Orochimaru that was like 4 episodes and two of them were basically Naruto standing in the middle of a bridge just to show the power of his beast and Orochimaru talking to Naruto in beast form that can’t answer him back. All the things that Orochimaru said were useless, it was only a reaction to Naruto’s power. Another proof of that is clearly the Ninja war that last for hundreds of episodes. Every time that Naruto’s side finally succeed at beating Obito or Madara, there will be a stupid reason for them to come back with more strength. You’ll see that those two will be beaten two or three times each, but there’s always an excuse for them to recover. Fourth, there are a lot of character (especially girls) that are useless. Sakura for example which should be one of the three principal characters after Naruto and Sasuke isn’t doing anything and gives nothing to make the story go further. She is only in love with Sasuke since she saw him and always try to stop Naruto that want to bring him back to the village. Pretty much every female Ninja student in this anime exist because they love someone or just because some teams miss a girl. Even the Hokage (the chief of the village) is useless. She is one of the most unqualified person to take that role. She is very weak and dumb, the only thing she knows to do is how to lose a fight and give orders, but again she is a girl and her team needed one when she was young. Fifth, Naruto’s way of thinking just doesn’t make sense. He is always saying that what he wants the most is to protect his friends, but you’ll see that he will excuse Obito for killing a lot of them and his parents just because the guy said that he hoped for Naruto to become Hokage. All the bad things that happened to Naruto were in some way because of Obito and he wants to forgive him because of some worthless words? That is ridiculous! Normally I wouldn’t waste time on one specific characters like this, but it is the main one, so I think it is worth mentioning. To conclude, I think that Naruto: Shippuuden only has one quality, it is entertaining. Unfortunately, this one isn’t enough to make this anime a good one because of all the defaults that it has. If you are looking for an anime that has a good story, good characters, relationships with real feelings or some interesting psychology, you are not at the good place because it is too simple, too repetitive and doesn’t feel real for a bit. If you are interested, I can suggest you Katanagatari which has some theme in common with Naruto: Shippuuden but certainly a lot more mastered. Also, you can go look at Ranma ½ that inspired Naruto, a little bit too much in my opinion (It is a lot better, but not a masterpiece).",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 29, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3a76e283e4,2
"A continuation from the old Naruto. While only the first 2 episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \'same old\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement over the first generation.

"TL;DR + some OP and ED songs + short-living cool moments - fillers and flashbacks - visuals, all of them - overused sound assets - pacing and episode direction Story Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable. Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination. Art Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the ""characters move so fast""... Right. Background images could be split into 3 types - trees, village, cave. None of these are eye candies really. Sound Personally, more often than not I enjoyed opening and ending songs. What's worse though are background sounds. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible, but they were nice to listen to the first million times. They've become something like a trademark now and watching the episodes muted wouldn't wouldn't make any difference as you can easily guess what'll play. Voice acting has been ok at best. Naruto is still voiced by a lady. Character Characters didn't change at all at start, except they grew bigger and stronger. A lot later there's some development going on, but only between 2 main characters. It's still very refreshing to see though. So basically, Naruto is still gutsy dude who wants to be the very best and Sasuke is still darkness. That's about it. Enjoyment I enjoyed few nice battles or moments. Unfortunately, most of these were partially or completely destroyed by horrible pacing and animation. Most of the rest can be easily skipped. Overall Started off as ""ok"", but for a long time now, this show has been a mass produced garbage made just to milk more money from fans. The only way an episode can keep my attention is if I triple the playback speed. I suggest you watch this ONLY if you haven't seen the previous season and stop as soon as you start getting bored, because trust me, it will only get worse. Whether we like it or not, Naruto is a big piece of anime history and it shold be experienced by all fans (at least a bit).",3,Not Recommended,"Feb 28, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7d7a0bc257,2

"Naruto Shippuuden. One of the most popular anime series to ever be created. But did you see what I said? I said popular. Not best, not deepest, and not the saddest. But it is far from being, and I mean far, a bad anime. I came on to MAL completely surprised when I saw that it was rated #510, and even more so that Naruto was #800 something. I sat and thought ""why in the world is it rated so low?"". I looked around on MAL for a little while, and I figured out that there are a couple reasons it is so bagged on. 1. Filler. People decide that because Naruto has more filler than the other ""Big 3"" that it has a horrible plot and deserves a 5 for a score. To you people that do that, you should be ashamed. Where do you get off rating a wonderful anime like this one, a 5 because you think there are too many fillers? It's just stupid, honestly. 2. People like to throw rocks at things that shine. I've talked to people who, no joke here, rate low because it is popular. That isn't as common here, but I still see it. and 3. People come in to Naruto already thinking they're going to hate it. News flash, if you come in like that, you come in looking for flaws. And trust me, you will find flaws, Naruto is definitely not perfect. Although, those flaws don't merit this anime the score it has here. That's all I wanted to say. I didn't come here to talk up Naruto, I came to defend it. And sure, you can call me a fanboy. You'd be right, but I'm not so ""fanboyish"" to let it get in the way of my judgment. I've decided that I wont make this into a ""real"" review because I'm satisfied with the other reviews.

"Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant. This is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation. If you are a fan of anime's such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai 7, Pokemon. There is a massive possibility you will like it Shippuden. If you have watched the first series then you will adore it as in my opinion this sequel is even better.

"[Story] Great story, won't put too much because I wouldn't want to spoil anything. The story of Naruto Shippuden follows a few years after the events of the original series. Naruto, the main protagonist, is a ninja that everyone loves. He is goofy, nice, not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but determined to help the people he cares about and gain the respect of the people in his village, never straying from his path to become the Hokage. (Hokage = Leader of the village) Naruto is a Jinchuuriki, or a person who has one of the nine mystical tailed beasts sealed inside of him. This often caused him great grief and sorrow early on in his life because the villagers feared and hated him for what he was. He occasionally has bouts with the nine-tailed beast inside of him, usually over control of his body and the use of it's evil power or chakra. In Shippuden, a lot of the focus is geared towards the Akatsuki, an evil organisation with a plan (not revealing) and Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" Sasuke. I'm done typing about the story, so if you want more, watch the show and you'll quickly pick up what's going on. [Sound] A sound effect for everything, like there should be. The ambient sounds and situational music haven't changed in forever+2. They were good when the series started and that hasn't changed, I only give it a 7 for never ever ever ever changing. [Art] Well they don't change clothes, so they must either not sweat or have really great hygiene. I'm not one to judge art too harshly, but the angles are good and you can usually tell what's going on in a fight. [Character/Hate] Main characters: Naruto - Pretty much described in the [Story] section. Sasuke - Emotional, tormented, get's exponentially stronger every time you see him. Sasuke is Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" that Naruto is always trying to save. Sasuke has a horribly tragic beginning in which his whole clan was slain by his brother who then taunts him to grow spiteful and strong to eventually come and get revenge on him. Tobi (No spoiler) - A member of the Akatski with a plan. All I can say when putting the words ""no spoiler"" in it. Won't go on about the side characters, except for this following hate part: The characters are great for the most part, except for Sakura... ok, pretty much every female ninja. All the female ninjas in the series are portrayed as weak, emotional, annoying, bothersome, in-the-way, etc.. overall useless individuasl in a male oriented ninja world. Sakura does nothing in fights other than get in the way and attempt to heal people (pretty much always failing) at the end. When she's not failing, she's punching our friendly protagonist in the face and being an all around bitch. Hinata is portrayed as thinking of Naruto all the time, like she has no life apart from her childhood crush, except from when she's being put down at home for being a girl. Ino, short story, she's a bitch that you could never want to relate to. I'd have to say the only women in the whole series that isn't a total failure is Tsunade, because she doesn't take shit from anyone. She still has her occasional emotional breakdown though. [Cons/Hate] First off, I love this series to death. The five minute episodes go by so fast, and I say five minutes because that's about all the time in each episode that isn't dedicated to some flashback of the last episode's flashback. When the plot is actually being advanced, it's exciting and attention holding. Unfortunately the show is also so entangled with filler episodes, which I skip, so much so that it feels like they make an episode once a month! [Overall] Great show, been following it weekly since the original Naruto series first aired. If you are looking for something entertaining, this could very well be it. This show would be great if you just start watching because you can browse through the currently 254 episodes, skipping over countless fillers and flashbacks, and actually enjoy the advancing plot, exciting battles, and interesting twists. Even though I consider Shippuden superior to the original series, I would recommend watching the original first to get some background as to what is going on, or you can actually watch the flashbacks. 10/10 - I hope Naruto Shippuden stays alive.",10,Recommended,"May 11, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_304075c1d8,2
"Like many people know Naruto it's one of the most famous animes and a smash-hit manga that sold 5 million of copies or more just in U.S. and besides that it's one my favorite animes that I could watch and rewatch it many times. Although many people say that it's not so good as they expect it i think Naruto and Naruto Shippuden ( but more this one) it's that kind of anime that we learn something usefull to our lifes since muscular strenght until the strenght that comes from our Heart, and that can't be paid at any circumstances. If you're thinking in starting to see it I advise you to do it because it's that kind of anime that when we stop watching and then we have 20 episodes of delay we can't stop watching, and yes it sure has a lot of fillers but you don't have to watch it.",9,Recommended,"Mar 28, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5594cb5baf,2
"An incredible work ethic and boundless determination should never be underestimated. At first glance, Naruto Shippuuden, the continuation of Naruto, has a few noticeable differences. Firstly, Shippuuden shows its complexity and serious undertone early on in the series, through the obvious change in Naruto’s personality. And secondly, protagonist is easily defined as Naruto, opposed to our duo of Naruto and Sasuke in the previous season. The story of Shippuuden is driven through the ploy of the Akatsuki, whom are fixated on capturing the jinchuriki and extracting the tailed beasts within. The canonical plot of Shippuuden is definitely attention grabbing, through the use multiple plot twists and numerous life or death situations. The non-canon plot however, is not so great. Overused flashbacks, dwelling on insignificant season one plot, and the apparent need to remind us of events that take place no less than a dozen episodes ago gets tiresome, quickly. It’s truly a shame that the amount of filler in Shippuuden is so high, because the canon portion is outstanding. Once the storyline unfolds after a few episodes the character cast of Shippuuden presents great depth and variety. Each of the reoccurring Hidden Leaf Village shinobi and kunoichi are developed to a great extent, they each have a unique back story and you’re almost certain to find someone you can relate to, if not, become attached to. The ninja of the other main villages and the antagonists all display distinctive features that allow them to be memorable, be it the untouchable Kazekage, Gaara or the cunning missing-nin Orochimaru. The quality of artwork in Shippuuden’s canonical differs greatly from the non-canon. It’s painfully obvious that the filler in Shippuuden is of a lower standard than its counterpart. With that being said, in the main storyline, Studio Pierrot has done a great job. Battle animations are fluid and eye-catching, the scenery is vivid and emotions are portrayed outstandingly. Simply, an outstanding soundtrack, those are the first words that come to mind when I think of Shippuuden. With outstanding openings such as OP3 “Blue Bird” almost welcoming you into an episode with open arms, and endings such as ED12 leaving you begging for more, the soundtrack of Shippuuden is definitely a memorable one. The composer Yasuharu Takanashi incorporates gritty strings, rhythmic percussion, penetrating woodwind instrumentals that captivate the moment, from intense, heart pumping battle music, to calm, vivid emotion evoking melodies, no expense is spared. Overall, Shippuuden is an amazing ride if you can either grind your way through the filler, or skip it entirely. The canonical plot more than makes up for the shortcomings presented though out its counterpart. Comedy is used at appropriate times, the action is engaging and the emotions are high. If I’ve learnt anything from this viewing ,it’s that sticking through the bad times with your head held high whilst never lowering your work ethic will rewarded, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely someday, believe it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 12, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fc82b6db7b,2
"Where to start ¬_¬ The series is full of action and comedy, lovable characters and great build ups. The story itself is very clever and full of twists. However. THE FILLER IS F*****G stupid... yes it was great to see Naruto fight ""the bad guy"" but then, when you think you will see the rest of the story, like 20 episodes of filler are chucked at you. NOT SO GOOD.

"Naruto is and always will be one of the great long shonen series out of all the shonen series. It has provided a story that still makes its fans wanting more, it has revived criticism for its filler but when filler is not being aired it is excellent. Story 10/10 Naruto Shippuuden is the sequel of the first series of naruto and continues on from when naruto goes to train with his personal sensei jiriya so he can get stronger to find and rescue his best friend and rival sasuke. But the story of naruto becomes much more than that as the series progresses with so many unexpected twists and turns. If you want a good story i strongly recommend this anime. Art 7/10 Naruto has shown that is has many strong points when it comes to animation but when it comes to consistency of quality in animation it dose not fair to well. The anime has had moments when the quality has strongly declined (Battle of Pain) but most of the time the anime keeps up the quality. Sound 9/10 The sound fx of Naruto Shippuden to the soundtracks and sounds of attacks are nothing short of awesome. The music playing while people are fighting in the anime have an elegant sound to them and gives a nice feeling of relaxation while watching the fight unfold. Character 10/10 The Characters are nothing short of amusing and interesting every single one of the are different and they all have different goals in mind. Which leaves you wondering in naruto shippuden every time a new character come on screen you become intrigued about what the character will be like. Enjoyment 10/10 I Saw the original series for the first time in 2006 from a recommendation from a friend and i loved it after a few episodes once i finished i had to go on into shippuuden which was twice as good. The original naruto was differently a calm before the storm for shippuden because of the amount of enjoyment that shippuden gave later on. Over al 10/10 I would recommend this series to anyone in a heart beat regard less of their anime preference.",10,Recommended,"Jan 14, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4e0e9a51be,2
"OK, this is my first review. So far in Naruto Shippuuden, I got to say I enjoyed it but most find it slow because the days it's being aired and you have to wait 1-2 weeks. I, for one, read the manga, which is really starting to yet interesting but I also watch the anime, when the episodes come out. There are some who are starting to dislike Naruto Shippuuden because of &quot;fillers&quot; and yeah. Overall, I find the animation similar to the original Naruto, but there were some changes in it, too. There is and gonna be more action in Naruto Shippuuden, I can tell, since I read the manga, some do too. If you are a Naruto fan and just can't wait until the new releases for the episodes, I suggest to read the manga, there are some sites online like; onemanga.com. If you've seen the latest release of Naruto Shippuden, which is episode 27, you should start on Chapter 276. But it would be nice to keep up with the new releases of the episodes and chapters. The new releases of chapters also take 1, sometimes 2, weeks to be release, similar to the episodes' releases, but the manga is way far ahead. The Characters in Naruto are totally awesome and have interesting powers/skills/techniques, well, the characters that are going to appear, later on in Naruto Shippuuden, so the excitement of Shippuuden only just begun, there's much more that's gonna happen, Enjoy!

"*********it's not a review it is just a oneway conversation from my heart********** and yes it is has spoilers Today at 5 o'clock in the evening something came to an end it was series which I cherished for the longest time since I can remember with the end of the series I want to share something with some one whoever they may be. I clearly remember the first ep of naruto which I ever watched its was a episode from the chunin exam when naruto is writing the test which he doesn't know but the way he handles the situation was pure epic then I watched the first season of the series the zabuza arc and I was star strucked. The strong desire of the main character to be acknowledged by by his village and his friends was something that resonated with my thinking's. Then the series was such a great part of my life that I cannot put it into words When naruto cried I also feel the pain when he work hard he inspired me to do the same and when he achieved some thing it made me so happy that tears started to flow from my eyes There were many moments which I will never forget like say for instance The first time he defeats neji after he wins he takes a victory lap around the arena and everyone in the audience is just shocked to see him win. At that time I was feeling like this is what I want to be. And the infamous scene from after naruto returns the village after defeting pain and the scene in which iruka is telling his story was so heart touching that it made me proud. The story itself was so good that I can overlook many things The back story of naruto was so sad I clearly remember the ep 'thank you' in which he meets with his mother it was just so beautiful At this point you may be thinking that he is just overestimating the series so yes I am. But I too cannot ignore the curse which was making a epic series a avrg one 'filler' it was bullshit pure bulshit, no no it was worse the bullshit Only the novel adaptations were worth mentioning. But living that aside it was a good series and for me a inspirational one So seeing the last episode made me a bit emotional it was 9 years of journey for me and yes I am happy that it ended but I also feel a bit sad So if you have not watched naruto a you feel that you are a failure I think you should give it a try Bcz I know if you can connect with it you will not be disappointed.",10,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d24dafa5d9,3
"I find the series enjoyable and captivating at times although it does occasionally lose track of the main story due to filler episodes and becomes quite dull when it slows down a bit, it will frequently pull you back with spectacular fights and hilarious character situations that will keep you watching. Overall I recommend this anime because it makes you feel almost as though your are standing next to the characters, fighting alongside them and makes you hungry for ramen... You will often find yourself getting attached to characters, whether it's because they are similar to you or you like the depth of their character you will find yourself rooting for them whenever they are in trouble.",8,Recommended,"Apr 27, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_87cdd57408,3
"Did you enjoy watching Naruto, or are you still reading Naruto's manga, impatiently waiting for next chapter? Then Naruto Shippuuden is NOT for you. As Naruto was an great anime, it's successor is just one, big soap opera. This &quot;work of art&quot; is overloaded with fillers and many sub-plots. What is more, every one fight or event is extended to the maximum possible amount of time - because of &quot;we-don't-want-to-reach-manga's-plot-so-soon&quot;. Oh, look, it's Kakashi preparing an eye technique! In manga, it was prepared within 2 frames.

"FAIL That sums up Shippuuden in one word. The animation looks cheap and the facial expressions are not noticeable. Not to mention, the lack of character development is unforgivable, especially in the sub-characters. They show up in the first episode and then disappear. Very good. -__-' Just don't watch it. Watch something interesting like Gintama. At least it retains it's sense of humour, which is sadly lacking in this anime.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 3, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0ac67ea98e,3
"How do I even sum up this series? How can I review something so special to me? Still, it must be done, so let me tell you why Naruto is a series you can't leave on your PTW list. Let's start with the basics: sound and art. Naruto (especially Shippuuden) has one of the best soundtracks in anime. Not only with its openings and endings, but its OST songs fit the anime and its tone better than any other anime I've seen. The art is GORGEOUS. Again, especially in Shippuuden because it's more recent compared to the older animation of the original Naruto series. The lighting effects and bright colors make every scene entrancing. I don't know whether to talk about the story or the characters next because both are as high quality as high quality can be, but I'll start with the characters. You can't FIND development like this anywhere else. For one thing, each character is indisputably unique, and it's nice to watch an anime in which you can find a piece of yourself in every character. Also, each of their stories-- heroes and villains alike-- was developed with such care that you can't help but be interested. More than both of those things, though, the sheer power that these characters hold is what really makes them remarkable. Not physical power (though, that type of power gets developed really nicely and realistically throughout the series as well), but mental power. These characters are written with goals and convictions that bring them to life in a way that will capture your heart. You'll become addicted to the characters simply because they give everything all they've got. Now, finally, we come to the story. This is going to be hard to talk about without getting detailed, so I'll keep it as brief as I can by saying this: this story is special. It isn't always unpredictable, and things don't always end happily, but the journey you'll take is-- dare I say-- one of the best you'll ever take. The care that was put into developing this story so that it had the most impact it could have must have been immense. This very well might be the only story I've ever experienced in which I didn't want to skip ahead to see the ending at some point. Every part of the story was important and made me feel so lucky to have found a story like it; I wanted to savor it as long as I could. The story itself is an art piece. A lot of that was my emotions reviewing the anime and not actual critiques, but isn't that more convincing? Naruto has become so special to me, and I'm really, really glad that I got past my assumptions about it beforehand and took the plunge to watch it. I don't think I'll ever find something quite like this again-- and that's why it's so beautiful. Please watch this if you're even a little curious because it'll change your life, I promise you. ありがとう、ナルト.",10,Recommended,"Apr 27, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_46f4ea1169,3

"Naruto Shippuden. One of the most hated series that is super popular. Why is it so hated? No real reason to be honest. Atleast that is what I believe. But don't worry I am not calling anyone who hate it 'morons' or whatever i'm just saying I 'think' it should NOT be as hated as it is. Not even CLOSE. I myself though think that episodes 1-110 aren't THAT good but after that is when it starts to become a 10/10 anime. I will get on to the why. And don't worry I will not make it too long since I think people won't read it all meaning it will all probably go to a big waste of time. I will not give a summary of the series because you can just read it in the main page or pretty much anywhere else. OK now I'll say why I gave it a 10. (Scored FILLER-FREE). Animation (for the most part) gets a 10 and the music gets a 10 too (i also believe EVERYONE should give this a 10 music wise). I believe it has the best music ever along with One Piece CLOSELY beating the music of Pokemon, Bleach and Fairy Tail. The story gets incredible as it progresses and so does the level of enjoyment. Naruto and Sakura become better characters than before but Sasuke declines character wise (that's a given though since he does turn into a heartless villain). All the other characters are as awesome as they were from before (I myself only don't like Ino). The akatsuki are the main villains of the series and in my opinion best villains ever (beating Phantom Troupe and Homunculus by a LITTLE). They have unique special abilities and are VERY fun to watch. And there's Sai, Sasuke's well ... replacement and he is actually not a bad character at all either especially as the story progresses. The action is superb and VERY entertaining and at times you don't know who is going to die (not mentioning names). Sometimes the action is clever too. A lot of strategy is going on in them. So as a result from these things there is too much suspense in it for words. It is unpredictable and VERY suspenseful. They are in such situations at times that you do not know how the problem might get solved. Now I will counter the negative things it might have/people say it has but some reasons might not be good. First problem people say it has- Some parts are RIP-OFF from hxh (both). I have watched hunter x hunter 2011 (my 2nd favourite anime if anyone is wondering where it goes in my personal rank) but I do not at all think this series is a ripoff of Hunter X. The whole eye deal is similar. But it is not a copy.More like inspiration. a copy is doing it exactly like it was but the eye deal in Naruto has a different twist and special things added to it. Like i'm pretty sure Kishimoto (the author of Naruto) knows that something this big will be noticed. Why did he do it? Because he knows it's no big deal or that it shouldn't be. And I haven't heard the author of hunter x complaining to him either so yeah Naruto is not a copy of hxh at all. And to anybody who mentions the hunter exam and Chuunin exam rewatch both they are VERY different. The concept (again) might have been taken but the actual content is EXTREMELY different. Second problem people say it has- FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. Naruto doesn't have too many enjoyable ones but some (Chikara arc for example) are very good (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of Naruto (Shippuden in this case) filler' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. Third problem people say it has- the length. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 4 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). Anyways I know there might be reasons you will disagree with but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this a 10. Action, suspense, great animation, it is almost perfect (for me). Finally, I hope you enjoyed the review (took me quite a lot of time to do it) and that you give it a chance (especially from episode 110). Before that it is enjoyable but I find from episode 110 it's MIND-BLOWING.",10,Recommended,"Mar 19, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e89f098270,3

Though I really like the storyline due to reading the manga I must say i'm really disappointed with Shippuuden. Before this series came out I couldn't wait to see it because of how good the manga is but sadly I realized it's different. Naruto Shippuuden has got to be one of the most boring animes out. If you think you're gonna see an action packed anime think again for the characters stare at each other for 15 minutes before anything happens. By the time the fight starts you're already asleep.

after seeing 109 episodes Story: 7 - Good The storyline is somehow predictable but it never failed to convince me to watch the next episode.. (most of the time) Art: 6 - Fair The art was pretty fair. Not that good because i had seen other anime that has pretty good art than this. Plus point for the Akatsuki Costume. (even though its still simple but cool) Sound: 7 - Good The sound was good but sometimes they put weird background music! I can't just believe they see that as a good for the ears! Mostly the sound was good. Openings and Endings are about 90% good. Character: 8 - Very Good Some have unique characteristics and others are common. Some are annoying and others are likeable. Characters are made in such a way that they represent a unique characteristic. So it is likely you can choose easily your favorite character. Enjoyment: 9 - Great Enjoyed it up to this part. Action ~ Comedy ~ Ninja ~ Overall: 9 - Great OVERALL it is GREAT. I don't hate the fillers. Sometimes its annoying but the filler arcs are not bad at all so still the anime was GREAT. here are my plus and minus factors + (plus) action is very good... mostly this is the viewers are always looking for.. ninja action. kage bunshin no jutsu! awesome techniques! comedy is good too... it made me laugh in some ways... - (minus) too many flashbacks! super slow pace! (it almost took 5 episodes for a fight to finish) new characters are not that unique... they almost look the same from the others! an episode of pure talking! that's is so boring... most common example... jumping on trees then they talk about something for about 15 mins!

this is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack.

"I only read the manga of it. But the anime; I stopped at 263. This anime is the like the COD of anime. Well, you know why. If you are a MAJOR Naruto fan-boy; then do not read this. And please be mature about this. I also want nice comments about this review. And it's a tad bit long. 'Tis appeal. Well: as known as some might say; THE MOST POPULAR ANIME IN THE WORLD.

I used to love this show. But, there is something about this such as on fan-base and applause for this. Many also compare this show to other shows even some from a different genre.

Pretty much; people at my school only care about sex, dating, and reality shows like ''Jersey Shore'' or ''My Big Redneck Island''. The few that know what anime/manga is only know about Naruto, Bleach, and the BIG 3. They are not real anime fans really. They are just enthusiastic about anime. Let is be specific here: Naruto lacks character development. I don't want to spoil anything; but this has to do with THREE CHARACTERS that appeared in the manga and anime; but introductions for them was bad. And art was fine. Story was dreadful because with poor character development and there is no other form of intro to us when in lookout for other parts. Trying my best not to spoil. Sound and music was good; ARR-DUFF!

"Naruto: Shippuden - what can I say? I used to love this shit. Back in 2007 I would wait for the episodes, coming back from school every Friday to excitedly check whether or not the latest episode had been uploaded and subbed. Unfortunately I no longer find the series nearly as enjoyable as before. STORY I know this might anger all you angry Naruto fanboys out there, but come on guys, where is the story in Naruto: Shippuden? All it's about is our title character, Naruto, trying to bring Sasuke back from the dark side. I admit that Kishimoto isn't as bad as Kubo in this department (who seems to be making the shit up as he goes along; either that or he likes trolling us (eg: ""Who said the Espada numbers go from 1-10?!?!"" *trollface*) but of course that is an entirely different matter. All I can say is that at least Kishimoto seems to plan a few weeks in advance). I wonder if people ever get bored of Naruto chasing after Sasuke. ""But no, psyxwar, Naruto isn't just about him chasing after Sasuke!"" I hear you say. Maybe you have a point. It seems that the series is now about the Akatsuki, a criminal organisation, chasing after ""tailed beasts"", beasts of ""chakra"" (that's Naruto terminology for energy, ki, etc) with tails and their plan of world domination. I agree. There seems to be a little variation in events. This is why I have given Naruto: Shippuden a very generous score of ""2"" for Story. Of course, you, being the passionate, die-hard Naruto fanboy that you are, probably do not accept my reasoning and justification for giving Naruto: Shippuden a ""2"" in the Story department. Fair enough. But shouldn't you put this into perspective? Would you read a book that had a guy chasing another guy as its plot? I know I wouldn't. tl;dr: Naruto: Shippuden is about a guy chasing another guy ART The art of the anime is okay - nothing exceptional, but pretty good nonetheless. There are countless examples of newer animes with better art and more fluid animation, but I won't hold this against Naruto: Shippuden. I've seen far worse in my years as an otaku. SOUND The sound is good as well, but again, nothing exceptional. I would usually skip over the same opening after watching it one or two times which usually just means it's ""meh"". There was nothing godly like ""Hare Hare Yukai"" (where I would watch that every. single. time.) CHARACTER The character development and characters in general admittedly weren't that bad. Naruto definitely develops in skill (and maturity?) a fair bit over the course of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything so I won't really elaborate further on the issue of character development. I'd like to add that despite somewhat ""maturing"", this may simply be superficial as he still chases after Sasuke. He should know by now that he's a goddamn sociopath and wants to kill everyone and destroy his village. The characters are for most part unique with their own personalities. ENJOYMENT Did I enjoy it? Meh, it was alright. Nothing exceptional. I feel as if I've wasted hours upon hours watching this shit though. I feel that if I wasn't such a dedicated fanboy in my youth, I would have enjoyed this series a lot less.

"Okay so after seeing so many bashings of the anime i've finally had enough and decided to write my own review. STORY:10/10 Okay so the story is the same as the original Naruto series or rather almost the same , because as the characters develop and change so does the plot. And even though everyone complains about how the whole ""Save-my-best-friend-from-the-evil"" is really cliche i have to disagree. The story is so much more than saving Sasuke if you have failed to see that then it's understandible why you don't like the anime. Every character in the anime and their own story can be made into different animes that's how interesting some of their past and future acts are.There are alot of plot twists and i don't know about you guys but i find the idea to split Naruto into two part , Naruto and Shippuuden as in young and older, is really great. Even though we have this gap of 2.5 years of training ,as the anime progresses further we ,step by step, begin to uderstand just how much the charcaters and their atitutes have changed. ART:9.7/10 I don't know about ypu but i personally love the art , true at some point it does get lower in quality but i still like it. The fight scence are done really well ,you know the more inportant fights.Lately as the Kage Summit arc has started the animation is really smooth and good, too. SOUND:10/10 The openings and endings are great i don't know just how many of them i have downloaded and i listen to them ,like, everyday.The backround music is fitting too and the voice actors are doing an amazing job so far, too .I can't even imagine what it would be if the VAs change . CHARACTERS:10/10 Okay this is one of Shippuuden;s strong points, if not the strongest. Every character,almost, has development and if you actually look into them you'll see that Naruto, the main hero, has one of the littlest developments. We see that Sakura is stronger and she doesn't cry that much she is more independent and she has some feelings for Naruto as well , to what extent is unknown yet. Shikamaru's stories is also one of the best and we get to see just how responsible and genious he is. Sasuke is well.........Sasuke but he has changed alot too [ and i actually started to like him ] His and Itachi's stories is amazing you have to see thaat it's really complicaded and yet sp meaningfull and tragicly beautiful. Gaara has really been opening up to people , he smiles sometimes and he is friendlier and he puts alot of effort to change and act like a normal person.So as you can see most of the characters's backrounds are revealed even the Akatsuki members's and it's done in a really good way. ENJOYMENT:10/10 Naruto/Shippuuden is one of the best animes I have evr seen , even though i used to not like it so much at one point . The fillers i have nothing to say about, every long anime has fillers so that it won't chatch up to the manga that way there won't be anything to animate. OVERALL 10/10 I love this show mainly 'cuz at first it seems so childish and so smiple but it's actually alot more complicated and wonderful but i guess it's not really for everyone.

"If you want to be hung in suspense Shippuuden is for you. One of the best anime pick-upd ever. Naruto Shippuuden this is the show 2.5 years after Sasuke leaves Kanoha to train with Orochimaru. A show with action, Drama, and Fantasy was created by Masashi Kishimoto. There are currently 20 episode out but not for the US. I have been reading the Manga\'s and watching the episode for some time now and love it. Its keeping me in suspense waiting for the newest episode to come out when I\'ve read the manga already, but hey the shows sometime change you know lol.",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_58800891a5,3
"Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant.",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ba6508861f,3
"Before I even start the review, I would like to mention this is based off of the anime only. Story 6/10 I have to admit Shippuden starts off weak, but gets better once you reach the Hidan and Kakazu Arc which is the 5th anime arc. Then it keeps getting better until the Shinobi War Arc where both the manga and anime go way downhill. I always found Naruto had the best pacing and the most consistent story out of the big three. Even though many fillers, it wasn't until the War Arc where it started to directly affect the canon material and this was due to canon episodes and filler episodes being mixed together in one arc. Art 1/10 At first I defended Shippuden's animation because it was just new, not worse. And it was like that for a long time. Then came the famous fight between Naruto and the final Pein where the animation was just horrendous. Then it got a bit better, but when the 5 Kage Summit Arc started, animation began to go downhill. The point where I stopped defending the animation was the double episode 220 & 221. This double episode was the most inconsistent animated episode I have ever seen. Even if you are an anime only watcher, you could tell canon from filler just based on how the scene was animated. I am serious on this. But that wasn't even the worst yet! And the next example I am going to use may not be either since at this point it is only at episode 321, and unfortunately the animation may get even worse. Anyways the worst animated was episode 298. This was the first episode of a 2 episode fight; the fight Naruto and Killer B vs Itachi and Nagato. Don't get me wrong episode 2 was also bad but this was worse. Not only did the characters look like rag dolls swinging around when they fought, but Itachi didn't even look like Itachi. At least in episode 2 he looked like himself. And BTW these were canon episodes. Sound 9/10 I've always like the openings and endings better in Shippuden than in Part One. I guess they are more of my type of music. As for the soundtrack, it was different than Part One, but I enjoyed it just as much. I have always found that the OST's in both Part 1 and 2, were matched perfectly with the scene and the music is just really overly well done. Characters 5/10 Why I am giving this such a low score is because all attention is focused on either Naruto or Sasuke and every other character that showed promise in part one, seemed to be instantly dropped from the canon material. At least the fillers gave them a bit of spotlight, but in my opinion it was by no means enough. Enjoyment 6/10 Why I am giving this such a low score is because of all the filler that interrupts the series. Now that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the filler was good, but its just really bad; except for the Konoha History Arc which was done well. Overall 5/10 Face it, Shippuden just isn't as good as part 1. Maybe if Masashi Kishimoto would have focused on making more characters a part of part two and he paid even a little attention to what goes on in the anime, it might have been decent.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 11, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_98f72f01e1,3
"Here I am, typing out my second review of Naruto. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about this series, and not in a good way either. But first, let me tell you why I even bothered with this series. If you were in middle-high school in the mid to late 2000s, then chances are you were exposed to the full brunt of the Naruto craze. I was in 5th or 6th grade at the time and all I was ever exposed to were AMVs. It wasn't until a few years later that I decided to take it upon myself to watch the series to the bitter end. And what a wonderful mistake that was. Alright, with all the personal bullshit out of the way, let's get to business. Since I'm lazy, I'll just write a review for the original series by extension as well. Story: 3/10 About as predictable as you can imagine. Some bratty kid has an overly ambitious goal and the story revolves around him trying to reach it. And of course, he does, and some people might argue that the suspense lies in how it all happened. In other words, when there's already a foregone conclusion, all the stuff in the middle is supposed to be exciting. While the story is not necessarily ""unexciting"", it IS drawn out, bland, and riddled with plot holes. Villains are constantly revealed to be mere puppets for an increasingly more powerful villain, and all Naruto has to do to convince them to his way of thinking is talk to them. Rinse and repeat like four or five times. The story also contains way more characters than it can handle, as key characters from early on in the series, like Orochimaru, are simply forgotten in favor of other plot developments. The bigger fights can easily span over 5 episodes, leading to the action being just as slow as the plot progression. Ultimately, the story seems to take its focus off of Naruto and his journey to reach his goal and devolve into a somehow even less interesting Uchiha clan soap opera. Art: 4/10 The art is nothing spectacular but also not totally hideous to look at. The REAL flaw lies in its animation, which fluctuates in quality and shows a lack of care on the animators' part. Everyone knows the notorious Naruto vs Pain fight, one of the most major fights in the series. In an attempt to make the animation look more fluid and polished, the character's faces and bodies are stretched and skewed and basically everything goes to hell. Plus, there's the animators' crippling inability to draw faces or objects that are far away. Some of the filler characters are either intentionally ugly or just lazily drawn, but we're not touching those. Sound: 7/10 The soundtrack is admittedly pretty impressive. I mean, it's normal to get sick of the opening after the tenth or so time, but some of them really shine. The music is a mix of traditional Japanese instruments and punk rock, and somehow they just mesh so well together. However, I can't particularly choose a favorite track. There are very few that really stand out, but all of them are great. However, I think I have a clear bias towards Shippuden's soundtrack, because it feels grander and more emotional. Character: 2/10 (this is gonna be a long one) For me, THIS is where the series truly fails. As I said before, Naruto has way more characters than its story can handle. Stories with large casts that all have good development is possible, but this is not the case for Naruto. The first problem is that the main characters are significantly less interesting than the side characters could be. Naruto is designed to be a goofy yet charismatic guy who just draws people to him without explanation, but instead comes off as annoying and preachy. He inexplicably converts the worst of villains to his way of thinking, and it comes off as just plain stupid. It's possible to have one character be a moral compass and not have everyone worship them. Then there's Sasuke, who's designed to be a polar opposite to Naruto, but instead comes off as an edgelord. Rounding off the main cast is Sakura, who is supposed to be a strong heroine type but instead comes off a doormat who lets Sasuke toy with her emotions and relies on Naruto to do shit for her. The main cast is simply bland, but it's the villains I was most disappointed with because of how they were handled. After shaping them up to be generic bad guys without feeling or remorse, Kishimoto likes to trick you into feeling bad for them by slapping on a tragic backstory, usually shortly before or even after their death. Their backstories almost always involve the death of a loved one driving them to their current state. This is part of Naruto's message about forgiveness, but it still doesn't work as a narrative device. To make a villain sympathetic, you have to humanize them while they're still alive. The other reason Kishimoto fails at writing tragic villains is because their true motives are usually only presented to the audience as opposed to the characters in the story, and so the good guy never questions what they're doing (not that this would have worked anyway). In short, Kishimoto shouldn't have even bothered trying to make most of the villains sympathetic. Enjoyment: 4/10 As you can tell, I got bored with this series after all was said and done. Almost the entire cast was underdeveloped, and while the side characters had the most potential, they slowly but inevitably became part of the Naruto circlejerk that encompassed the entire ninja world. The animation tends to fluctuate depending on the animator's budget, and the story is exactly what you would expect from the Big Three: bland, incomplete, and way longer than it needs to be. I should mention that one of Naruto's messages is that previous generations should carve the path for the next generation to take their place. Now that its glory days have long since past, I think Naruto should do the same.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 12, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_139897a6c8,3

Animation: Characters have changed a bit, nothing much besides that, same style. Sound: Same as naruto. nothing note worthy Character: Everyone is back and they added someone new people to and it will just get better. However naruto is still pretty lame so it isn\'t perfect. Enjoyment: You get to see what happens after naruto, thumbs up to that. overall: Meh, IMO it should have been done like the manga and they shouldnt have changed the name of the show but hey atleast they havent had a single filler because of the giant span in story between the manga and anime.

I mean, when some ninjas bust in to an evil ninja groups lair, you dont have conversations with them!!!!! But overall, the shows great! Also, it has one of the best theme songs EVER!!!!

"I really love this series. Since the first inception of Naruto in 2007 up until now, I have not been disappointed. Naruto, a seemingly trite and boistrous young man who wants to become the next Hokage in the hidden leaf is now fighting to keep his friends and family from harm from the most volatile enemy he can ever face, which is Sasuke Uchiha. A long time classmate until Sasuke's sudden disappearance to join a hidden group of cut throat killers. Naruto now finds himself closer to his nine tailed demon as a partner rather than foe because of his mothers implanted consciousness. With the help of her, Naruto nears his goal of attaining the most powerful demon as his own weapon. But he still has a few fights left to overcome the obstacle. However in the middle, are his new friends from the hidden cloud clan. Bee, a man of weird intelligence which he likes to mix with rap in a conversation, helps Naruto beat his Nine tailed fox to such a degree, that the fox has no choice now but to listen. Yet their foe the Akatsuki, still need to acquire the nine tail fox in order to bring back the original demon - The ten tailed fox. All that is left is Naruto's and Bee's demons to make it happen. In the middle is Sasuke who wants nothing more than to destroy the hidden leaf, and with the akatsuki's help, his dream might be realized. Although now, with naruto's new powers of his sage mode and nine tail, sasuke will have even more of a challenge using his own dark evil demon. I think this series is great, to see naruto grow up from series episode to the next until his teen years, to now where he is virtually a full grown man, is enlightening. I have to say that for all the anime's I've watched, the story just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait until the huge final showdown between Sasuke and Naruto. But for now, I want to watch the Naruto Blood Prison movie coming soon. That should be quite the story.",10,Recommended,"Feb 23, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d6769e37a8,4
"This thing which many of you call anime used to be cool at some point until the producers decided to just destroy with loads of fillers. Of course, it was never a top anime. The twists and the storytelling is fine but I don't understand why is everything so Cliche in it. I mean, one character dies on the battlefield and everyone just stand still and stop fighting and look at that dying character. Also the dialogues appear to be the work of 9 year old writers. The art is fine but it got very bad in some critical points like the Pain arc. (I'm pretty sure everyone remembers the crappy animation and style during Naruto's fight with pain) The character development is fine also but they ruin it by giving them too many crappy dialogues. Overall it is good at some certain points but the story started to get worse and worse with time until recently when the story was just totally destroyed.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 3, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fda565c4a0,4
"Naruto makes up one of the Big 3. This review shall be for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden and shall contain my opinion of Naruto while trying to be as unbiased as possible. Before anyone asks, yes I have read Naruto entirely, and it was one of my first mangas/anime and I was somebody who thought Naruto was a perfect anime before realizing its fair share of flaws and before watching/reading other animes/mangas. Progression (6): Naruto is a manga with 700 chapters... 700 CHAPTERS, it is definitely long and of course has some useless arcs which make you wonder what the point of that arc was. There are also useless conversations that feel repeated between two characters in the show, and there are the past of characters remembered that are often repetitive. However, the fight sequences are done absolutely spectacularly. The hype level while major fights occur are often unreal and are often deserved because the fight scenes are quite good. Story (4): The story of Naruto is somewhat mediocre to be very brutally honest. It is riddled with Deus Ex Machina writing, so much so that the fans have dubbed the very often Deus Ex Machina writing with a term called ""Plot no Jutsu."" There are also some plot holes within the show, but I do not find too much fault with the plot holes as any show this long shall probably have at least one plot hole. The themes of Naruto would be good if they were not told from a black and white morality viewpoint in which the victor of the battle was always correct. Also the themes are not depicted very well (as with the case of Neji believing that heritage meant everything, and oddly enough turning out to be correct in the end as we find out who Naruto's father is, even though he concludes that heritage does not matter.) The biggest theme in this show seems to be about friendship, and although it's interesting the first and second time they talk about it, it becomes too repetitive whenever all Naruto says is his answers are his friends. Humor also loses its effect in the story when it's done in the middle of the story which breaks immersion. I wouldn't mind it if it was a slight chuckle, but the fact that they are trying to make you laugh uncontrollably drives you away from the story. Art (8): The art is not anything to write home about in Naruto, however the fight scenes are done very well. Very little times have I seen fight scenes in other anime and manga be able to compare to Naruto. Sound (10): The music in Naruto goes very well at times with what is going on in Naruto. In fact some soundtracks are good enough to be listened to without any accompaniment of the episode, such as ""Sadness and Sorrow."" Characters (1): My reviews are always honest, and being honest, I must be brutally honest that the characters in Naruto were AWFUL. The reason why I say this is that although there are interesting characters in the show, they become quite insignificant. My point is this, there are maybe 10 characters that matter in the entirety of Naruto, and everyone else could have never existed and the plot would have been relatively the same. Fan favorite characters such as Rock Lee or Neji become insignificant enough that towards the end of the manga, my brother (who also reads this with me) asked me who Rock Lee and Neji were. The characters that do matter are often cliche and even boring. There is the main character who falls very easily into the shonen mainstream hero archetype, there is the angry child archetype, the girl who has a crush archetype, and the wise teacher archetype. Enjoyment (5): Although the story was not very great and the characters were terrible, at the end of the day the product was still somewhat enjoyable. The main reason why was because of the fight scenes and the fact that you get to see MAGICAL NINJAS FIGHTING. If that isn't an awesome setup for spectacular fight scenes, then I do not know what is. However, the really boring and generic story, the boring characters, and the nothing that often happened in an arc puts this score down quite a bit. TLDR? Pros: *The fight sequences are spectacular *Good soundtrack with the fight scenes *Chuunin Exam arc has remained up to date one of the best shounen arcs I have seen *The humor can be funny as a pick-me-up. Cons: *Terrible Story - Much deus ex machina (plot no jutsu) writing, or writing that feels as though it were made up in the last moment, and there are few plot holes. The plot holes are faulted slightly less by the fact that any story this long will probably have at least one plot hole. *The length of the story is far too long. It loses much charm and interest after such long periods of time. After a while you lose immersion. *Much filler (doesn't really apply to the manga or to those who skip filler so it does not have much minus on the review) *Very cliche characters, and the minor characters who were fan favorites become completely irrelevant to the point where they could be nonexistent and nothing would change. *Themes are not depicted well, especially with the black-white morality. It feels as though whoever wins the battle has the correct viewpoint which is narrow-minded. *Plot often feels repetitive, just about everyone has lost somebody close to them in the past and have decided to become the villain because of that. *The pacing is inconsistent. At times you'll be going down a rollercoaster ride having a character learn much at one time, other times Naruto will be yelling Sasuke's name and looking for him in a fruitless attempt to reconcile. *The humor can also get in the way of the story. At times, the tone will be feeling more serious, but when comic relief (beyond a chuckle) happens the atmosphere is broken, immersion is lost, and you lost the chance of taking that scene very seriously. Overall Score: 5.5/10 (Just round it up to 6/10) ***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it.

"Covering the 2nd half of Naruto manga, Shippuden adapts the teenaged years of the titular character. I wanna start this review by admitting that I am quite thankful there were people who managed to really enjoy the full road Shippuden brings. It's a long one, 500 episodes counting filler and around 300 even if you aren't. It took me 5 months to get through all the material skipping everything filler related. Now, it's actually been quite a while since I finished Shippuden (finished it last November) but I feel with a clearer head now's a better time than ever to go over everything with the series. I enjoyed very little of Naruto Shippuden. To start with, Naruto is... Well, not a very fun protagonist to say the least. He starts off the series seeming at least a little more mature and less annoying than his original counterpart but as the series goes on his character takes a complete nosedive and it was hard for me to really enjoy him as a character by the end. His obsession with getting Sasuke back (who at the end of Naruto abandoned the Hidden Leaf to join that series' big bad in a move that would've potentially ended with his death), while understandable, feels completely unbelievable and unjustified. I feel this could've been corrected by exploring both characters similarities (which happens... 470 episodes in...) But for the majority of the series the goal of bringing back Sasuke feels so hard to care about. Another one of the main characters I enjoyed very little of was Sakura. Sakura is actually just not good. Her character in the previous series, while annoying and mostly unlikable, made sense. She was the most realistic of the cast, reacting to events how an actual 12 year old girl would in the events. Her treatment of Naruto and obsession over Sasuke back then felt understandable and it led me not to really dislike her much. Enter Shippuden Sakura. She starts off fairly well with some new abilities (becoming stronger plus learning to heal from Tsunade). However this only lasts for one story arc as by the second story arc she's reverted back to her old ways fairly quickly, rarely amounting to much in the story. She gets one cool moment towards the end of the Ninja World War when Team 7 reunities but not only is the scene poorly built up, aside from landing a good blow to the final villain she doesn't do too much. As a character her interactions with Naruto are dreadful. Really amounting to nothing more than Sakura deriding Naruto for being stupid, praising him for managing to do things despite that or maybe sometimes a little bit of hero worship. However she hits her absolute lowest as a character anytime something involves Sasuke. Her little childhood crush never goes away and while it doesn't seem to bad, the 5 Kage Summit arc is just... Well lemme explain. Once Sasuke is officially labeled a rouge ninja which means he must be eradicated, the majority of the original Genin kids (Sans Naruto and of course Sasuke) decide that'll it'll be up to them to take care of Sasuke. Sakura however decides to fight him on her own. I didn't mind this because it shows a small semblance of character development. However she struggles to do so due to still being in love with him and honestly she is unable to hold a candle to a weaker Sasuke (having just killed a man after all). I find it very disappointing and really dumb of Sakura. Otherwise, the cast of characters in this series is VERY expansive but good luck seeing them on screen at all. Older characters that could use development or could be used in new arcs end up getting replaced with new characters who serve on simple purpose and then usually get put on a bus and forgotten anyways. Heya Sai, Taka members. The one exception to this is Shikamaru, the only member of the original Konoha 12 that isn't Naruto or Sasuke who continues to develop. He actually gets his own story arc, the first story arc in the anime to actually be above ""meh"" level. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good. Otherwise, the cast of characters is mostly dreadful in this arc. However I will admit: even many months later Shippuden has some great villains. Wasn't big on Orochimaru in the original series, so the amount of good villains actually surprised me. Whether they be mini-bosses like Hidan, Kakazu, that one guy who flies on a clay bird and uses explosives (forgot his name my bad) or Itachi. The bigger bads are definitely some of the best though. Pain and Obito are still my two favorite anime antagonists. Kinda surprising considering my thoughts on the rest of the series so far... Though to be honest I still don't like Madara. He's not really bad, just very basic imo. That being said, what about the story. *Large exhale* The story isn't bad when it starts off if I'm gonna be honest, but they aren't really all that great either. I felt very little reason to care about the story, a thing which I blame on it's characters. It's not until a major character dies around 70 episodes in where I actually found myself getting invested in the series. Episode 81 (The Episode titled ""Team 10"" is one of the most well directed anime episodes I believe. From there on the series begins to start getting back to original Naruto levels of decent. Sasuke's fight with Itachi, the reveal of Pain, many major plot events all culminating in ""The Pain Invasion"" as Naruto becomes the last objective of the Akatsuki's hit list. While overall the arc tends to become quite frustrating (One notable thing being that Naruto isn't around for most of the invasion, training in another dimension, which is something that could actually work in the other characters advantage as Naruto's capture would mean the end of the world. However Tsunade objects, wanting Naruto to be apart of the fight which is a bad idea in every way knowing how more experienced fighters lost to Pain and Naruto is a 16 year old). However the fight between Naruto and Pain makes up for it. A battle between two different ideas of peace with some amazing animation and Naruto's subsequent breakdown towards the end I'd quite heartbreaking. However, at the very end Naruto simply talks Pain out of his evil ways turning him good. While this is a fairly common Naruto story element and on that I defend in fact, it was poorly implimented and was the beginning of the final downfall of Shippuden. I could go on about the Fourth Great Ninja War arc but it's fairly lengthy (About 2/3's of the whole anime) and so a rant would probably be quite long. Overall the plot sets itself up as interesting but nothing interesting actually happens. I found more often the not I'd either be anticipating a singular event that was to take place in the story, or just straight up anticipating the arcs ending. Can I also talk about the series' animation? The art design becomes a lot softer and more exaggerated as the series continues, which I appreciate. However for the most part the characters look and move stiffly no matter where the series is. Every now and then the series gets its best animators on a single episode (mostly fights with spectacular results see Sakura vs Sasori, Sasuke vs Deidara and Naruto vs Sasuke) but this is only 5% of a 500 episode anime. The show looks DREADFUL through and throughout I can say though: Its soundtrack is phenomenal. Probably my favorite or second favorite soundtrack. It's a little weak at the start but by the end of the ninja world war it really hits its peak. Honestly what can I say about Shippuden. It really hurt to get through and unless there's some sort of Shippuden Kai, I'm never watching this series again. Oh, but one thing before I finish this review. Don't forget how the series tore down it's whole heartwarming idea that hard work will pay off. Naruto, who was always played up as the underdog who came from nothing, turned out to be not only the chosen one, but was also related the VARIOUS strong individuals from the past (1st Hokages wife is his ancestor. Son of the 4th Hokage. Reincarnation of ninja Jesus etc). *Sigh* Why Kishimoto... Why...",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 25, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_b26b5b9b92,4
"So it goes like this - Akatsuki a criminal organization of rogue ninjas is on the move to capture all the jinchurikis. Naruto is on the move to bring Sasuke back. Sasuke is on the move to kill his brother Itachi who is an Akatsuki member. Other characters are inconsequential in the eyes of the writer. There are a whole lot of problems with this series but the main problem is Naruto himself. Why would he go so far to bring back a dick like Sasuke who does not give a shit about him or any other person. Naruto completely sidesteps his ambition to become a hokage. His new goal is to bring back Sasuke. Why the hell is Sasuke so important? For this series to work Sasuke should have been a real great guy who was loved by and who was a real hero but Sasuke is a self centered dick,piece of shit,asshole. The only persons who care about Sasuke are Naruto and Sakura and it is an established fact that both of them are retarded. So the main problem with me is the motivation of the hero which is completely illogical. The second problem is the hero itself. Naruto is a weak person. He has had his balls removed. He is a self pitying piece of shit who cries on a drop of a hat , who treats important people like shit and sucks up to Sasuke. It would have been great if the hero had been a guy like Edward Elric because Ed also has a tendency to get emotional and well up but no one can call him a sissy pants. However the most excruciating aspect of the series is its pacing. It just goes on and on and on. It eats up a whole episode to do something which requires merely 5 - 6 mins. There are flashbacks to remind you about what happened five minutes ago and this also happens during action sequences which kills the momentum and intensity which is already lacking. Finally I am so angry because I think this series had so much more potential. It throws you into a complex and interesting world of ninjas but focuses on the faggots - narusasu. It gives us awesome characters like Kakashi and Ero Sennin and sidesteps them completely. They should have been the heroes. It also treats female characters like shit and portrays them as worthless (Sakura' Ten Ten,Hinata) ***THAT IS ALL END OF RANT***",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 14, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0754b94850,4
"I would like to let people know that this anime is awesome and i grew up watching it. If your wondering why the overall is only 4 is because the creators are complete jerks. They are able to make masterpiece episodes but they have utterly no respect for their fans. Half of an entire season is fillers that are irrelevant to the main story. I watch this anime to see the great action and story following Naruto and his friends. Not some imagined on the spot character that brings up a over-dramatic life. They take more ""breaks"" than they make episodes. Just recently they came back to the main story after a few months of fillers i have no interest in but just after that one main episode they decide to take a few weeks for a break, then they did it again.. and again.. and again. I use to see stores with anime fan toys and souvenirs, They prohibited all their merchandise and decided to monopolize it at a overpriced retail. I wish some other company would take over naruto and bring out its full potential instead of soliciting ratings from millions of students and swimming in their pools of yen.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 26, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_de915ebbf0,4
"I was all into this show back when I was was in middle school. At some point later, this show was moving too slow for me so i started going with it through the manga releases. Eventually I ran out of time and lost rhythm with the anime. I ended up finishing the manga version though. I already know what happens story wise. This manga is too slow paced and long winded. They could of made this show happen in 250 episodes combined. Both naruto and shippuuden. Instead it became a cash cow and quality suffered. It could be I fell out of love with this show because perhaps my tastes changed as I got older. It was one of my favorite shows when I first started watching it. Then when at some point during high school it just didn't attract me, it ended up feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyment. Story wise it started out good, then became way too repetitive and predictable. They drag things out for no reason. Its not like this show will make you think on a deeper level. The plot is basically what you would expect for a shonen anime. Nothing artistic or out of the ordinary. Overall, i would give this anime a 6/10.

"Naruto Shippuuden As you probably Know From Other Reviews, Is A continuation From The original Series &quot;Naruto&quot;, The Difference is That it takes place a few years later, When naruto is Somewhat More mature. OverAll I'd have To say that Shippuuden has to be WAY better then the original Naruto Series, not To Mention More Action Packed. There also Tends To Be less Fillers Then there was in the First Naruto Series, At the Same Time I Believe Even If Most Fillers are completly retarded, that they are Necessarily Because Without Them We Would catch up to the manga, and if we catch up with the manga, Episodes would be delayed like crazy (Just Like our Friend inuyasha). Think About it We're currently 90 Chapters Behind them, And i'd say about 3-4 chapters are in each episode. That leaves around 30 or Less Weeks. at the same time, If We're going at 3 chapters a week, and they're going at 1 chapter a week, without fillers or DELAYS, We would catch up in almost no time at all! Overall Despite The Similar Story For Every Filler, i Would Give this Anime an 8 Out Of 10",8,Recommended,"Sep 28, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_29d1cdd6d1,4
"Naruto Shippuden is the long awaited sequel of Naruto. Naruto is a good anime that's why it's no wonder why it became so popular,however Naruto Shippuden ruined it. Story: 4/10 Naruto Shippuden started off really good, at least it didn't failed everyone's expectation after the long wait. It was nice to see Naruto and the rest grew up as teenagers -with their new missions and new journey. However... as the series continue, the story started to get messed up and slowly went downhill. The story started to focus more on Naruto and Sasuke's relationship - on how Naruto wanted to keep his promise to Sakura and bring Sasuke back. The fights took so long, not because a fierce fight was going on but because of the long talks during the fight. Art: 2/10 The characters doesn't look as good as before. The animation is also really bad, it looks so dull. There were fight scenes that could've been great to watch, but because of bad animation, it became boring to watch. There are also times when the characters look distorted -especially during fight scenes. Character: 6/10 Nothing much has change from the characters...except: Some old characters that we thought of as cool ended up doing nothing really helpful and ended up like side characters. There are new interesting characters but the attention for them slowly fade. The are lots of characters that wasn't given the attention and development that they deserve. Overall: 3/10 It is really sad... how a good series ended up being disappointing",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 31, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_49c62b35d0,4
"This is one of those childhood anime that is full of memories, but after I watched it thoroughly, I decided not to recommend this anime. The reason is simple, there are too many flashbacks in each episode, this is the worst motive for stalling time in my opinion. there are a lot of useless episodes but most of them are filled with flashbacks which are very long, long, very long and even take up several episodes. I don't have a problem with flashbacks from each character, but the problem is the positioning, for example, I was enjoying watching Naruto fight but suddenly I met another character and the flashback started, seriously? The worst thing was the flashback of Sakura saying to bring Sasuke back, I was really tired of hearing that, I don't know how many times I had to hear Sakura's cries for help! So in conclusion, this anime is good, but there are many negative points, especially for flashbacks, imperfect placement, as long as you put flashbacks anywhere, In other words, this anime is too fixated on flashbacks, really badly, and what's worse is that the same flashback is played again in other episodes, only with a few scenes added, and this applies to other flashbacks. This should have added the Drama genre, because it's a lot more crap compared to action.",6,Not Recommended,"Oct 9, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_40eb896375,4
"Inconsistent the whole way, even when it comes to its strengths. - Naruto is sometimes his entertaining and cheeky self from before the timeskip, other times he's just a goody two shoes protagonist. - Sometimes the dialogue is very solid, but other times it falls off the deep end (sometimes even in the same conversation). - The animation can be anything from appalling to passable, occasionally being amazing. - Some story arcs are really engaging and fun, others feel like filler. - Sometimes, the filler episodes feel canon (Itachi's backstory) while some canon episodes feel like filler (anything involving Sai). - The story felt consistent and cohesive the entire way, except at the very end where they create plot holes out of thin air for absolutely no reason. - The show explores a lot of interesting themes, but some of them get completely butchered (such as hard work vs talent) - The climax is butchered only to be saved and then butchered again immediately. - Sometimes the show nails something you would never imagine, but then completely flop on very obvious things. The one thing I can grant Naruto Shippuuden is that it has the best villains I have seen in any series. There's such a wide variety of villains and they are all interesting in their own specific way. Every villain seems to have their own motives, and the best thing is that all the motives are believable. Skip the filler, but also understand that a lot of the time will be miserable, but there will be some very strong arcs and moments. If you prefer a consistent, entertaining experience, this may not be it. However, if you think strong moments are worth waddling through the mud, you might like it.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 4, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_420f5d23eb,4

"Naruto Shippuuden, the sequel to Naruto, finally resumes the main story after endless amounts of filler. Some people say that this is the worst anime ever while there are also some other people who say that this is the best anime ever. After catching up to the latest episode, I can safely say that this is not the best anime and it is also not the worst anime ever. Story : 7/10 Now before you start watching this show make sure that you must watch the prequel as you will not understand a single thing without watching the prequel. The show begins with Naruto returning to his village , Konohagakure after 3 years of training with the legendary sannin Jiraiya. He looks stronger , taller and more muscular however he has not learn any new jutsu at all even after training for THREE YEARS. The organization , Akatsuki has also began to take action as they are starting to take action as they are slowly kidnapping the Jinchurikis for their plan. A new dark threat lies ahead and also Orochimaru is also planning to make Sasuke his new vessel and Naruto must save him from it before it happens. Now the story is pretty standard and good however the only thing that makes me frustrated is that there are always fillers that makes you think what the hell is this? What is the point of showing this? If only there are no fillers and freaking 10 minute flashbacks that always happen frequently this show would have been definitely less than 400 episodes.However, if you remove all the fillers and flashbacks, you will have a fantastic story which is filled with great action and some of the saddest scenes I have ever seen. Unfortunately the story is overshadowed by huge amount of fillers that is just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, there were some fillers that were just plain awesome such as the Kakashi anbu arc which is a must watch. Art : 7/10 The art of Naruto Shippuuden is definitely a lot better than its prequel. There were some ups and downs which there were some episodes which the art just looked plain weird but there were some episodes in which the art looked fantastic (Episode 322). Overall the art is average and there is really nothing much to complain or admire about. Sound : 7/10 The soundtrack for Naruto Shippuuden is pretty fantastic. There were some ost that I listen to frequently (Pain's theme). The openings and endings are pretty average as there were some which is so awesome (opening 6 and 16) and there were some that were just plain awful. Overall the soundtrack is pretty decent as there were nothing to complain about. Character : 9/10 The characters are the keypoint and the best part of the show. Each and every character always has enough depth and background which shows you why are they doing this. Naruto Uzumaki has really received so much character development and has grown from a young kid who loves to pull pranks to a strong and dependable adult. The supporting characters are all fantastic and amazing especially Uchiha Itachi and the Fourth Hokage who are both just plain awesome. My only complain about the characters is Sakura Haruno who at first looks like she has become stronger and more independent but as the story progressed, you can see that the author just doesn't give a crap about her and makes her do all the annoying things. Hell the only thing she did was yell either Naruto or Sasuke's name. The fillers character were also just annoying. For example there was this kid who keeps talking about his home which annoyed me to no end. Despite me complaining so much about the characters the characters were really great and it was really entertaining to watch them do the things they do. Enjoyment : 6/10 To be honest I really enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden main story but when it comes to the fillers all my excitement goes down the drain and I just multitask while watching it. For example the current episode is also a filler which seriously pissed me off as they just showed an incredible twist then boom they suddenly show a flashback about a story which I don't give a damn about. Well the show is really enjoyable when it comes to the main plot. Overall : 7/10 Overall Naruto Shippuuden has its ups and downs. Hell I cried like a baby so many times at some scenes which were incredibly sad. I also had goosebumps at some scenes which were just plain awesome. Naruto Shippuden is definitely a lot more mature and better than it's prequel and best part of all is that people actually die in this anime. Such a pity that the large amount of fillers and flashbacks really drags this show down as if they remove the flashbacks and fillers from the show, I would have given this show a 9/10.

"I've seen all the episodes broadcast so far, what I can say is that it confirms the expectations I had of this anime, which is one of the best ever made. Past the filler, the series opens in new facets in an incredible way, and the story begins to take hold, smooth as glass with great skill, as it happens in the manga. The only criticism that I can relate to the graphics, which compared to the first series has dropped in quality, not much is clear, however, an improvement was due at least as quality goes the others Anime. The sound, I would say that there are not equal, along with Bleach, I think they are the best soundtracks ever made for an anime, there are no words to describe the great and splendid quality of the music that accompany the anime. There is everything in Naruto, comedy, drama, spectacular fights, psychology ... I repeat, nothing is missing. For this reason I think it is superior to all other anime of its kind, even when compared to giants like Dragon Ball. The last comment: Although perfection does not exist, I put 10 because I saw that the negative votes were the result of the insertion of filler which in effect have created much discussion, I shared it too, but it seems too fall into exasperation, because they are interesting and related to story. STORY: The story starts from the drain Sasuke. The protagonist in the meantime has to train to be able to bring home his friend and defend himself against Akatsuki, an organization that wants to capture all the devils with tails, also it is precisely in this series that you discover many secrets, like the story of Uchiha’s clan or Naruto’s parents. CHARACTERS: here are introduced to new characters very well characterized, especially the Akatsuki’s members. FIGHTS: here fights are a bit longer and made much better than the first series, in some cases are even epic.",9,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9b2938660f,4
"Naruto is my favorite anime so this review will be a long one. If I had to describe Naruto in just one sentence, I would say, ""An Epic Journey of Ninjas, Friendship, and Self-Discovery."" This masterpiece not only offers epic and thrilling battles but also presents rich and profound character development, engaging storytelling, and a lasting message of perseverance and friendship. As someone who grew up following Naruto, this journey was more than just an anime - it was a fundamental part of my own growth journey. Let's start with the fights. Naruto is widely recognized for its intense and exciting battles, skillfully choreographed and full of thrilling twists. From the epic clashes between Naruto and Sasuke to battles against threats like Pain and Madara, each fight is an action masterpiece that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. However, the true heart of Naruto lies in its character development. Throughout the series, we witness the growth and evolution not only of the protagonist but also of a diverse cast of characters such as Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, each with their own emotional struggles and journeys. In particular, Naruto's transformation from an undisciplined and lonely kid into a full-grown man and hero is inspiring and emotional. His dream of becoming Hokage is not just a personal ambition but a testament to the power of hard work and determination to overcome adversity. His unwavering determination and indomitable spirit serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for viewers, teaching valuable lessons about hard work, friendship, and self-discovery along the way. Furthermore, Naruto is rich in universal themes such as love, loss, redemption, and sacrifice. Moments of humor and camaraderie are balanced with moments of great emotion and drama, creating a truly captivating and multifaceted viewing experience. The fact that I grew up following Naruto makes this journey even more meaningful to me. As Naruto faced challenges and overcame obstacles, I was also going through my own experiences of growth and learning. Through his struggles and triumphs, I found inspiration and courage to face real-life challenges. In summary, Naruto is more than just an anime - it's an exciting and inspiring journey that resonates deeply with viewers. If you haven't watched it yet, I encourage you to embark on this life-changing adventure.",10,Recommended,"Mar 26, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f98e435b31,4

"It's 2 and a half years since Naruto left to train with the Legendary Sanin Juraiya. You'd expect him to be bad*** right? Guess again. Naruto is still the goofy little kid who still gets his *** handed to him in every fight. What exactly has he learned? No new jutsu to be sure, just learning to control his Kyuuba. That sounds cool but it's really not. This lies a problem with character growth. It's nonexistant in shippuuden until around episode 50 (avoiding spoilers). Naruto still wants to find Sasuke. Guess what? SASUKE WILL NVR COME BACK, GET THAT THROUGH YOU'RE THICK SKULL!!!!! Another problem is the story. Shippy progresses too slowly. Half an episode is just talking, the other half is the slow fighting. It will literally take 5 minutes just for someone to punch the other guy. And the flashbacks are just silly. Why do I need a flashback for something that happened 5 minutes ago? This has happened quite a few times. The character designs aren't bad except Ino's. She looks like a Britney Spears wannabe and who'd wanna be her? I gave Naruto shippuuden a 7, but my review makes me sound like I hate it which is not true. Shippuuden actually has a deep story. If it progressed fast it'd be epic. More about the Akatsuki's goals are revealed and when a fight actually occurs it can become an awsome fight. Naruto Shippuuden also has a different animation style to it that I enjoy. It sets the mood for a dark and deep story which I enjoy. I gave it a 7 because when something good happens it becomes REALLY awsome.

"I really, really, REALLY tried to like this show. I was a fan of Naruto (the prequel to Shippuden) and I really enjoyed it.... but trying to finish this show was as fun as watching seniors play checkers. SERIOUSLY. Story: Ehhh it was same old Naruto plots and stories. Easily predictable and boring. Some friend is in a pickle and Naruto goes all emotional to save him even if he met that that guy 2 minutes ago, because he wants to be hokage. Yawn. I saw enough of that in Naruto. Basically, if you watched Naruto and liked it, think of it as the same thing... minus the excitement. Art: It was no eye popper, but it surely was no total trash. The action and fighting scenes are still eye candy for actionholics, but other than that, it pretty much is what you'd call standard Naruto animation. Sound: The sound is possibly the best part of Naruto Shippuden. The OPs are still great, expected from Naruto, and the endings weren't that shabby either... Shooting Star (the first ending) grew to be one of my most favorite endings of all time. Character: All the characters show some development... but in an easily predictable way. Naruto ends up a BIT mature, Sakura grows ladylike... at least for her, and Sasuke grows to be more of a bastard than in Naruto. Some new faces pop up now and then... but they are as memorable as the dust in your belly button. Enjoyment: Now this is where the opinions get diverse. Some Narutoholics will say this is that best thing since Spam and some will say that they watch this show at night just to go to sleep. I'm no Narutoholic so I'd say that the enjoyment for this show is just horrible, but it will be a way for you to waste time if you can get through all the predictable plotlines. Overall: Naruto Shippuden could be, should be, and WILL BE a huge disappointment for Naruto fans who enjoyed the show out of pure action enjoyment. But of course they say that 60% of Naruto watchers end up dying their hair yellow out of love for this show, so it all depends on how you look at Naruto. But overall, Naruto Shippuden isn't something you'd go crazy for. Take my word for it. Overall:",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 20, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_53ce98419d,4
"Tl;dr: This title is a masterpiece, but with the excessive volume and poor quality of the filler episodes, watching the filler destroys any prolonged enjoyment. This show starts out delivering a 10/10 experience right out of the gate. Its a more mature Naruto with some great villains and a story that keeps on delivering. The anime however falls into the ""we don't have enough content"" category and consistently pushes arc after arc of terrible filler that is by far some of the worst of any show. I don't know why the quality drops so much but it just does. When the show is on manga content it delivers superb animation with great character and scene design, top notch voice acting and music, and an excellent plot with character development. Where I am now with watching the show (roughly episode 415) nearly 30-40% of the show has been filler and the current story line shows 1 or 2 episodes from the manga then goes off on a filler flashback tangent for 10-20 episodes, then back to 1 episode of actual story, then back to another 10 episodes of filler garbage. Specifically right now, we're on our 3rd (maybe 4th) flashback on the same character. I can't stress that enough, we're on the 4th filler line for one specific character and they don't even try to hide that they have 1) no more ideas for original story, and 2) they've transplanted Naruto's character and personality into the other character's past. So basically we're watching Naruto, if Naruto was another character, in the same village. It is a complete degradation of the story back to the original Naruto series before this title grew out of the childish plots and ploys that made that show work, but also makes me never want to return to it again. Awful. I don't have much hope for this pulling any higher than a 6/10 for me at this point. If you had asked me 100 episodes ago if I thought that I would rate this show any less than a 10, I'd tell you that you were out of your mind...

"Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable. Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination. Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation.

"Given the voracity of the backlash against the ""not-so-bad"" rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance. So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality. The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke's blandness and Naruto's charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level. The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed. It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn't saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto's Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about. How one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn't too much here that I haven't seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom. In closing, Naruto, while being better than worse without a doubt, doesn't quite succeed in being as mind-blowing as the hype-machine would have you believe. This anime volleys between a two-star and a four-star feature depending upon your anime viewing mileage and how easily you can stomach an anime so action laden. If you are relatively new to anime and a fan of DragonBall Z and YuYu Hakusho, it is a four-star feature. Otherwise, this is a three-star series at best",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 19, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_75044d0a25,5
"The series brings some new things, and repeats some old weaknesses to the storytelling. I'm assuming that anyone reading this has seen at least some of the original series, so please do so if you have not before reading this. Story: Just as there was a timeskip and gap between series in the anime, the author took a slight break between the two series too. Which places the studio in an awkward position of when to start releasing the anime series and what pace to set. Afterall, the reason for almost 100 filler episodes in the original series was to give the manga author time to work. Even then they are catching up frighteningly fast and are already beginning to ""pepper"" in a couple of filler arcs. Unlike the old filler arcs however, these segue nicely into the original plot and don't stand out as much as the old ones did. As for what happens, it picks up as Naruto returns to Konoha after 2 and a half years of training with Jiraiya. I will say that I'm somewhat dissappointed with how little he's improved. Pervy Sage must be a slack-off because the other characters seem to have improved a lot more than Naruto has (even though he's all around stronger, faster, etc.). He's matured a little, but of course that leaves room for improvement. As Jiraiya stated before filler hell settled in during the first series, he intended them to return right as Akatsuki would begin to move and Sasuke's life would be in potential danger. That prediction is dead on as after he is back less than a day Akatsuki begins it's quest to capture all the ""jinchuriki"" (ninja who have tailed beasts within them) starting with Gaara. You can go on your own from there. Art: The world seems less...fresh than it did in the first series. They, so far mind you, have stuck to the seemingly endless woods around Konoha and a brief foray in the lands of the Sand Village (Sonagakure). The difference in character design is fascinating, all due to the original author of course. Both Sai and Yamato are intriguing for their lack of distinguishing features. While all the other characters are as notable for their looks as their personalities. Of course all the original young ninja have matured, all hanging around ~15 yo by the looks of things. The differences are largely subtle and well done. Sound: This is the biggest letdown. Not because it's poor quality, but because it's always the same 3 tracks playing. There is no variety in music and the same ""Battle/danger"" music plays all the time. The variety of music from the first series is gone and that is sad because the original Naruto has an excellent soundtrack. Character: Naruto is much the same, but tempered with maturity in that he is able to understand others (except Sakura of course) much better. He is still obsessed with rescuing Sasuke, and is still reckless and rash. He seems especially stagnated in comparison to the others who have all become Chunin and even Jonin. Naruto does show maturity when he learns that Gaara has not only surpassed him but has achieved his own goal by coming Kazekage of his village (though it's later revealed it was for political reasons). Sakura has changed the most. One of my fav moments from the new series is how she actually becomes interested in Naruto (noting his physique has matured) but is quickly disuaded by discovering his lack of ""coolness"" (aka bragging about a ""new"" sexy jutsu to Konahamaru and telling her that she looked the same (she's ""filled out"" BTW)). Due to 9 tailed fox's increased power within Naruto, and the fact that they are lacking Sasuke, Tsunade assigns two former ANBU members to join their squad (Kakashi ends up back in the hospital right away of course). They are Yamato and Sai. Yamato is the result of one of Orochimaru's experiments, which gives him the powers of the first Hokage. These are the power of wood element (he can build a mansion in seconds) and limited control over tailed beasts, namely the nine-tailed fox by using the pendant that Tsunade gave Naruto. Frequently they play off his amazingly blank face. Naruto, and the viewers for that matter, find his face kinda eerie at times. They don't hesitate to have fun with this. He's very kind-hearted though and looks up to Kakashi, calling him Senpai (implying that he served under him in ANBU. (note: Yamato is not his real name, but he continues to use it) Sai, is originally planted in the group by Danzo, the leader of ANBU root and Tsunade's political nemesis within Konoha. Trained not to show any emotion, he eventually begins to respond to Naruto and the others. He provides a lot of comic relief by trying to interract with the others. Enjoyment: It's not as groundbreaking as the orignal, but the series continues to be fun. Naruto continues to grow and mature over the (now 100 episodes) series and is even learning to better use his current jutsus, thanks to Kakashi actually involving himself in Naruto's training for the first time. The gags continue a lot but now that characters are actually dying (other than enemies or the elderly (3rd Hokage) it's gotten more serious as well. Overall: The series has a long ways to go, and since the author is far from finished it will be interesting how they decide to keep pace. They are currently on their 2nd filler arc. The first was somewhat silly, but gave everyone background on Asuma which is very important for reasons I refuse to give away at this time. The 2nd seems to be explaining where the 3-tails jinchuriki came from so it'll be interesting to see how they handle it. Of course the original story is very strong and fast paced. To this date the highlight of the series has definately been when Naruto takes on Orochimaru. It helps you appreciate just how strong Orochimaru is. The battles with the Akatsuki have been fascinating, mostly because they have so few weaknesses and how hard the Konoha ninja have to work to defeat them.",7,Recommended,"Mar 29, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4e80370bb7,5
"Note: Review has been suitably edited to match my views on the anime as of present time. Will have spoilers. You've been warned. -I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some errors. Please accept my apology.- Naruto or Naruto Shippuuden? If I were to compare naruto and naruto shippuuden, somewhere down the line I would still prefer the former. Although I accept naruto shippuden has better fight scenes, the disappointing twists and turns have multiplied considerably too. Characters: Naruto shippuuden has an army of fans for a reason, and one of the biggest reason is this - the characters. Almost all types of people will find atleast one lovable character in this series, not to mention there are so many! In naruto there are no outright good or bad guys. Almost every character is very believable although sometimes they tend to get repetitive (spoiler >> all those ""healed"" by naruto pretty much have the same sob history as him. Gaara, pein..why?) Character development: The leads: The thing I find irritating about the series is that sasuke is hyped too much. (haven't we had enough of mourning for sasuke while the characters grew up?) ..and yet he is nowhere to be seen. I'd prefer if the entire series stops going hush hush about him and actually have him take up proper screen space for once. The ""mystery"" charm is not working anymore, in fact its getting irritating. In the recent episodes, naruto's significance has considerably increased which makes me happy because to me it somewhat always felt like naruto as the lead was being sidelined a bit. A character's importance is not entirely calculated by his screen space. He has grown up wonderfully after his recent encounters with akatsuki, and for once something in naruto made me feel all happy like the good ol' naruto series. Sasuke, he seems to be really strong now after training for years under Orochimaru but much can't be said as the anime hasn't progressed so far. The manga is another ball, ofcourse. Although on personal or emotional level (whatever way you like to see it) he still remains the b@st@rd who will not even twitch for a split second before tossing naruto's feelings aside; who along with sakura is still ever so determined to bring him back home. Such level of coldness for someone who loves and cares for you so much is not ""cool"", its outright irritating. The third and probably the most criticised one, sakura, is a complete contrast from her old days now. While the heartache of losing sasuke is still there, she's become a gem of a medical ninja AND has the much in/famous montrous strength inherited from Tsunade; which is impressive. I don't mind if she's not in the war zone fighting, as long as she is good in what she's doing which she is, so even though I didn't like sakura initially; I do not completely agree to her being criticized now. I just hope they give her more significant role to play. Also, her relation with naruto has developed considerably and in a good way. The side sicks: spoiler >>One thing I find really irritating with this series is that every character you start liking meets an unexpected end, and not in a good way. Sasuke is TEH GOD, naruto is the broken hearted kid in distress and sakura..well she still exists. Not that I have any grudge against sasuke, infact he used to be one of my favourites in naruto series; but I think there are far too many good characters with great potential in the series that are majorly sidelined while sasuke is being hyped to the level that it left some fans irritated. (Again I must go back to the point that if he is so important then don't have almost 100 episodes with pretty much no screen presence of him at all! Talk less and show more is what I want to say, and minus the army of fangirls if at all possible.) Akatsuki: SPOILERZZZZZZ!! What excited me most about naruto shippuudin is akatsuki. What excited me most about the entire naruto universe ever since I came to know something like akatsuki existed is AKATSUKI. When they were finally introduced, I was nearly ready to shed tears of joy. I guess that was one of the very rare fangirlish moment I had in my life as an otaku. But the way it happened made my jaw fall on the floor. With disappointment, that is. They make an awesome character like hidan, and he pretty much (almost) dies with not even one ""proper"" fight. It left me utterly frustated. And I just couldn't understand someone like kakuzu who survived a fight the great you-know-who got his ass handed to him just like that by naruto. Okay, naruto got stronger and all that but still, the transition was a bit too sudden for me to believe. As for sasori I really can't complain because what happened was no surprise (and one thing .. please he did not get owned by sakura. I find it so hard to believe why people keep forgetting that someone who actually knew so much about him was there too!! Defeat was only natural).. but I'd have been really happy if he had made a come back or something. Whatever, illogical demands.. heh. Anime progress: Another blooper is the progress of anime. With animes where anime and manga have become quite close, frequent fillers are acceptable and NEEDED. But naruto manga is like..zillion light years away from the anime then what is the need of such slow progress? I dropped naruto at ep 100 due to its slow progress and temporarily switched to other animes. Once it gains its pace, being a narutard I'm; I'll most likely be lured into watching naruto again. Animation: Something is wrong with naruto's quality, its not just the same anymore. The anatomy sometimes is horribly wrong .. to the point that you're able to notice it even when something really interesting is going on. The jumping from trees to trees scenes almost always look like people are flying, and some things just don't make sense anymore. Considering that the anime takes its own sweet time in progressing compared to manga, this type of quality is a major setback to fans but if you're a narutard fear not. You'll pretty much still be glued to this anime no matter how bad it gets. Sound: I'm one of those people who don't get bothered a lot by sound unless its so off to the point that its ruining the scene so I pretty much find the sounds okay. The openings and ending except one or two aren't all that great compared to other animes but still fine. The biggest setback.. fansub: This is not important and perhaps not related.. but while I'm at it why not cover this too? We all know dattebayo, if you don't then you probably don't watch naruto and shouldn't be reading this review because its full of spoilers. Anyway, the biggest setback came to me when crunchyroll took up naruto leading dattebayo to drop it. My source of watching HQ naruto was lost because DB won't sub it, crunchyroll won't air it for our country because its licensed here and I won't get to see it because for whatever xyz reasons CR doesn't know, NARUTO IS NOT ON SALE HERE! Shipping from abroad costs more than the actual anime, which is obviously not an option. And its not just me, a huge chuck of anime fans in my country stopped watching naruto for the same reason after DB dropped it. In a nutshell, I think naruto shippuuden is a good anime with outstanding characters, but not-so-good priorities and balance between characters. Neverthless, it still deserves at least one time watch. Its one of the most popular anime of today's time, reviews only matter upto a limit.. don't they?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 7, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e53cbee83b,5
"A much more ambitious continuation to its predecessor. Introduces brand new concepts, expands on lore, and keeps up with the themes of bonds/friendship and ending the cycle of hatred. Though it has some pacing issues and polarizing decision-making at times, this remains a favourite series to many for its climactic fights, emotional moments and diverse cast of characters. While the original series is definitely more cohesive and grounded, Shippuden has much higher highs. No beating around the bush, it is a flawed show, but the positives outweigh the negatives and offer some of the most iconic sequences in anime history. Additionally, Naruto: Shippuden covers a wide range of genres throughout its 500 episode run. There is something for everyone from dazzling fight animation to romantic subplots to fleshed-out side character stories. All in all, this is an absolute must watch for fans of the original series and the universe it's set in.

"Naruto...one of the most popular anime to ever be created, and one of the big players in mainstream shonen anime. Regardless of whether you love Naruto or hate it, you have to admit it did something right -- nothing can get this popular while being very bad. Story -- 9 The story of Naruto is probably the best and worst quality of this anime. It's built around the complex world of ninjas (shinobi) that is very carefully crafted with hundreds of characters, tons of ninja abilities (jutsus), and an immersive system of countries/villages. All this creates an almost surreal realistic effect. The amount of work it takes to actually become well versed in all of Naruto-dom is a lot, but anyone that watches the 400+ episodes combined between Naruto and Shippuuden will learn them. So the greatest part of this anime is that it is large, evolving, changing. But the world, can, be at times, almost TOO large. You can have one episode in the middle of Konoha (Village Hidden in the Leaves in the dub) and then suddenly jump to a location far far away, with little pretext. While that's fine and dandy, it's hard to jump from place to place and time to time. Some episodes also are happening at subsequent times with others: randomly making up numbers, but 42 and 43 could happen at the same time in the Naruto world -- just in different places. The world is great, but the method they use to show it can be jumpy and confusing at points to someone that isn't used to it. Art -- 6 The art in Naruto isn't bad. Well, yes it is. Wait, no it's not. Wait, yes it is. And that basically sums up the art in Naruto -- it will be pristine one moment, then trash the next. I remember at one point during one of the ever-so-long filler arcs, the art quality got so bad that you could just see straight lines for people's edges, rather than the often used inventions known as curved lines. But as soon as the story came back into the main story arc, the art suddenly jumped back. I think even the studio that works on Naruto gets tired of the filler, sometimes. Overall, it would be a 7 or 8 normally, but due to the laziness of the studio in some episodes, I'm bumping it down to a 6. Sound -- 8 The other great thing about popular shows is that they can always have an amazing soundtrack. This is true for both Naruto the original and Shippuuden. The opening, closings, and themes of Naruto are not overly complex, but recognizable and not harsh on the ears. Some memorable themes from both series would have to include ""Blue Bird,"" ""Sadness & Sorrow,"" and ""Sengunbanba."" Though they are spread out -- most of the openings and closings aren't bad, just not memorable -- there are the occasional few that you will remember and think ""that music paired up so well."" At one point, a very emotional instrumental piece -- Sadness & Sorrow -- was played during the funeral of one of the ninja leaders. The somber attitude, good artwork (for once! hooray!) and moody and powerful music allowed that particular episode to stay in people's minds. Character -- 7 Character, character, character. The characters of Naruto are always evolving, changing, etc., etc. But the problem is -- is that when you have such a large world, with a couple hundred characters, the majority of them will get put on the side. So you are introduced to Awesome Character Z, who you love for maybe 10 or 20 episodes. But then they're put to the side, and they just become filler every now and then -- it's hard to include everyone. The main characters' development is nice, to say a lot. If you compare the Naruto at the start of the original series to the Naruto now, a lot has changed. Even more so if you compare it to what has happened in the manga. It basically follows his life from the 12 year old child everyone hates (you know there is one of those kids you hate in your life, don't lie!) to a respectable and caring adult (ish?) person. Of course, he's still the same old perverted, bloody-nosed kid on the inside, but the change in attitude, thinking, and manners is noticeable to say the least. Other characters -- specifically Hinata -- are thrust into a main-supporting role, with small development -- she basically has a crush on him which cripples her, and then she has to confront that and either save herself or Naruto in order to be productive, and stays like this for well, the entire series. These sort of characters (see: Temari, Gaara, Hinata, Neji, etc.) are basically only used for the advancement of the main characters (see: Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Sai, etc.). Enjoyment -- 7 Okay. Filler. Filler. Filler. OMG Awesome episode-! No, wait, filler. The enjoyment of Naruto is spliced up -- the fillers are generally boring and only put out to keep the massive drones that support Naruto appeased -- but I have to admit, there are some pretty awesome fight sequences and battle scenes. If you are one of the people who likes to skip over / breeze through filler, then you will get a greater enjoyment out of Naruto Shippuuden as a whole. It seems as of late like they've been stretching each of the episodes out a little more than needed (as if to give the manga an already larger head start which it doesn't need), but I'm willing to chalk that up as a decision to explain what's happening fully. At the moment, a lot of complicated drama and plots are coming together and unfolding, so the pace doesn't need to be as fast as in the manga. Regardless, counting filler, enjoyment is about a 7. Without it, it would be an 8 or 8.5; just filler would be a 4.5ish. So as a whole, it's a 7. Overall - 7.5 TLDR: You can't really put ""halfs"" on these reviews, so I decided to be generous and give it that extra .5. Out of the ""kings"" of shonen mainstream anime, Naruto definitely is not the worst (see: One Piece, Bleach) but not as refined as the best (see:Fullmetal Alchemist). It has very strong story and sound elements, and can have both very crappy and very well made art. The character development for main characters is fantastic -- just not so much for the static and supporting characters. The enjoyment value is high when it's following the manga and not in filler -- it is dismal when it is in filler, though. Overall, it's a decent series. Maybe not watching 400 episodes worth if you want to catch up / are starting new, but not a bad series by any means.",7,Recommended,"Jan 6, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5f3a57627e,5
"I started watching Naruto the wrong way. The first thing I knew about Naruto was his battle with Pain. Then after that, I began watching Jiraiya's fight with Nagato. Sakura and Granny Chiyo's battle with Sasori. The Third Hokage's death. And so on... I missed a lot of episode, nevertheless, I knew I should begin with the first episode not in Shippuuden but in the original Naruto itself. But nooo. I was so stubborn so I began to read the manga first. Ever since I heard that Naruto has ended, I was itching to read its manga for good. And I did. A week later, I found myself crying and inspired. I regret not paying attention to such an amazing manga. STORY : Some would say I'm exaggerating, but for me, Naruto is what I can proudly say a ""masterpiece"". I love Naruto so much it pains my kokoro. Any month now, or maybe a year, Shippuuden will end like a flash. Fillers may make this masterpiece a junk but I assure you, some fillers are worth a shot. If you hate it, then don't watch it. The pacing will still be the same. Naruto will remain the same. I may not be a super Naruto fanatic, I can't call myself that yet. Naruto may not be my childhood favorite but it is my inspiration. The heck with Naruto-more-then-a-decade fans. I, too, has Naruto inside me. Ninjustu. Gengutsu. Taijutsu. Senjutsu. Fuinjutsu. There are so many justu to elaborate with but that makes this anime special. Over the past decade, I hear many jutsu throughout my community. I remember how I used to play games on my friends ps3. Naruto here, Naruto there. Even now, when I attend cosplay events, Naruto is still popular. I always ask myself why. Why is Naruto so popular? Is the anime even this good? Why is Sasuke such a news word in the society? Now I know why : it's because you can never change time. You can never change hearts. You can never change memories. Naruto has its own place in the anime industry. As well as any other anime out there. Even if A LOT are already tired of fillers and unending battles, this anime will never waver. Who could ever forget Naruto famous ""I'll become a Hokage"" quote? I'm sure that I won't. (10/10) CHARACTER : Ahhh. This is what I love the most in this anime. So let's start with Naruto Uzumaki. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki. The prophecy child. Who would not love Naruto, anyway? He may be a loser, a brat, a stupid shinobi, but who would have thought that he could can the whole shinobi world? Naruto's development started when people hated him more and more as he grows up. And later did he blossom when a person finally acknowledge him. He is not just the nine tails jinchuriki. He is Naruto Uzumaki. And he will become a hokage. A man full of words is better than a man who doesn't recognize his worth. And there's come Sasuke. Sasuke Uchiha, the avenger (coughs). Kidding! I honestly hated Sasuke at first. Unlike Naruto, he only wants vengeance. He locks his self in his own wicked world. He wanted to become strong to kill the person who attacked his village, his parents, his everything. I know it must have been painful to witness your beloved killed also by your beloved, but putting everything aside for vengeance? Alright, that's pretty much okay. No one could ever stop you anyway. And if it wasn't for Sasuke the avenger, things would not end up the way it is in the end. Everyone has a purpose in life. Despite of everything he did, I'd still want him back. He's home is Konohagakure after all. And as for Sakura. Oh, I love her development. From a weak and fragile girl to a strong and powerful woman indeed. I never hated her, really. She has her own issues and I respected that. She love Sasuke (who doesn't?) so much that she was willing to do everything for him. Love is a battle, and so she took her own path by becoming a shinobi that can stand by herself. She is a character that has an open development. Watch the anime and you'll see how she strive everything for her to be acknowledge the same way the rest of the Team 7 were. There are many more characters to praise. Everyone changed for the better. They had their own pain, happiness, beliefs. Thank you specially for Naruto's Will of Fire for leading the shinobi world. Everything was worth it. (10/10) ART AND SOUND : I am not really good when it comes to analyzing the art style but from what I saw, it was an okay for me. There are some fights that I was expecting a lot of animations but thank you for the sound and effects my feels stays the same. I love how the sound can be so perfect from time to time. There are many soundtracks too that I would love to listen over and over. The background music is always fitting with the atmosphere. It makes me cry, ya know!!! I just hope the animation will be amazing in the last part of the series. (MadaraxGuy / SasukexNaruto fight pls) ENJOYMENT : I cried. I laughed. I felt the pain and the hopes of many shinobi in this anime. And I wouldn't have asked for more. Thank you for the roller coaster ride, Naruto. Thank you for teaching me not to give up. Thank you for the comfort and love that I haven't realized all these years. And oh, thank you Kishimoto Sensei for creating Naruto. I love you so much, thank you thank you thank you!!! Words will never be enough for inspiring me to believe in myself. I will never give up. No matter how hard life may be, I'll always remember Naruto's will of never giving up.

""A masterpiece will never be considered as a flawless creation nor idea. Everything and everyone has its own flaws and mistakes.

"Tales of perseverance and redemption dominate Naruto: Shippuuden, but the delivery stumbles into the familiar trap of idealistic overkill. Conflicts that should challenge characters morally or strategically often dissolve into speeches about friendship, willpower, or destiny—rendering complex struggles toothless. Every major villain is eventually revealed to be misunderstood or tragic, stripped of their menace to fit a world where no one is truly evil, just hurt. While the intent might be noble, the execution feels disingenuous. All episodes were watched—not out of enjoyment, but out of habit. Completionism has its curses, and few shows test that like this one. The show leans heavily on emotional highs, recycling the same themes until they lose impact. Real nuance rarely survives its determination to turn every story into a morality tale.",4,Not Recommended,"Apr 15, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e04dfd3efd,5
"Watching this after it has ended and having the luxury to skip over the filler episodes leaves me with no choice but to put Naruto in the GOAT debate.

Story: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Music: 11/10 Everything: 10/10 Not many animes out there can stand the test of time but Naruto/Naruto Shippuden certainly is one that can and has already done so.

Without exaggeration, this anime is responsible for a generational shift in anime culture. As Naruto was probably many people's first anime, it has largely contributed in moving anime to the mainstream. Stories like Naruto has kept audiences captivated for over 15 years keeping those who started it when they young captivated until its end, and until its audience grew older. This anime does not get the credit or the respect it deserves when it is literally one that changed people's perception of anime. Also, anyone that tries to put Naruto down is an edgelord who tries to stand out from the rest and probably enjoys something lame like slice of life animes.",10,Recommended,"Aug 7, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_713bd586a9,5
"It's been nearly 4 years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly 8 since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... 3 months later and 400+ episodes finished and here I am. I'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if I was watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a 500+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong. There was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters. Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness. I'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself. What started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for 10+ yrs and almost 1K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6290be85fa,5
"""Naruto is Naruto"" and though Ive only seen the first 5-8 episodes I would still keep watching it. The only thing you should expect from naruto is a great fight scene and a great story. I didn't think it was that different from the older naruto. The characters do however act differently, such as naruto. Ive seen the new guy and all that. Instead of comparing this to the old naruto, you should be looking forward as things will change when he gets old and you should expect that from a series that continues as the characters get older. Things have definitely got more serious but the fighting is way better. I stopped watching old naruto at episode 120 because it became to childish for me(even though I really love the series). This is why I like shippuuden. Because they have taken a more serious approach with the series. So naruto fans Id high recommended this to you: )",8,Recommended,"Mar 10, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_46d398a6d6,5
"Naruto has given me many LIFE LESSONS that i honestly didn't recognize until i watched the show. Naruto has given me inspiration in everything that i do. I know this may sound absurd but Naruto somehow made me a BETTER PERSON! Stories of love, fear, bonds, hopes, and dreams, gave Naruto a deeper meaning than just brawl and comedy. It serves an inspiration to me in real life. Naruto brings revolution in people!! Its addiction!!Its faith!! It gives you the strength to believe in yourself!! Even if you’re broke, or faced a break up with your girlfriend, sad, shattered whatever...and even if you don't watch Naruto that day...but thinking about it... i don’t know why, but it will make you smile and give you strength!! Naruto is all about determining the way one should treat people after going through everything possible in the name of sorrow and grief in life!! In anime, Naruto Shippuden is god!!! TRUE FANS know the virtue of Naruto!! It’s a feeling, call it an experience which is found in the words used aren't just put to explain the moment and thoughts of the people in it... But it has a meaning in the future!! Every time you watch an episode of it again and again, the interpretation is different!!!

"Plot: Naruto Shippuuden is the continuation of the original animated TV series Naruto.The story revolves around an older and slightly more matured Uzumaki Naruto and his quest to save his friend Uchiha Sasuke from the grips of the snake-like Shinobi, Orochimaru. After 2 and a half years Naruto finally returns to his village of Konoha, and sets about putting his ambitions to work, though it will not be easy, as He has amassed a few (more dangerous) enemies, in the likes of the shinobi organization; Akatsuki. Naruto is an extremely popular Anime in Japan and even across the world.. The setting and the characters of this anime will make you want to live in this world..

"15 years. It's the reason I have for this to steal my heart despite its flaws. The story of a loser who changes the world. Positive symbolism is through everything, characters serving as general explanations for wrong human behaviours and the complexity of life are all stirred in a thick and massive stew of characters, affiliation, thoughts, perspectives, feelings...Naruto is a huge world with lots of stories and depth. And of course with so much time you can tell so much but this also means that the franchise targeted a few stages of teenage years to create something bigger than the story itself by adding the element of time to the viewing experience. Some people will call it undeserved hype, but they also probably masturbate to stuff like Aoi Bungaku, Steins:Gate or animes that did not get a second season but oh boy was it going somewhere. This anime is timeless, Naruto and Miyazaki are immortal and if we would be fair enough to only grant access at an hypothetical bar in upscale London to animes that were able to obtain such status, the bar would never be short on staff. Haku should of gotten more screen time, Jiraiya's death was needed but very dramatic, sasuke is ultimately kind of a douche, sakura should of been stronger and knowing that there is traffic on narutopedia is somewhat cool.",8,Recommended,"Nov 1, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3f65c33cc8,5
"Naruto series is the reason why i started watching anime and Shippuden is honestly one of the best anime i've ever watched,or simply,the best. i kinda have a perfect life, unlike naruto, but i can relate to him at some point. i'm touched by how naruto is determined to work hard so that the village would acknowledge him as someone who is worth to be watched. Despite his lonely and sad childhood, he didn't let those things to overcome him to become dark, but instead, he let those sad memories as a fuel to drive him to become a better person. i love everything about his character, his annoying yet funny stupidity, his unconditional love towards his friends and comrades, his endless hard work even when everything around him comes crashing down. most importantly, i love how he use his past to understand others instead of judging them. being as strong as he is but still is humble enough to lower himself for something he believes in is just pure inspiration. from being a loner to being around many loyal friends and comrades and have the trust of all shinobi in other hidden villages. he will make an amazing hokage. this anime might be fictional, but i value this anime so much it has more meaning and depth than that. im very sad that this anime is coming to an end, but this anime and the messages it contains will forever live. thank you Kishimoto for this amazing journey you've shared with me and the rest of naruto's fans.

"The show gave me much enjoyment for many years with the amazing fight scenes and great story. However the animation has gone down the toilet amazingly fast. There are very select fight scenes that occur every year or so that are well done, but the corners they've been cutting to keep animation budgets at a minimum is not well hidden. Half of the episodes are now filler that are completely intrusive and have no place in the show. The episodes are now long and drawn out with flash backs or long pauses. I absolutely love the manga and it tears me apart to see how they've animated it. The animations are now just borderline stillframes.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 24, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a71ae4b0be,5
"Naruto Shippuuden seriously started off very strong for me. After that preview episode with Naruto and Sasuke facing off again I got so much hype. I got so excited as I thought this was gonna be so awesome. Like the be all to end all clash of epicness. The first two arcs were pretty damn good I'll give that. There were some tearful moments when a few of you're favorite characters were seen dying. I thought that was a good way to really get you hooked. But by the end of it Naruto Shippuuden felt like such an after thought. Now for me the original anime got so many things right. The character development was big for some of the characters, The action was enjoyable and of course it really kept you excited for things. My only real complaints were that the filler lasted forever sometimes and it felt like it was taking too much inspiration from a lot of anime. As they were targeting the right audience for both kids and adults. It had just enough humor and serious action for all the fans. But let me get to why Shippuden basically fails on some degree. The first point is that Naruto himself seriously lacks character development. I mean sure he does learn a new jutsu here and there. But he lacks his own sense of humor compared to the original series. It's also very hard to feel for him most of the time. The only time I ever really felt any sympathy for Naruto was when someone special to him died. I'm not going to spoil any of the big moments as if you are curious you can check it out for yourself. The rest of the other character development is take it or leave it. You'll have to decide for yourself which characters you love the most. The storyline this time around is nothing to write home about. While I will give it something for trying to connect everything more. Also the fact that it tries to be very mature in some parts. Though its something I can't get into in general. The fights are also really awesome to some degree. It has a lot of amazing moments and it was really good. But I seriously began to lose interest after some filler arcs and when I was two or three arcs into Shippuuden. The artwork however is very good in general. I think the anime looks very sharp overall and the presentation is quite good to me. The music is great once again. With traditional Japanese music and some epic orchestra music thrown in. The presentation might be one of Shipuuden's strong points. Overall Naruto Shippuden is something that has dissapointed me. I did really enjoy the fights to some degree. The music and artwork is also quite good as well. But to a degree this has dissapointed me so much. The emotion also feels very lacking and you could really careless about the story. But I find it very difficult to really enjoy Naruto Shippuuden in general.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 14, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7e2bc30bb1,5
"Well I dropped this a while back, but I figure I leave a little something regarding it. Naruto was one of the first anime that I did pick up when I was actually getting serious about watching. I watched the original series, OVAs, and movies. It was ok overall, but I felt it could do something with that story. Then comes along Shippuuden, which I thought it would do expand the story and make naruto seriously epic. I was wrong. I don't even know how I managed to get to episode 255 including all those countless filler. I mean sure Bleach and One Piece have fillers, but Naruto takes it to a whole different level. I really can barely recall at least 5 episodes for Naruto that were seriously epic. So on that note, no more naruto for me.

"Alright, Naruto Shippuuden itself is badass. You just can't help but to love certain characters, the action is great and the emotion is there but most of the times you either won't care or you won't even notice. The music in the anime is fantastic and really gives that ninja/shinobi feel, especially due to iconic Japanese instruments such as the shamisen. Some tracks may be overused a bit, but it's not bothering in general. It just makes certain moments predictable. Although I love the story, I can't stand the fillers and flashbacks. They use flashbacks and fillers on the most inappropriate moments. Let me give you an example: In the middle of the final battle they will throw 12 fillers in your face. After that they continue with the final battle for one episode, and while a character's performing a major act for the story.. he decides to have a flashback, continued with another flashback episode. Seriously, it's ridiculous. It totally ruins the atmosphere, excitement and enjoyment. They also repeat a lot of scenes from flashbacks, heck I wouldn't be surprised if some episodes are the exact same, but with the scenes in another order. This is why I rate Naruto Shippuuden a 6 overall. I find myself saying ""AH NO"" way too often on the first frame of the ""Next time on Naruto Shippuuden!"" at the end of every episode, which isn't a good sign.

"Naruto didn’t just entertain me—it shaped me. As a kid, it wasn’t just a story about ninjas; it was a story about being different, about standing tall when everyone told you to sit down. Naruto’s journey from the outcast nobody believed in to someone who inspired the world felt like my own. Every time he yelled, fought, cried, smiled and showed how he still continued his journey, I believed in myself just a little more. Plus great fights, great complex and connected stories. Sure, it’s not perfect—what is? But for me, it’s more than an anime. It’s the late nights trying to pull off a Rasengan, the hours spent working hard in myself, the weeks when I wanted to give up on many things just to remember Naruto's way, and even the tattoo I got as a permanent reminder of what Naruto taught me: that hard work, heart, and stubbornness can beat the odds.

"Naruto Shippuden. This show is both loved and demised. I personally like the series, it's good and nice to watch, nothing overly amazing and not that much overly crap shoot stuff I hate. (OH WAIT) Story: 7 The story in Shippuden is nice, all wrapped up with a bow. At times it is serious and somewhat thrilling to watch, and other times you're blowing bubbles in your chocolate milk as people talk about stuff for over a minute. The overall plot in the story stays the same almost the entire way through, Naruto wants to ""save"" Sasuke, somehow stop Akatsuki, and be recognized by the village. The last one happens after Pain is defeated, and none of the other ones have happened so far so, more sludging through. (WEEEE) Art: 6 The animation changes so much throughout this series, in such varying degrees and yes, I know that the studio has a budget, but when you use the same flashback over five times, barely even ****ing shade anything, keep characters frozen still while they're talking, and try to pass off people staring at each other for a FULL MINUTE as part of the show, you start to wonder how Studio Pierrot is even doing. But the show does have nice, fantastic animation. It's just not as frequent. Also, some of the best animation and shading I've seen in this show have been during fights and the OPs and EDs, and some other places throughout. Sound: 7 This is a another reason why people hate Shippuden. I'm not talking about the voice actors, they're great, I'm talking about the music. Sure, there are nice tracks throughout the series, some are beautiful, others I could somewhat jam to. But when I think that you've played that same stupid ""OMG SUSPENSE SH*T IS HAPPENING"" track for the hundredth time, I feel like face-desking. So many tracks are overly repeated to the point where you feel like you could play them if someone gave you the instrument they were playing the music with somewhat mediocrity. I'm also including OPs and EDs. A lot of the openings and endings sound great, like ""Cascade"" and ""FLAME"" Others sound, well, annoying, overly produced, and bleh. BLEH. Like the sh*tfest which is ""Totsugeki Rock"". Just, ewwww. Characters: 7 The characters in this show are nice. Sure, some of them are kinda tropey, but most them have something unique. Naruto seems to go through lots of pressure, CAUSE GUESS WHAT? OP PEOPLE WANNA MURDER YA! So he gets to experience and grow through that. Sakura is still romanticizing with hopes of being with Sasuke, and I can be harsh here, but I can't. I'm a hopeless romantic too. *sigh* She is tough though, and doesn't take no sh*t. Sai is shown to have had a bond with a person who was like a brother to him, and they then had to fight to the death, (**** you Danzou) and it had feels. Sasuke is a stupid hormone controlled idiot who wants to destroy the thing his brother protected, and ""build a new nation"". Can I call him stupid again?The other characters are fine, but a lot of them you couldn't really feel for since you didn't know that much about them. Enjoyment: 5 FILLER. FILLER. FFFFFIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I""M HERE WANTING TO SEE A NEW EPISODE OF CANON, I SAY, CANON SHIPPUDEN, AND PIERROT THROWS A ****ING FILLER EPISODE OUT. AND IT""S AT SUCH UNNECESSARY MOMENTS TOO, LIKE A BATTLE JUST ENDED, EMOTIONAL SH*T HAPPENED, AND YOU THEN GET FILLER, YOU THEN FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TWO TO THREE WEEKS AGO, AND YOU DON'T GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT THE **** HAPPENED, OR YOU JUST FORGET ENTIRELY IF THE FILLER RUNS FOR EIGHTY YEARS. AND SOMETIMES THE FILLER SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO THE MAIN STORY AND IT'S BULLSH*T. THE PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST BINGE THIS SHOW AND SKIP FILLERS I WISH I COULD PUNCH. *heavy breathing* The fights are nice as well, like GAI V MADARA. IT WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT, BUT IT WAS STILL AWESOME. Overall: 7 Shippuden is an average anime. It's ruined by filler that isn't even interesting or good in the first place, constant reused flashbacks that taint the whole entire series, and the animation at times can be atrocious. (See Pain V Naruto, or ALL THE STILL SHOTS EVER SEEN) The fights can be fun, emotional, or awesome. The main story is nice, but falters at times. The sound can be the most annoying thing of the show at times, but can also be charming or pleasant. This show has over 400 episodes. If you are a person who likes 13 episode anime, then this series is going to be tough on you. If you don't like shonen, then stay away. If you're expecting romance, there ain't a lot of it, I gotta tell ya. There's only around four major moments out of over 400 episodes. If you want awesome action stuff, then this show may fit to your tastes.",7,Recommended,"Aug 29, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a62b97338c,6
"The number one knucklehead ninja is...still here! His training seemed to get him no where maturity wise or skill wise. He has used the same jutsu, the same yelling tactics to throw his enemy off(?) And the same &quot;I'm hokage&quot;, &quot;I'll save you!&quot;, or &quot;My childhood sucked!&quot; Lines. He hasn't grown or learned a thing. I would think he would stop endangering his team, being disrespectful to his senior officers, and trying to solo things rather than listening to the plans. When they were younger it was acceptable, it was even funny at times, but not now. Any scene with naruto I skip immediately. It is either screaming, crying, or &quot;kage bunshin no jutsu&quot;. Sakura and others are shown to have grown and learned many things through their training. Sakura has become way cooler than she ever was in Naruto, as well as tenten and others using newer styles of fighting from Naruto. I guess we will never see a change in the main character. I really did enjoy Naruto, but maybe I expected too much from Shippuden, or to much of a change maybe? Either way, I feel like now that they are older and with the main character still acting like this, makes the whole shinobi thing, along with all of the danger and life-threatening fighting look like a complete joke to the theme. As well as they are afraid of killing people off in my opinion, having them win against people who are said to be the greatest in the world. Making the characters older really did nothing, it is meant for the same audience that watched Naruto, and who didn't want any change or development. The story is pretty good though, I enjoy learning about the plot development as it goes by and want to see more about Akatsuki's plans. The story with sasuke and orochimaru is good also, as I feel it will all be tied together at some point in the anime and we should see some good fight scenes (I hope).

"ROAD BLOCKS IN PLOT WRITING AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM: SPECIAL ABRIDGED KISHIMOTO EDITION 1) I created a unique main character with a great ambition, how do I make this character instantly likable? Kishi says: I’ll let you in on a trade secret: “Tragic motherfuckin’ back-story.” You want your character’s childhood to be filled with angst, bullying, depression, thoughts of suicide, and maybe molestation (save this one for an easy shock reveal later on!). Remember, your character in present-day needs to be NOTHING like his childhood self for he will have overcome that shitty past with the almighty “STRONG RESOLUTION”. It’s all about the compare and contrast. “Good people deserve good futures”, readers love this. 2) Every protagonist needs an antagonist. What should a good antagonist be like? Kishi says: Polar opposite. A perfect antithesis of the main character. Have him bent onto a totally evil goal, like say... oh I donno... revenge? Also, make him sexy and make him mysterious. Chicks love that shit. And don’t you fucking forget about that tragic back-story! 3) Should my female characters be important and useful? Kishi says: No. --- Many pages of wisdom later --- 56) I have followed your sage advice. My protagonist has forgotten his original ambition and is now stricken with intense homolust for the antagonist. As per your suggestions, I have also went through many INTENSE training arcs: a new ability training arc, a training arc to prepare for a training arc, another new ability training arc, a timeskip training arc, a training arc after a training arc to control the new power gained from a previous training arc, and finally, super saiyan training on Namek. Kishi says: *wipes tear* This is beautiful. I couldn’t have done better myself. ---A few pages of growing regret later--- 72) Since that timeskip you recommended, I feel my protagonist has become severely overpowered, rendering everyone, but his lover, primitive in comparison. It seems that he has already long surpassed his original goal and achieving it now won’t amount to any sort of satisfaction. What hurts the most however, is seeing my fans clinging onto the hope that the plot would carry on, only to be repeatedly swindled with more pointless drivel. Should I bring my manga to a quick close with an epic fight against a greater evil? Kishi mutters: Don’t be asinine. Now is the perfect time for another flashback.

"I just want to start this review by saying that I love this series and I have my reasons, and while I will try to be as objective as possible, I am a fan (this should be known). Story: One of the benefits of such a long story like Naruto is that it truly feels epic. When you finish the series, you feel like you have been through it all with these characters. The story is character-driven as you see our main protagonist, Naruto, and the difficult journey that he experiences throughout his life. This series is quite a bit darker than the original and very mature. This works in this series benefit as its a seriousness that is needed for many of the key moments in the show. It spans through various story arcs that will always have there fair share of intense and ""edge of your seat"" moments. I want to note that there are many times where you will find yourself freaking out due to a particular storyline or amazing moment. Art: This is my lowest grade as the animation can be all over the place. However when it really counts, this series knocks it out of the park with its animation. Some important episodes in the story will literally look like series of high-quality desktop wallpapers flashing in front of your face (no joke, it looks that good sometimes). The fight scenes in this show are probably among the very best anime has to offer. They are visual spectacles and fights with key villains are a whole other level of amazing. It can look slightly weird at times but nothing that will stop you from watching the show or lessen your enjoyment of what you are watching. Sound: The openings and endings are all incredible in their own right, with a wide span of music genres (rock songs to love songs). Some soundtracks like Konoha Peace and Experienced Many Battles will literally invigorate you with so much emotion (its crazy). I will say that not all the tracks are perfect but they do their job. Character: I can't even describe how good the characters are in Naruto because you just have to see for yourself. I think you can attribute this to how good the Chunin Exam arch was in the original Naruto, but in this series they are just more fleshed out and deepened. You will literally see characters that you may hate at first but end up loving a couple episodes later. The main character, Naruto, is extremely well done and you can't help but like him. The other main character, Sasuke, is equally well-written. The rivalry between the two characters is really something that this series nailed. Enjoyment: This review really can't do this show justice or express my love for the series as a whole. There is a reason Naruto is as popular as it is, and its because it has touched so many people around the world. While there were some bumps along the way, it was worth it.

"I've been watching Naruto for a very long time. I've read the entire Manga and completed Naruto (Part 1) I've also seen a few of the movies and all the ova's and specials. The story is utter garbage. It's dragged out and supplemented with horribly written filler arcs. The pacing is painfully slow and unnecessary. The battles are relatively interesting but there is too much needless talk and deliberation. The art/animation is inconsistent and changes from episode to episode. It's usually very poorly done and while this might be good for saving money and time. Naruto is one of the most heavily marketed Anime in the world, it should have enough funds to pay for decent Animation. The characters are the best thing about this series. My personal favourites being Madara, Sasuke, Itachi, Orochimaru, Naruto, Kakashi, Hinata and Jiraiya. These characters are pretty deep and deal with their own struggles. The sound is pretty good. Good OP and ED's. It's enjoyable to watch but people need to stop rating it so highly. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect and it's pretty damn overrated but it does provide me with lots of entertainment and I'm still watching after 399 episodes...

"Naruto Shippuuden is like Star Wars the Disney Sequels - a whole lot of retconning, fan service and bull crap. It's one of those anime continuations or endings that were better off not happening at all. The problem is the story, not the anime, the animation quality or manga, the story is the main culprit. As it continues off from how Naruto ended, the story starts off full of hope, energy, a lot of new adventures, but just like One Piece Post Time Skip, it just should have not existed at all. Just to see the story ending and the price being the whole story turn into garbage is a price way too high for anyone to pay. The way the story goes in Shippuuden and how it is explained the origin of Ninjutsu is also too far-fetched and not a satisfying conclusion. There is a lot of going back and forth in the series, a lot of nothing happening for hundreds of episodes, meaning literally years passing with nothing of significance happening. Then there are a lot of useless side-characters from other ninja villages being introduced, each one gets their own flashback to explain their motivation, again wasting at least 30-40 episodes for absolutely no reason. A lot of the time is Naruto acting all strong and mature and Sasuke playing emo once again with some new followers buying his crap. At the end there is a great culmination, combined with dead characters being brought to life and useless characters being killed off like Portgas D. Ace in One Piece just to create a fake feeling of how dark and serious stuff are (which isn't the case), then comes the ending filled with even more retconning and fan service and the series ends. I was glad when it ended, not because I was happy with how it ended, but with the fact that it's over, so I don't have to put up with this trash ever again. The original Naruto series is far superior and it should have never been continued into Shippuuden if it was going to be the garbage it was. This is further emphasized in the series Boruto, which is literally 70% fan service and 30% riding on the old story's fame hoping to keep this garbage afloat.

Bleach -One piece-Fairy tail( this is kinda a new one comparison to the others) and i must sayNaruto is by far the best on all its aspects. People hating this anime where they havent even watched it is wierd Story 10-----This is one of the deepest animes i have seen. There are about 50-60 characters in this anime that all have their own stories which drag-on and they have their on impact in the flow of the anime.Putting together a solid story with all these characters and the actual story of the anime is something beyond difficult. The clans, the villages, the bijuus, the skills, all the chakra explanation and the battle system.Naruto-Naruto Shippuuden its a world of its own running in a perfect flow. Who would epect Obito would be alive after the accident, a story that took palce like 500 episodes ago-Naruto shippuuden does that, its not like the other animes that every episode erases its past and starts a new story , its a well-built story with almost non-glitches Sound 10-- 10 is too litle for the most succesfull anime in terms of soundtracks and music. Yashuharu Takanashi has done it again(and Toshio Masuda of course) all the tracks are masterpieces, no wonder why some of the tracks are of world fame and used for other rasons aswell Art 9-- Very much improved from its prodeccor Naruto-not eprfect though Character 10---Who didint like that clumpsy loud voice kid at the first part of this anime...Naruto and the others have grown in Shippuuden but in a great way. Naruto has grown as much as he should be and changed as much as he should be.He is not a complitely different person neither the others, but they all have added new aspects i their characters matching the years difference from Naruto. Overall 10- Seriously Naruto Shippuuden is indeed a famous (maybe?)mainstream anime?. So what?? That doesnt make it bad.Its a high quality anime , one of the best that ever have been aired with very deep story, best music ever made, quite good art and amazing characters.

"My Thoughts on the Ending of Naruto First thing first. I will miss Naruto like no other. I first came into contact with Naruto way back in the 7th grade of middle school when it used to air in English on Toonami. It was love at first sight. The date was September 10th, 2005. I eagerly awaited each week for new episodes, and Naruto never disappointed, even on its worst episode. Fast forward 9 years later, and I'm still eagerly awaiting each new episode every week, even though I have already finished the events of the manga. Critics of Naruto say that the anime/ manga has gone on for way too long and that it should have ended earlier; it's no longer good. I can't deny that Naruto has a ton of plot holes, but even so, the author has given me something to consistently look forward to for 9 years. How many anime series can you say have done something like that for you? Moreover, my interest in Naruto is not solely tied to the plot. To this day, I've bought 12 Naruto games and counting. I love the Naruto universe. I love the characters. I love the powers. I love the action. I love the voice actors. All of the Naruto games I own do an amazing job at recreating the characters from the series and letting you feel as though you are the character. When I choose Sasuke in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, I feel like I become Sasuke. All of his powers from the show, I can command at the tips of my fingers. I'm the one using the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu, and I'm the one unleashing Susanoo. As a result, the joy I get from being my favorite characters in these games heightens the amount of pleasure I take away from the series itself. It's been a couple weeks since Naruto ended, and it's still hard to believe it's over. When I read the final chapter, I honestly didn't want to turn the pages. Seeing all of the characters that started off at 12 years old become adults, get married, and have kids, really got believing that it is in fact over--the end of a generation. I was 12 years old myself when I began watching Naruto, now I'm 21. In a way, I feel as though I've grown up with these characters and that my youth is also approaching it's end soon. In the coming years, I'm not sure if I will ever experience an anime that has done what Naruto has done for me ever again. I'm really sad that my journey with Naruto is rapidly approaching it's end, but I'm also thankful for these past 9 years.

"So now that the manga has ended its serialization and the anime still continues to spew endless filler for no reason other than to milk as much money as possible, I am writing a review to explain to you why Naruto: Shippuden was a promising anime that went downhill since the first episode. The story of Naruto is an interesting and unique one. Its something that hasn't been told too often and it has a great setting. But the anime does a very poor job of executing it. There are a few canon episodes, then a plethora of fillers appear out of nowhere, so that when the canon story continues from where it left off, I have somewhat lost my hype on what was happening before the filler. This is even more prominent towards the end of the series, which is where there's supposed to be excitement above all else. The fillers themselves are so bad they ruin the characters' personalities to some extent.The canon episodes are dragged on by the same flashbacks so many times you'll start feeling sleepy. The characters' backstories, especially Naruto's, are shown so many times, you won't even feel sentimental anymore. There were some great story arcs like the Pain arc, but the rest all drag on and on. Speaking of characters, Naruto has some of the best characters in anime, hands down. Protagonists like Naruto, Shikamaru, Kiba etc and antagonists like Itachi, Nagato, Madara are some of the best ever in anime history. But I feel that as the series progresses, the series starts focusing too much on Naruto and Sasuke and leaves out interesting supporting characters. Even the notoriously bad guys are somehow turned into good guys through some bullshit backstory so that they MUST turn good before they die, even evil-F*CKING-Madara. so the series kinda ruins the characters it brought up, though I wouldn't say they are bad. The animation too goes downhill since the beginning, and this is one of the worst aspects of the show. Too many still images, too many flashbacks, too long recaps are all there to increase the runtimes and save up some budget. There were some arcs that were decently animated, but others are sloppy and still to the point I sometimes thought my computer froze. The soundtrack has a great Ninja-esque felling to it, and it unique and in most instances, pretty catchy. Most of the opening songs are great while the endings are average (I guess). The voice acting is done greatly, as one would expect of anime (lol). The dub, of course, is terrible.WATCH THE CAPTIONS!!!!! Overall, Naruto is good if you ignore the plethora of fillers, the sloppy animation and the terrible dragging on of its episodes, but that just can't be ignore can they?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 18, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6364963855,6
"Naruto returns completely different, yet unchanged; yaoi fangirls, filler, and cliche friendship speeches still ruin it for the most part. Shippuuden and the original naruto are by far the most overrated anime since Gundam Wing. I read the manga up to where it is now, and I can see how it got there, but how the anime maintains fans still amazes me. The fans are classified as ""Narutards"" to the public, due to its overwhelming popularity. They provide 20 or 40 episodes of filler after 20 slow plot episodes, and it's just not funny at this point. I already stopped watching it an entirely moved back to the manga. The manga still manages to keep me interested, but the anime is dead to me. I loved shippuuden until the filler started getting ridiculous. I don't know what those guys in the anime industry are doing, but it's screwed up how they love to send their ratings plummeting into the ground so often. Originally, Shippuuden was an anime that had everything; tons of suspense, meaningful death scenes, and touching moments, but now it's just another anime about some grown man that acts like a kid chasing after a homicidal maniac that used to be a ""Friend"" of his.

"A good anime, like any piece of art, isn't judged only by it's art style, characters and story. It also heavily relies on the production, fan base and various other factors. While this anime started out well enough it had completely degraded itself with almost 45% of the episodes being fillers. As a fan I get totally engrossed in the plot and when the production decides to milk the fans for more views this becomes a stab in the back of dedicated viewers. For 10 years I've watched this anime and at long last after all said and done all I can say about Naruto (and derivatives) is that it is garbage. Never waste your life on this show.

"Review for both Shippuden and the Original Naruto. Naruto is... a journey. I remember back in my earlier years of school watching the show late at night was kind of ritualistic for me (together with Shaman King). Now, me being a year away from graduating high school and the show airing for 14 years coming to a close earlier this year, I decided to watch the last 100 or so episodes after taking a long break from anime to put and end to a part of my childhood. Man, did I miss out. The anime itself, through time, grew and changed, just like everyone that watched it since the beginning. It started off as a silly-headed shounen about ninjas and super powers and ended with the main characters aiming to save the world from devastation. Story-wise, Naruto goes through hardships, endures pain, learns from his mistakes and tests his strength against many foes, but ultimately the final showdown is between him and his first rival, which proves that the show didn't lose focus throughout the years and finished on the note that Kishimoto wanted to (brilliant on his part). While the artstyle is unique and easily-recognizable even for non-anime viewers, quality really drops at time, most evident in the filler episodes, which I'll talk about later on. Music is really well put all-around, it makes you pumped when there's an action scene coming up, makes you emotional when something sad happens and makes you literally laugh out loud when needed. Something that strikes me as surprising is how well-developed is the supporting staff. Most of them are filled with personality and distinguishable, likable design. For every arc focused on Naruto, there are a couple focused on his friends that help him through his path, which leads me to my next point. Naruto's motto, ninja way or nindō or whatever you want to call it, is that of never running away or going back on his word, which really speaks about the show itself and the lesson it wants to teach. As the already mentioned hardships suggest, Naruto never altered his vision or casted aside someone else's feeling or dreams, showing that there is always a reason to try your hardest and be righteous. Not everything is without its mistakes, though. The only gut-wrenching flaw about the series is how. many. god. damn. filler. episodes. there. are. They make up about half of the episodes, while most of the provide little to no content. To cut some slack off, some of the arcs are pretty amusing by themselves and deserve a watch. Overall, the anime is great, it certainly has a special place in my heart, even if I won't revisit it sheerly because of volume. As undoubtedly one of the most memorable long-running anime out there, it surely is a thing to relish if not for the entertainment it brings, but for the millions of people that it inspired, just like dragon ball did to the previous generation. Now the baton is passed to his son, Boruto, and only time will tell if he'll make his dad proud.",9,Recommended,"Aug 29, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_dde0008a59,6
"Naruto is more than just a long-running shonen anime. It’s a cultural milestone. At its heart lies the story of a lonely boy who dreams of being acknowledged, fighting against prejudice, loss, and rejection. Through Naruto Uzumaki’s journey from outcast to hero, the series explores powerful themes of perseverance, identity, the importance of bonds, and the pain of growing up in a broken world. One of Naruto’s greatest strengths is its emotional storytelling. It doesn’t shy away from heavy topics like trauma, war, and sacrifice. Even minor characters are given meaningful backstories that deepen the narrative and evoke empathy. The arcs vary greatly in tone and scope. From light-hearted village missions to large-scale wars. While the pacing can be inconsistent, the emotional payoff often makes the buildup worth it. The animation, especially in Shippuden, fluctuates across episodes due to the sheer number of them, but it shines in key battles like Naruto vs. Pain, Kakashi vs. Obito, and the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Visually, the series matures over time, with Shippuden showcasing sharper art direction and more dynamic choreography. The soundtrack is equally iconic, enhancing both somber and uplifting moments with tracks that linger long after an episode ends. Beyond its action, Naruto offers introspection and hope. It reminds us that people can change, that pain can heal, and that connections with others can redefine our fate. The worldbuilding is another major strength. Rich with lore, diverse clans, complex ideologies, and a power system (chakra, jutsu, kekkei genkai) that offers both spectacle and strategy. The voice acting, both in sub and dub, deserves praise. From Naruto’s raw, emotional outbursts to Itachi’s chilling calm, the performances breathe life into the characters and their struggles. While the high filler count and a few overly drawn-out arcs, particularly near the end of Shippuden are valid criticisms, many fans agree that the emotional weight of the journey outweighs its structural flaws. Despite its length, many arcs retain rewatch value due to their iconic confrontations and heartfelt moments. Even if you know what’s coming, Naruto still hits, sometimes even harder the second time. Naruto is a grand journey that leaves a mark, not just because of where it ends, but because of everything it fights through along the way.",10,Recommended,"Jul 19, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9c54564f07,6

As viewers we are able to see Naruto's growth as a character from an immature brat to someone who can truly understand the pains of mankind.

"I'm sorry.. it's just so bad in my opinion of course. The art is dumbed down from the original series, the sound is... pretty much the same stuff. The character development for the new characters is pretty good... Enjoyment.. is bad because.. well... FILLERS... EVERYWHERE... it tries making you bored out of your mind or on the edge of your seat so even the most pointless event seem exciting. It's dragged out so long. I believe it should only be around 50-100 episodes. I quit watching the original Naruto at like 80 then started watching Shippuuden because my friend really likes it, but we literally skimmed through the first 40 episodes within about 2 hours, and I did not miss any details at all. I discussed the main bad points about Naruto with my friend and he agreed with all of them which include the ones that I have talked about before. They're overcomplicating it in my opinion, and should stay focused on the main problem, create ""sub""-problems that lead up to ending the main conflict, which seem to be the problem with a lot of mainstream shounen anime. They try making a series as long as possible to make the most money out of it rather then creating a good story, with good art, and characters that a person will thoroughly enjoy. Overall, Naruto Shippuuden gets a 5/10, There are a lot of shorter anime series that gets to the point of the anime which are much more exciting, because they cram all their interesting ideas into a short time span rather than having a single event drag out over a term of 3-10 episodes.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 21, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9ec65bd00b,6

"Regarded as one of the world’s most popular and long-standing animations, Naruto has undoubtedly crafted a shinobi universe that is intriguing for anime viewers. The styles of different clans, the movement of each jutsu, the history of each nations, all of them are well-choreographed and deserve a big applause. The foreshadowing is brilliant and what amazes me is that they always succeed in keeping the mystery going until the “real” truth is unveiled, such as the Itachi/Sasuke arc and Madara/Tobi arc. Why Naruto as a character Ruins it for me: The downside is, while there is an amazing array of characters on the show (i.e. Rock Lee, Gaara, Shino, Iruka), the show solely puts its spotlight on Naruto - which is a shame. The author made no effort to give other characters a chance to shine and that leaves the show rather dull and one-dimensional. Characters like Tenten, Ino and Kurenai are merely females to waste away in the background. My least favourite part is Naruto Uzumaki, who has continued to be one of the most unconvincing and quite frankly, an annoying and obnoxious character. His positivity gradually becomes a massive turn-off in the show. When it progresses to a point where everyone just blindly praises whatever comes out of Naruto’s mouth, you just can’t help but roll your eyes. It’s so far-fetched that it’s just absolutely bonkers! There is a fine line between a motivational speaker that is full of utter gibberish and a good inspiring character that doesn’t overcompensate, and here is where Naruto fails to do for me. Everytime he speaks, I would just happily mute the thing. :) One of the wasted potentials in the show is characters like Rock Lee, who works his way up against all odds and no ninjutsu talent. With his humble (and much more likable) attitude, I can see how this underdog could potentially turn the table at the end. Still, the show never shows mercy to any character other than Naruto. Most of the time, everyone is just there fighting until they are saved and rescued by the all-mighty Naruto and his “genuinity”. For once, I would just like to see other capable characters to shine in their own ninja way, instead of making the Naruto way the only way. Last but not least, the amount of filler and recap is frustrating. You spend 20 minutes watching a full episode and only ¼ of it is new. What a drag. As someone who started out as a huge fan watching, and having a completely different opinion towards the end, I am to say the least disappointed. On the other hand, I would recommend its two spin-offs, Uchiha Sasuke no Sharingan Den (manga) and Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals (anime and manga), which are very well-written and hit all the right notes if you’re down for some lovely wholesome humour.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 22, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_af69bc0e19,14

I loved it as a child, it was my favorite anime with Dragon Ball. But for a criticism, I have to be a critic, with countless fillers and holes in the story, Kishimoto didn't know how to manage such a large work. His last arc as an ending took so long, that I broke my fingers from skipping the filler episode so much. In the middle of a war, putting filler is nothing, with Naruto doing shit I don't like in the anime. Whoever watches the complete anime after being old, realizes how badly managed the work was. An anime that I consider and a lot, but the only way to find this anime perfect, is either not understanding anything, or is to love blindly. For consideration, I leave a note of 5.

Story- it begins with 3 main story's and they are all carried out through the series. The show makes sure to explain everything so your not lost. Everything seems to be connected to each story, so it's not like the story's is nonsense and irreverent. Everything links up so good. Sound- Naruto shippuden has an awesome OST soundtrack. Songs match up with the characters and situations emotions. Intro songs are so good that I download some to my phone. They always switch up the music so you get to listen and find new songs. Charterers- each character has a story, and these story's are fill with such meaning. Each character will teach you a meaning or even a lesson. Charterers are all different with their own personality's. These characters have special bonds with each other and you can actually grasp onto those bonds and relationships.

I found it just pointless If Sauske wanted to come back to the hidden leaf, he can do it on his own. Art & Sound: Honestly I loved the voices of every character and the art style was pretty good too. I have no complaints here Characters: Alright so we got Loveable yet annoying Naruto Believe it then we got useless and lets face it desperate sakura, we got ""Cool guy"" and sometimes a jerk Sauske.

"Naruto is a long drawn out tale full of adventure and an enormous set of characters. The show has its goods and its bads, unfortunately the bads outweigh the good.. greatly, but even then it does serve its purpose in the anime world. Naruto at its core is a pretty bland show. It came about to bank on the power trip stories that came out of Dragon Ball Z. Bleach, One piece are all reminiscent of what Dragon Ball Z was. A guy overcoming unrealistic challenges to attain his goal, they are always invincible, any damage is always fixable, in any encounter you KNOW they will come out on top because that is how the show runs. It is a predictable heap of shit. Banking on the DBZ sentiment is not bad though, look at Avatar, it is not an anime but it is inspired by anime. Avatar does something all those shonen fail at, Avatar knows what it is and it does not choke on itself. Naruto and majority of other shonen try really hard to be mature and deep. The problem with this is that what they deem to be deep and mature are really not it. Avatar knows it is for kids, it isn't a try hard show biting more than it can chew. You want gritty and deep and mature go somewhere else. You want a show pretending to be mature and act tough like a 16 year old teen then this is it. I mentioned the show has its place. That is correct, it has a place among the younger audience and it is expected that as you grow older you get tired of this shit and grow the fuck up. Don't be one of those 20-30 year old youtubers commenting every week on the new episode release of naruto, it is really sad. So in the end I'll say this: Watch Naruto, watch it alot, have your fill. Use it to refine your taste and branch off from there to anime that is less shit. story: 3 pretty shit story, this story has been done a number of times, watch something else. It is repetitive and gives a rosy false view to kids. FRIENDSHIP WON""T PAY YOUR BILLS OR GET YOU INTO SCHOOL, IT WON'T BRING YOU BACK FROM THE DEAD.

"This series is a spectacle in the shounen genre. Let us not mince words!! This show succeeds in utilizing its cast of secondary characters due to a long episode count and filler episode budget that the animation studio has. Battle sequences are epic where new abilities need to be learned for our main character to keep up with the looming threats wanting to destroy the shinobi world. The villains in Naruto are very fleshed out. Naruto Shippuuden gets you invested in the main characters and rooting for them quickly into the first Akatsuki onslaught. The filler episodes fall into the ""hit-or-miss"" category, so if you are watching for the story or over-the-top shounen fights, you might wanna have a list of filler episodes ready so that you can accelerate thru the long episode count.

Once you get past the infinite amount of filler, or decide to skip them, it is clear that although Sasuke's retrieval makes up most of the adventures, there is just SO MUCH MORE to follow along with. Naruto Shippuden can have you crying, laughing, stressed and angry all in the course of one episode. Characters: My oh my how they have changed. All of the characters have grown so much and even Kiba is likable haha. Here are two examples: Naruto came back a whole new person. Literally. His outfit is upgraded, his maturity has somewhat increased, and so has his height ;) Sakura: one of my favorite characters is clearly no longer ""useless"". I love her but I have to admit, she did not have much to contribute to Part 1 but now... If you haven't caught up to at least episode 400, your in for a treat! Overall Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, the movies, the manga, everything is 100% enjoyable and if you decide to stick with it to the end, you'll be in for a treat",10,Recommended,"Jun 5, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6bc6d49839,14
"An anime I was very fond of, which I could label myself a true FAN (which is rare to me) but that I unfortunately felt forced to drop. The reason: Way too many many many fillers, plus the way that Sasuke guys suck lemons with his arrogant attitude and demeanor, and how Naruto won't just give up the prick. This turned this anime I really liked into something unwatchable in only 95 episodes. I lost my patience when they came up with that Doton/Crystal element arc. I mean, fillers are fillers, but Shipuuden's are hard to get through, they're too bad to watch from start to finish. Plus, even if it didn't have fillers, the story drags itself, the pace is soooooo slow, makes me think Kishimoto doesn't respect the fans. This is at most a mediocre show.",3,Not Recommended,"Nov 4, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_bcf093c6e6,14

"It's a boring show and I couldn't even stand watching it anymore. I don't read the manga, so I won't be comparing it to the manga. Up until the Pain arc ended the show was great (I would of gave a 8 overall) except for boring filler episodes, but once the Konoha past filler ended it went straight down hill. It started becoming some bad emotional drama. Every second a flashback would occur showing some scene involving Naruto and Sasuke playing the SAME song every time. I mean 2 non-filler episodes were literally 18 minutes of flashbacks showing the same flashbacks they played the last 10 episodes. I can't stand the silly plot anymore and if flashbacks are not happening it's the same thing reoccurring. All the Hokages 'WAR' let's go tell the feudal lords 'WAR' let's let all the people know 'WAR' that took 20 episodes LONG. There was no plot development what-so-ever.

"I personally feel that this anime is one of the best I've watched, due to the darker atmosphere it gives compared to the original Naruto and the addictive nature of the plot.

"this will be short and sweet. I don't write reviews but naruto having so many 10's really gets to me. The overlaying story is very well done(for the most part). the art, i like(unlike some younger people used to way different quality). Sound is on point. Unique and impactful. That being said, everything else about the show is mediocre at best. The characters advance, but done actually DEVELOP, with the exception of naruto and sasuke(i'll give you shikimaru as well i suppose). Sakura learns to fight, and then barely does. everyone else has basically a static personality that may change a little bit, but then goes back to as it was. This show, along with bleach, are what i call failed potential. Great premises, could go so far, but seems to fall short due to filler and mediocre character development. I will say the show is enjoyable, but come prepared with a filler guide and if your anything like me, u can watch naruto and around 100 episodes of shippuden before you feel it's worth watching. as for me it was the first death involving an akatsuki attack(if you've watched, you know who) that finally made the show seem to have some form of realism and depth and frankly it shouldnt have taken that long. If a 12 episode anime with a crappy story can make me cry, why did it 300+ for shippuden to illicit a similar response? If you read this, thank you and i encourage you to watch the show, as it lasted for a reason, even if i feel it fell short of its mark.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 20, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d0a1cc4b0f,14
"Just over one year after starting the original Naruto series, I have gotten through all 770 episodes. Although I did not get to experience it in the way many others did by growing up with it through the many years of its airing, in a way I lucked out because I did not have to spend months watching weekly fillers. I personally believe reviews/ratings by people who watch a show later after it has aired are a lot more reliable than ones that are given immediately after a show finishes airing. Peoples expectations and bias towards a show often cloud the reliability of a seasonal show's rating, especially when its a preliminary rating (no idea why people rate shows before completing them). But thats beside the point. Naruto is arguable one of the most entertaining series not just in anime, but in entertainment ever. Its ability to captivate an audience and blow them away was put on display numerous times. Whether it was the opening arc of the Land of Waves, the Chunin Exam, or Pains Arc, it told its story in such an interesting and fun way. Even though Naruto isnt exactly known for its complex plot or characters, theres really no anime that comes close to it in excitement. Fillers suck, yea we get it, try to go a day without complaining about the Naruto fillers challenge (most of you would fail). Naruto Shippuden has some quality filler arcs compared to the original series, particularly towards the last half of the show. Great filler arcs that come to mind are the Kakashi, Itachi, and Kaguya background ones. If people would look at filler as extra content instead of waste of time, then they would be able to enjoy it a lot more. Its like DLC!!! Damn... the characters in Naruto Shippuden... are something else. Pretty much every main Uchiha character is awesome, along with Team 7, the Kage, and some of the Konan kids. Naruto's character is the highlight of well, the Naruto series. His character isnt exactly complex. He doesnt go through much character ""development"" per say. But watching his story, and his dream, play out its hard to put into words the feelings you get from that. Hes such a bright, uplifting character and it makes viewers so happy to see everyone around him not only acknowledge him, but follow behind him as their leader. Focusing on the bright side of an anime series is what people in this community should always do. You can critique Naruto for its many filler arcs, or for not putting lots of effort into animation. But the show is still the most popular and impactful anime of all time for a reason. It has that IT factor that makes people of all ages want to watch it. No other show will ever be able to do what the Naruto franchise has done, and hopefully nobody tries. The thrill and hype moments Naruto brings are forever cementing in Anime history.",9,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_71ade1bf4e,14
"Naruto shippuden or called filleruto, was great at the start, then fillers ruined it like crazzy!!! the arc now has been going on since 2013, and the latest 20 episodes have all been fillers, i dont understand whats going on? oh well, shippuden takes place 3 years after the first naruto anime, everyone you saw in the original anime has grown up, the characters in the start are really not that great, exept the main enemy group, later characters become better but are still one dimentional, like the animation, shippuden it feels like have gone threw so many diffrent animations, sometimes it looks good, sometimes awfull, right now its fair, one fight scene with naruto and a main enemy has the aboslute worst animation i have ever seen in an anime, i mean wtf. Sound is really good tho and it has great intros and outros, naruto tho is the most typical shounen there is so dont expect, one punch man animation or , death note storytelling! The characters that are good are really good! like itachi uchia, sasuke uchia, naruto altho he can be annyoing sometimes, and the enemys in the hole show are some of the best ive seen in an shounene anime, overall 9/10 without fillers, but now its filleruto so 7/10",7,Recommended,"Dec 18, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_455775fb9b,14
"I said I was gonna go to bed but I lied.....I'm not gonna write much as I know some people have a serious problem with naruto and I can totally understand why. Instead of grading Naruto Im gonna just do The good, The bad, and The Ugly. ""Your doing something different? Thats so stupid and wiierd. Why would you do that?"" It's simpler, faster, easier, and because f**k you, thats why. THE GOOD: Story has a very fun and interesting premise with tons of action, superpowers, ninjas, respect, badass fight and much more. The story is so long and complex it really has some great plot twists that are a pleasure to watch even if you know it's going to happen 50 episodes before it happens (because most of us read the manga). The characters are awesome and you become attached to them the more you watch. They all have flaws, they all have personality, and they all have history. It all ties together quite nicely over the years since this anime began. THE BAD: This is strictly my opinion so feel free to completely disregard this section and go onto the next because I know for a fact that alot of people will not agree with what Im about to say. It didnt have enough romance, there I said it. I think there could have been a few places where romance could have boosted this anime up to around an 8.4ish score. Once again I dont expect people to agree with this so please disregard this section if you disagree. I would actually appreciate a personal message telling me what you think about this whether its good or bad. Im very interested on what you guys have to say about this topic and upcoming movie. Anyway, moving on. THE UGLY: Im pretty sure you all know what I'm goin to say...and yes you are right....FILLERS. Now dont get me wrong. I grew up with Naruto starting in 5th grade and this show holds a special place in my heart. But I gotta say, there is nothing worst then a very important climax or battle arc getting interrupted by a stupid filler. It can be a complete turn off. Are some of them fun to go back and watch? yes! of course! but the timing of them is horribly off in my opinion and they can get lengthy and as you watch more of them you start getting angry and frustrated. ""this is pointless"" probably describes the feeling best to some of you. THE OVERALL: 9 in my personal enjoyment, 8 in terms of quality overall (as a critic) I have been watching for so many years now so it is really hard for me to critique this fairly. I hope for the most part you guys understand where Im coming from. Overall this anime is a great watch. Probably will be a classic when its all over, but that will be along time from now. Im extremely jealous of anyone just starting the series now because you get to skip all those fillers. But yeah, please watch it, it only gets better as you watch and the more you watch the more you wont be able to stop. Most deadly jutsu? Flashback no Justu hands-down. This jutsu can easily can rip anyones mind to shreds, destroy someones sanity, or worse.....make them turn off the computer/TV in a matter of seconds :0 .....deadly",8,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a1236f010b,14
"Ok to start with naruto this is one of the first anime that i had ever watched when i was a kid. Naruto is the type of anime that has good character storiesx due to its long run and has a decent story in which usually doesnt stale in my eyes atleast. I really enjoy naruto definetly one of favorites but it does have alot of flaws. First of all the art style tends to change just recently in the story the art style changed from what it was before its not a big change but its still there. Second HUGE flaw about this series is the constant filler in this anime we will get around 3 episodes of cannon and then get thrown into flashbacks and even sometimes it will takes months off of the story to show us a full filler arc and the amount that it happens makes watching very boring but they do make up for it when the story usually resumes. Another thing that can sometimes be wierd is the animation it can be good and it can also be at a stand still and just freeze at times. In my opinion Naruto is a good show to watch its a 10/10 in my book just because of my connection but for the average person a good 8/10 sounds about right give it a watch if you like long running shows.

"I'll be honest: I didn't like Naruto that much. Now before you think I've gone nuts, hear me out. I liked the premise of the story and I enjoyed the beginning of the series quite a lot as well. The sound track is pretty nice, albeit a little dramatic at times and I liked the animation. I liked most of the characters, even. But there were a few things that really killed the series for me. One issue was that there were way too many fillers. Even die-hard Naruto fans will agree with me on this. There were so many just useless episodes about random missions or life at Konoha or whatever, that I started to get sick of watching. Some of them were nice, I'll admit, but most of them added basically nothing to the story line and got on my nerves. Out of the 500 episodes of Naruto, at least 100 are fillers and for me, that is just waaay too many. There was also an issue of a few plot holes and good ideas that were not revisited at all, which got me mildly to thoroughly irritated from time to time based on how interested I was in the idea. But in the long run, I don't think that problem alone would have made me dislike the series as much as I do. This next one is kind of personal preference. Although Naruto doesn't have a bunch of blatant fan service or girls in bikinis and whatnot. I eventually got sick of the fact that almost every new female character was introduced with an obligatory butt shot or boob shot. For some of them it was more odd and out-of-place than the others, but overall I'd say that the idea just kind of got old. Fan service in general isn't really my thing, but I don't mind it that much if it doesn't become a central part of the story. Once again, however, this is just personal preference, so if you like fan service or don't find butt/boob shots boring, this won't bother you at all. But the biggest issue I had was the Sharingan (an eye that grants the user access to special techniques). In the beginning, I really liked the idea of an eye that can copy other jutsu (ninja techniques that are somewhat like magic, but marginally explained) instantaneously. It was an interesting idea and I looked forward to its uses and how it would be developed. I expected there to be some kind of upgrade to it. So when Itachi (one of the characters) showed up with a Mangekyo Sharingan that was very useful to for genjustu (marginally explained mind control), I accepted it. I didn't really get how someone could get from a copying eye to any eye that can hypnotize people, but I just kind of shrugged and went with it. But when Sasuke (one of the main characters) and Itachi started to yank literal skeleton monsters out of their eyeballs, I got super irritated. Explain to me how in the world we got from a copying eye to an eye that has enough room to fit a skeleton. At this point the writer was blatantly just adding complete bs to the Sharingan in order to make Sasuke look more ""badass"". Sure, it made him look marginally more competent, but to me, it was just irritating. It made no sense in any way, shape, or form and was just a major plot hole and turnoff. The final nail in the coffin was when a villain with the Sharingan showed up with a dimension in his eyeball. How? Just how? You're really telling me that there is now a special dimension accessible to Sharingan users that no one had any prior knowledge/ idea about? What does the main ability of the Sharingan, the copy cat eye, have to do with pulling dimensions out of thin air? It was like the writer was trying to see how far he could go with just random, unexplained power ups to the Sharingan. It was infuriating, stupid, and I lost what little respect and awe I had for the Sharingan I had with this ""new ability"". The entire constant evolution issue with the Sharingan was even further offset and outlined by the Byakagan (another eye that gives the person access to special justu). The Byakagan was established as very strong and blatantly more powerful than the Sharingan at the beginning of the series. So when I noticed that the Sharingan was turning into some kind of a monster, God-like eye, I expected some sort of special Byakagan to form. But the Byakagan stayed completely the same from episode 1 to episode 500. If you're going to power up one eye so much, at least stay consist and do something to the other one! Overall, some parts of the story were done really well. Some aspects of the plot and some of the messages wrapped up in this story are good. But some things in the story just completely killed it for me and even though I watched the entire series, I kind of wish I had just dropped it once the problems became too much for me to handle. Even so, a lot of people like Naruto and there is nothing wrong with that. I just listed what issues made Naruto a no-go for me. So if you have read the plot summary and don't have any issues with the problems I outlined above, go for it! Hopefully you will enjoy Naruto more that I did.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 18, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_522275399b,14
"Anime with the best ninja story concept ever. I watched Naruto anime since I was in junior high school. This anime is very popular in Indonesia. All anime lovers in Indonesia, must know about Naruto. An anime about epic ninja fights, and entertaining ninja adventures, as well as a harsh ninja world. An anime that tells about Uzumaki Natuto, who wants to become Hokage, and become a great ninja, who is relied on by many people. This anime is good, but there are things I don't like.

This is a bit annoying because it did drag out some of the scenes, which I found a bit unnecessary. I think filler episodes break up the flow of the anime and makes me confused about what's happening when they finally end and go back to the main story. However, the anime was really fun to watch. The anime had the right amount of comedy and angst when needed.

"Brief overview: A Shonen series that is set in a ninja world with a massive amount of flashbacks. This review will be based on the whole Naruto series from the beginning to the last movie. Boruto will be excluded. Introduction Set's straight after the last Arc of Naruto where Orochimaru takes Sasuke hostage. Meanwhile, Naruto is on a mission to save his close friend Sasuke and get stronger to become a Hokage at the same time. Story 7/10 For most Shonen series the genre always primarily focuses on the identity of what the anime is known for from the beginning. Bleach and Naruto is an action and adventure series where Demon Slayer and Hero Academia are similar but have added romance within it. Naruto sets its identity well at the start especially the romance chart however, as the series progresses it leans more towards telling a deeper story and the romance chart becomes more or less a mess within the characters. The main story is great, but they implemented so many flashbacks towards the original Naruto as fillers throughout the series. It is unnecessary to add so many flashbacks from the original Naruto as we already have witnessed it from the beginning to the end. A good flashback would be outside of the original Naruto such as Hashirama's time period as it tells how the hidden leaf is built or a small flashback that talks about how Hinata fell in love with Naruto. What ruins this series is the romance. The story is trying to incorporate the romance genre into the series which it limits the world content we get to see as the story already has tons of flashbacks and the romance genre doesn't fit into Naruto. This is because it makes the series look like another typical school romance drama which it does not fit into the action, emotional, and rich story world of Naruto. Generally, it's a great story but with so many flashbacks and character narrative, it limits the world we get to see in Naruto such as the Samurai's, Hidden Mist Village, and Iwagakure. Even if they show other villages and places it is not much and it feels/looks more or less the same as all other places that Naruto has visited. The most strangest thing is that they incorporated so much unnecessary modern technology into the world of Naruto such as that fucken ninja using a world war 2 radioman to operate during combat when they already have one of the mind-jutsu that lets one of them communicate through all other Ninjas mindset. I won't be surprised that they would use fucking Gun's in Naruto maybe AK47-jutsu next. Characters 7/10 The characters is definitely well-written but the problem with the characters is that each character's relationship doesn't fit well with the other characters. I give you an example throughout the series they keep trying to say that Sasuke is basically like a brother to Naruto and Naruto is trying to get him back to the good side. Now everything is well written but truthfully Sasuke and Naruto don't work well compared to Naruto and Gaara. If you take a step back and look at it. Both of them understand the same pain and suffering from their childhood when they first met no one understands what Gaara is talking about however Naruto is the only one there that totally understands him because he knows that type of pain and loneliness while Sasuke does not fit in because he already had a family from the start while both of them don't. Another problem is Sasuke and Sakura. Throughout the series, they keep implying that despite all the evilness that Sasuke has done Sakura, still loves him even towards the very end. However, most of the time the relationship between Sakura and Naruto is deeper than Sasuke and Sakura if you look at it. Naruto was there when the Hidden Leaf was about to get destroyed and he was also there during the great ninja war. Both Naruto and Sakura share a very powerful bond with each other as both of them witness catastrophic destruction multiple times. Yes, Hinata was there at the same time but it's only for a brief moment compared to Sakura and Naruto. This is why romance does not fit into this series when the author is trying to make everyone fell in love instead most of the intended characters have barely any relationship development at all. Another problem is the Hierarchy system of Naruto. In the series within a village, the Hokage is usually the strongest one however, during Tsunade's reign most of the time there is so many other candidates that is stronger or at least have more knowledge than Tsunade. A couple of examples would Kakashi, Guy and most importantly Danzo. Aside from all that Naruto is portrayed very well within the Series because if you look at it Naruto was never the strongest or the smartest character within the series. He makes mistakes and those mistakes are learning experiences to make him into a great person which those mistakes gain him trust and allies who share the pain with him within the series. Animation 5/10 The animation suffers the same thing as One Piece it is a coin-flipping type of animation. However, I have never seen anything that is so well-animated yet bad at the same time. One perfect example is the fight with Pain. They drew the fps well but fuck if you look at the face it looks abysmally bad towards the point that is funny. Otherwise, the animation is not bad for the most part but there is time to time when some parts is poorly animated and times when the animation that looks goot yet bad at the same time. TLDR It's not a bad story if you can ignore the massive amount of flashbacks and the ridiculous modern technology that is used in the ninja world. The characters are good but matched towards the wrong characters when they should've been matched towards the character that understands them the most and the animation is a coin-flipping quality where sometimes the animation can look good yet bad at the same time.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 13, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5309c48d56,15

The sound, the animation, the story, everything is awesome. But there is one thing that bothers me. The ending. It could've been 1000 times better... In my opinion, it should have stopped when Sasuke and Naruto are lying on the ground after the final fight. After that, everything feels like non canon episode. All the hype was gone, and Naruto didn't even become the hokage. Also, the art and animation was batched.

"Naruto is a tricky one for me. I absolutely adore the manga, I'm still reading it and I was really excited when I heard that the Naruto Shippuden was coming! The first 30-40 episodes were alright...not great, but they weren't terrible. After that, there were just too many fillers, strayed quite a bit from the manga and I just dropped it.

"Naruto Shipppuuden has a spectacular story with well built characters. I am not only talking about the main characters, but also secondary characters and especially the villains. Not to mention that it has the best fighting animations ever seen. Not only the animation at technical level but the own choreography and strategies of the fight according to each individual and its power. The story has many ramifications and variants, which despite one and another plot hole (which is understandable because of the extended time of its development) every each character evolve and go through a growth and development of character. Naruto is that character that we can understand and we want to be like him. We see his growth, it is not a character of 2 dimensions, but of 3 or 4. The same happens with many others, and the most fascinating are the villains. Especially those from Akatsuki. For me, Pain is one of the best-built villains I've seen so far in anime and even in movies. I quoted this anime on my master's thesis countless times, exactly because of its story and character construction, and also because of its animations and fight choreography. Anyone who loves a good fight (choreographically and visually) will feel immense satisfaction in this anime. Just like anyone who likes a good story with good heroes and good villains, both quite human. They do not make the characters just the flawless hero or the inhuman villain. No. The characters have a reason that moves them, because of their life experiences. I strongly advise.

"After the original Naruto series the quality of the story diminishes greatly. Mostly because Naruto's popularity made the corporate control over the series much more involved, thus skewing the story to fit polling, and also the narrative got really convoluted just in terms of enemies and power ups and this and that. I'd still recommend watching this just because some parts of the story are worth knowing! If you've seen the og Naruto, seeing Naruto pursue Sasuke, and Sasuke's bid for power and search for the truth are something you want to see unravel. Lot's of really cool fights in this series. Can get really monotonous though, especially if you watch fillers.

"Naruto is my favourite Anime of all time it is because of Naruto that i like anime as ,much a si do now so with that said this review is going to nbe very biased but its my review so i can do what i want ;) This show has far surpassed my expectations of the first series.The storyline is so informative and powerful there's nothing you won't understand if you watch every episode accordingly.I love that all the characters have grown and the action is even more defined and EPIC!This has made DBZ look terrible in comparison.The story can make you laugh,cry,get angry at the bad guys and more.The one thing I do dislike is that they re-show the same parts over and over again in flashbacks but since they do add other sides to the story we already know it makes up for it. If you're a anime junky that is only satisfied by great action and a strong storyline look no further here it is! before watching Shippuden it is a MUST to watch part 1 but honestly if you havne't watched Naruto yet and are feeling put off by the filler sand what you have heard online then all i can say is give it a watch and let me know how you feel once you finish it.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0a142e863a,15
"NB: Recommended to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Because this is a continuation if did not know :) Naruto has been out for years for as long as I know but I never intended to watch it. Everywhere I go and talk with people about anime they will know about Naruto, both those who watches anime and those who dont. My thoughts were quite ignorant and I judged it for being overrated and being popular because its a long watching series, thats all. Until last summer where I binge-watched this B*cth within 2-3weeks. And I can swear to you, it was a beautiful journey where I felt so sad that it ended. I regret somehow, and even wish I tried it earlier. No sugarcoating! Dont let the earlier episodes animation lure you to drop out because the quality is a little low, if you compare it to those high quality anime series NOW. Ok enough rambling about how good it makes me feel :) The good: Story 10: The more you watch it the better and better it will be. No point in this series where the excitment, storyline, and pace drops down. Even at the begnning was already very good. I cant believe the author made this story where all the stuff connected to each other and gave meaning without being forced. I myself believe there is no plotholes, only amazing writing and how the characters interwines with the story so much. Character 9: Sooo many amazing character with deep and amazing background. You will get the feels and sadness for them, even though you have not seen much of them. Cool, cute, amazing made characters in this series, where you will enjoy the good and bad characters. The reason for why I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is because when most of them are that amazing, those with a little less character or personality, with background will fall down the list very low. You might even dislike som of them cause they feel so useless compare to the others character you know or like. Sound 10: The voice acting here is top notch, all of them are suitable for their character. And I love the way whenever they call out for their jutsu. The music in here is legendary for me. From epic, emotional, sadness and sorrow to happiness or the feeling of nostaliga. Beautiful made and brings out the act of the very scene very well. You are gonna be a fan of the music even when you have not watch naruto yet. Art 9: When I give the art 9/10 I am being a little bias here, cause sometimes you can notice the quality is not always top notch or even that good. Sometimes its amazing animation and quality. Other times you can notice the difference of this epiosde and that ep, thats the problem, when Im nitpicking. And the earlier episodes have not that great art if you compare it to the later episodes. Of couse it should be understandable since its older, so its a good thing that there is improvement. The bad: Nothing is perfect and I tell even my most favorite anime is not. Naruto has it flaws and that is the the bad thing. Lets call out for those jutsus 1. Filler jutsu, as fans calls it. Naruto its quite well known for being the king of it. And the amount of it is massive, thats a whopping 44% filler, if I have not recalled it wrong. Some of it was nice to have, but sometimes its downright cruel when you are in the middle of something big and they take you on for a 30 eps journey of filler. Good thiing its finished so you can just skip over those, I recommend to watch some of it though, if you are a hardcore fan. 2. Flashback jutsu. The use of flashback in here sometimes brings out tears of sadness and feels that hits you right in the face. But on other occasions when they show you the flashback of something so many times, it will lose it purpose. I think that was the shame of it on smaller occasions. Other times when flashback is used because the producers are perhaps scared that the viewers have forgotten scenes that they have watched for some episodes back or the ones you JUST WATCHED. And they show you the characters remembering the memories, the bad thing in this is that it has happened before where the character uses A WHOLE EP for that purpose. Thats enough complaining. Overall 10: I mean overall this was a wonderful anime, and I want to share this happiness and joy to as many as I could. I recommend this to be watched in your lfetime, and its strongly recommended by a very picky person. Pardon me if there are some grammar mistakes :) Do take me serious though :D",10,Recommended,"Apr 23, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_486365bc7f,15
"I'll try to keep this short: If you skip most of the fillers (not all), the anime is pretty good. It's one of those animes that grow on you over time, and it's all worth it when you watch the final episodes as if you went on the journey with Naruto, watched him grow from a nobody to one of the strongest people to exist in the universe. The music is really good and well used. It never changes from the original and it's used perfectly. Naruto has the best Anime plot I've ever watched. There are many characters and you will definitely find one to relate too. Most of the female characters are hard to like and some don't get enough screentime.

"Apart from the war arc and ending this is a great anime. Unfortunately the series ended up being milked at the end for money. Masashi Kishimoto's brother Seishi's o-parts hunter also had a war arc but it was done a lot better than what's in naruto. Yes the war arc has some exciting moments but it lacked a distinct purpose (and there are other parts that have you scratching your head wondering ""does that make sense""). It's pretty disappointing that kishi dropped the ball on the end because i think naruto could have continued developing characters. The fights going from more hand to hand to dragon ball level attacks didn't feel natural",9,Recommended,"Oct 25, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_838af4dbfb,15
"This anime is very emotional and can get both women & men to shed tears routinely. It has some of the best music of any anime. The fighting is masterful involving different types including physical - taijutsu, mental - genjutsu and supernatural - ninjutsu all beautifully choreographed. It has some of the best fights ever in anime like the mystery coffin man vs the Shinobi Alliance. But the best part is this anime has some of the best plot twists in anime history. At times you will feel like this anime lied to you for the longest time but you will eventually love it when the truth is revealed.

"Both series of Naruto were in my opinion unenjoyable, at its worst the anime is inconsistent with animation, plethora of poorly written characters and poor pacing with things like 6 mins of recap footage, cutaways to backstories and flashbacks not necessary to whats going on, and actual interesting characters in the original series that I liked ended up becoming background characters being replaced for even worse written characters. With the 700 episodes of Naruto you could better spend ur time watching 30 smaller 12 episode anime. At its best Naruto is full of unique design, amazing fight scenes and creative fighting styles and techniques, and interesting character dynamics developing one of the most iconic rivalries in anime history. Although I did not take the time to watch all 700 episodes I would not recommend anyone this anime",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 15, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7ac9bc69c1,15
"Naruto 1% action, 99% flashbacks I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails. Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far. Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over… It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc. You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks. My favorite characters are Mito Guy and Rock Lee, these are I think the only two who actually use martial arts whereas everybody else is using ninjutsu and genjutsu (“magic” techniques)",7,Recommended,"Jun 1, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5a01795e1c,15
"I feel like the ONLY reason this show received so many lower ratings was cause of it's fillers. I don't really blame that entirely on the show with all the studio management, catching up with manga etc. etc. I'm gonna rate this show at the core of it's story. And the Core story, is pretty much second to none. If you are willing to watch all the episodes of this series, which I know is alot, then it is damn worth it. The Story is So Grand, So Emotional, attacks the viewers in a deep and moral level, and so hype/exciting that I just can't get enough of this story and I'll be sad the day this show ends for sure.

"Naruto Shippuuden is a very average anime considering it's vast popularity and will make you wonder why it is so popular. Most people who are watching this or is planning to watch this has seen the previous series. I will warn you now with the exception of Naruto chasing after Sasuke and the female characters still being completely useless please forget everything you think you know about Naruto because it is buried one way or another. Story 7: It manages to keep you in suspense, but sometimes becomes too dark for fans of the lighter Naruto. Art 6: The art is still average. Nothing special. Sound 5: Beware voice actors and tunes that don't fit with a scene. Character 7: Some characters changed drastically, most stayed the same. Some characters are cliche. Enjoyment 7: I'm still watching it so I like it overall. The series pick up from Naruto two years later and we see how much our heroes grown changing the mood to a darker more mature tone. Part of the reason people stay tuned to Naruto was because of the light and refreshing tone so for it to be almost completely gone puzzles me. It makes me miss the plot line of the old Naruto. As for fillers, whether you like it or not fillers need to be use in long anime series so the mangaka can have time to write more. Still I guess the complaining of fans worked because there has been less filler use in the series. The problem is because there has been less filler use the pacing of the show has suffered. Some fights scenes are ridiculously long and constant repeat of the same flashback is the new norm.Even the camera shots are repetitive and unnecessary. For example in one episode with a reunion like air every five seconds you see the face of a character. It gets infuriating at times. Naruto has always been average with their art and this time is no exception. Expect the same overall look with the occasional darker backgrounds to draw more suspense. Also the characters look mostly the same with just a change of their outfit. Since this series is darker than the original Naruto so is the music. Even when it is supposed to be a funny moment sometimes the same dark melody will still play. The openings and endings are mostly mediocre, but if you want to check them out then do so! To me the dark tone of music sets the mood, but is overplayed to the point it does not stand out. Background music blends, but also makes the emotion of the scene stand out and Naruto Shippuuden falls to do that. Also it took me a while to get used to the voice actors. I know the characters have changed, but it's only been two years! Naruto's voice in the sub version sounds like a 30 year old man! When I watched Naruto I watched it in dub and I liked how their voices(even if it was annoying) matched the age of the character and was unique. Many characters in this series voice has the monotone base that never changes making the character boring. Now the moment most people have been waiting for in this review, the characters. ""Do Hinta and Naruto get together?"" ""Who becomes the 6th hokage?"" Well I'm sorry I won't be answering those questions, watch it for yourself. Naruto probably changed more than any other character in Naruto Shippuden. No longer is Naruto the repulsive ninja who acts before he thinks, no longer is he immature. The failure of getting Sasuke back and the training with Jiraya molded the Naruto we knew into a man. He is not even naive anymore. Sure chasing after a friend who doesn't want to be saved is naive in a way, but to me is shows his loyalty more. Sakura may have become a medical ninjia and strong like tsunade, but she is still useless like almost every girl in this series. As for Sasuke, if you still liked him after watching Naruto, well you won't now. Sasuke gets so annoying in this Naruto Shippuden it makes no sense. Sometimes you would wish anyone would kill him. Besides old time favorites you get a new set of characters plus a more detailed background of some minor ones like Kakashi. Still the characters are a little cliched. Overall I still enjoyed Naruto. It's funny considering at first I was totally against watching the new series, but life changes you sometimes. I would definitely recommend this to fans of the ninja genre!

"The beginning of this show starts off great, ill give it a 8 or 9 for the first few hundred episodes. However the show should of ended over a year ago. They had 3-6 episodes left to air as the manga was over and done with. Almost as if they are expecting the show to continue they have been adding fillers, For the most part its 1 drawn out episode then 4-10 filler episodes. The story is great, but the fillers are not, it has became a joke of several of the communities. I do recommend that you watch it, but follow the suggestions of the communities on what episodes to skip.

"I'm not using that sectioned up rating system because that's bullshit. I'm also not gonna follow all those rules on the right either so there will probably be spoilers in here. I'll write my review my way thanks guys. This is going in my blogs as well. Something's gotta go there! But oh god, where to begin? I guess with a bit of background. I started watching Shippuden back in the early years of high school when my then friends introduced me to it. The original Naruto was my first ever anime and I watched it in english dub. Naturally I wanted to keep it consistent when I moved onto Shippuden. As the years went on and I carried on keeping up with it, the dub suddenly stopped, but the story hadn't finished. I realised I had to wait. But I didn't want to watch it as it was airing, there were huge gaps between episode releases and even without them I'd struggle to keep track of the entire story for that long. So I gave up. And now, years after the fact, I finished high school, I've just finished college and I notice by chance that Naruto Shippuden's english dub is also finished. So I buckled down and decided to watch in full the thing that has haunted me for 5 years. And hoo boy, that was a journey. Overall, upon reflection the show feels like 480 episodes of meh with some great bits sprinkled in, followed by a final 20 episodes that might as well be a completely different show, they're so good. My biggest problem with the show is, you guessed it, filler. I must've skipped over 100 episodes worth of stuff, from whole episodes I didn't care about, like all those undead dudes we've never seen before but we get a full episode long flashback about them, or the never ending reuse of old scenes to fill space in an episode. When an episode didn't feature a single flashback, it was a mercy. There is one exception though. Paradise Life on a Boat. The arc is entirely filler, but it's also the best arc in the whole show, besides the epilogues. It finally lets up the dull seriousness for a while and let's us have some fun. Naruto's shadow clones staging a revolt, mushrooms of death, these are some of the best episodes of the entire show, and they have nothing to do with the story whatsoever. I don't really have a good segway into this next bit, but let's talk about the characters. I... don't hate Sakura... or Sasuke or Naruto or anyone really. Kaguya's a bit one-note, but gods usually are. I feel sorry for Sakura in particular. She's a great character but she's never allowed to do anything. She keeps saying to herself that she's gonna stand toe to toe with Naruto and Sasuke, but she never does. In the final boss, she does brief support for Obito and then gets one punch in right at the end. Poor girl. And Sasuke oooo, he pissed me off for a good while but, after seeing his final battle with Naruto, I kind of get it. He's been so wrapped up in hate and revenge his whole life he can't comprehend forgiveness even when it's right in front of him, and it takes Naruto literally beating some sense into him that he's finally able to admit to himself that he doesn't want to sever his ties. That's some damn good character writing and I praise Kishimoto for creating an arc this complex for a character he didn't even want to make originally. I was never fully sold on the relationships though. Most of the time I felt that Sakura could do so much better than Sasuke, and I didn't really believe the love between Naruto and Hinata, because they hardly ever interacted in the show. They needed to add in another movie right after the ending but before the epilogues to add some much needed depth to their relationship before dropping the wedding on us. Same problem with Ino and Sai too, but those two were more in the background so I don't really mind that they only interacted once in the entire show (that I watched) before that point. Besides, Ino is like the personification of sex appeal to me (remember, I first watched this show when I was going though puberty) so I'm automatically on board with anything she does (or anyone). Feel bad for Tenten though. I really like her and she even admits in the epilogues that she's spent so much time training and never takes time for herself. I wonder who'd be a good match for her. Maybe Omoi? He was fun. Also, the Akatsuki. In particular, Pain and Konan, because I love Pain's character design so much, and Konan because she's an underappreciated badass. Also Deidara because of his fun personality, and the fact that's he's voiced by Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm glad I waited for the dub. I tend to get really anal when I have to switch between dub and sub, especially when it's a show I care about, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Maile Flanagan will always be Naruto to me, as will everyone else. Dave Wittenberg is inseparable from Kakashi in my head and Neil Kaplan was a brilliantly threatening Madara/Tobi, just to name a few. In the end, Shippuden kinda feels like a series of peaks and valleys. The highs are super high, the lows are scarily low and there's basically nothing in between. I hate parts of it and I love other parts, especially the well animated parts. Naruto vs Sasuke is one of the most brilliant and emotional fight scenes I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, and I'm glad I waited till I was 19 so I can fully appreciate it. There were only four moments in this show that made me cry. One was, what you just read, Naruto vs Sasuke when Sasuke is finally able to admit to himself that he wants friends. The other was near the beginning where Gaara is brought back to life and he's surrounded by the comrades he thought hated him, and the third and fourth were Naruto saying goodbye to his parents. Those were some of my favourite moments of the story, and I will never forget them. Aaaaannnnd, I think that's about it. I've gotten my thoughts out, something that's been 5 years in the making. I love this show, and I hate it at the same time. I'm probably not gonna watch Boruto until the dub finishes, so get back to me in 2029. Maybe I'll have gotten over my joint crush on Ino and Tenten by then. Going through it, I figured I'd end up disappointed, like, 5 years of waiting for a 4/10, but thank god they saved it. If you want to watch Shippuden, watch it with a guide. This show is notorious for taking way too long to say not very much, so chop it down wherever you can. I skipped as much as possible but it still took me two months to finish. Or, if you watch nothing else of Shippuden, watch the epilogues, they're like Shippuden god mode and are better than all 480 episodes before them put together. The only question left is, after all that, what the fuck am I gonna do now? It's all over, I can move on with my life. fuck",7,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2f838e6567,15
"Well, if I say Naruto, every one knows what thats mean, fillers, good characters, a story of a lifespan, ninjas etc. So let me rate them one by one. First, the fillers. There are a lot of fillers in Sjippuuden, and some of them are too long to tear apart the exciting actions at the main story line. But, and thats a very big ""but"" I enjoyed all of them, it widened the univers, deepened the characters, get you more excited for the main parts or they were simply funny. And one of them actually hits, someone's face reveal (a photographer camuflaged man), I waited 8 years to see that face! Ninjas. They use chacra to empower their special jutsus. Chacra: It is a recycling type energy that flows in everything, if you use it, you have to ""heal"" it back with resting/meditating. Chacra is also working as the internet, it connects everithing with everything, can transport information, even matter. And in the end you will actually realise that Naruto is sci-fi. There are a lot of characters you will know in Naruto, and all of them develops through the entire series. So if you want a fantasy/adventure like sci-fi anime with some hundred episodes full of emotion and characteristics you will get it from Naruto Shippuuden!

"Who would have thought that probably the biggest anime franchise in existence would be one of the best? I came into Naruto at the recommendation (or rather pleading) of my brother. This was when I was 12 but I soon dropped it because I couldn't deal with all of the pain and heartbreak that our blond protagonist had to go through. Years passed and this show was always at the back of my mind, I knew I would have to watch it again all the way through this time. Completely by chance, I chose to start it very soon after the main story line ended, i.e. the final (really final) battle between Naruto and Sasuke. As I watched the first series, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of epic battles that I had become accustomed to with shows like Bleach and Hunter x Hunter. But then came shippuden, and boy oh boy did that change. Not only did I get my wish of totally insane fights but I also got a much more emotionally mature series. To be sure, the original has a lot of pain, but they really explored it in shippuden. When all is said and all is done, Naruto really stands out as a series that gives hope for humanity and for yourself. Note that what follows is solely based on the main story arc, I am not considering the story/art/sound/characters/enjoyment of fillers. Story - 9: Really phenomenal. There are very few points where I feel like the story is forced, the reasons for the characters' actions are sound. Though the last bit with ""who was /really/ behind the whole thing"" seemed a little convoluted. The story is really driven by the characters, who are also phenomenal. Art - 9: Naruto Shippuden takes a more modern approach to art than its predecessor did. This is to be expected as the whole series has been going on for about 15 years. The new art style fits the more solemn feel of the series, even though there are points of awkwardness. Sound - 9: The new series brings along a new and improved soundtrack. The new songs are great but aren't outstanding. Characters - 8: They are truly amazing, though many of the women are a bit underdeveloped. It has certainly improved since the first series, but alas, you don't always get what you want. Despite this, the characters really drive the story forward with their lifelike traits. Enjoyment - 10: It is truly an amazing show with truly amazing characters and storylines. Though there are flaws, they are overshadowed by the enormous amount of positivity this show produces. Really, this show will make you an optimist. Overall - 9: Naruto is really an iconic story which deserves recognition, sure, it probably reminds you of when you were a weeb. And yes there are a TON of fillers (but in this day and age, one quick google search can tell you which episodes are fillers, so just avoid them), but Naruto Shippuden (and more broadly the Naruto franchise) is among the best stories of all time.",9,Recommended,"Mar 5, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4d312e23c0,16
"Naruto and consequently Naruto Shippuuden were the first set of anime I ever watched, and overall I am thankful for that. It helped give me a strong baseline for comparing other anime to. Naruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the story of Naruto, a boy ninja in a world called Earth, split into 5 countries, each representing a different element, fire, water, etc. He has grown up a bit from the first Naruto series, after training with a legendary ninja of his Fire country in the interim, and is still interested in furthering his relationship with his brother-in-arms, Sasuke. The story-line, outside of the fillers, is interesting if not a bit predictable, the characters are varied and likable, the music is pretty good, and the creativity behind the various ninja skills is awesome. The problem with Naruto Shippuuden, as was the case with the first Naruto series, is that it is riddled with too many filler episodes, regaling exploits and side-stories of forgettable characters and events. Very few filler episodes are worth watching in my opinion. Overall I'd say Shippudden is worth watching, but only if you have a filler list so that you may skip them.",7,Recommended,"Sep 16, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ef4f3ca711,16
"Even with the filler episodes and with certain events being stretched out for what seems like forever, Naruto Shippuuden still manages to live up to it's reputation. This sequel manages to capture the childish tendencies of the previous installment while adding a new sense of meaningful plot and emotion. While the original series dabbled on this, Shippuuden takes it to a whole new level. This adds a whole new layer to the show, with loads of plot elements adding a new sense of maturity to the show, even if it still is very fun and childish. When it comes to the episodes of filler, while they can be annoying to watch, I believe this doesn't take away from the show. It is very tempting on the first watch to skip the fillers and have plot development. While I completely understand this feeling, I believe that this show shouldn't be dismissed as lesser because of how many filler episodes it has. Even when the plot is not being explored in these episodes, they still manage to be enjoyable even if they serve no purpose in the overall story. But even with this opinion, I understand the want for the story to continue. So if you are the kind of person who watches a show for plot development, maybe skip the filler episodes unless you want to see more of Naruto and his friends kicking some ass. Naruto is one of the series which completely deserves the hype around it. It has amazing characters and an amazing story, with plenty of enjoyment to be found in watching it.

"I do not like this show one bit. Nuh uh. I already hated it once they started doing DBZ shit, because it's Naruto. Naruto is supposed to be ninjas. Instead he turns into fucking fox man McGee and becomes literal Jesus at the end of the series. That isn't what a ninja is. Ninjas are stealthy and cool, not spectacle fighting meatheads. Everything that I liked about the og series was just stripped away with this show. The only thing I liked about the story was the Akatsuki. They were great. Very entertaining, very interesting characters. Pain's arc was also good. I cannot stand the rest of it. If this isn't known by you, I don't skip filler. So I had to sit through all 500 fucking episodes of Shippuden and slowly want to carve my eyes out of their sockets for hours upon end until finally it was over. I'll get into art now. Art: The art is good. No real flaws and the Pain frames are memed too much. Character: Hoo boy. I don't like any of the main characters. Naruto is an imbecile who rarely convinces me to like him and Sasuke is the most whiny, bitch-ass, immature character ever. I don't expect them to be perfect, but at least make them develop. What was Sasuke's development? No, seriously. How the fuck did he develop? He didn't. Not at all. ""He became less broody and immature over the course of the series."" That's bullshit. What about him is mature at all? He's a stupid fucking child, through and through, for the entirety of the series. He isn't cool, he isn't fun, he's just whiny. Itachi is 10x better and I don't even like him that much. My favorite character is Jiraiya because he is somewhat interesting unlike the majority of the cast. But you know what they did with him? They fucking killed him. I get that you need to have the mentor die. But come the fuck on. Why then? Make him die in the war. Minato and Jiraiya coming together in the war arc would have been fantastic to see. Also why did Neji die? He didn't need to. That was a pointless death. It did nothing. Enjoyment: I hate this show. It's long for no reason, it doesn't adapt the manga well, I hate the characters, they stopped doing ninja shit, there are like 200 episodes of filler, Naruto and Sasuke never did and never will entertain me, and have I mentioned that I don't like this show?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 13, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0224368b25,16
"My opinion: story 10/10 It made me cry several times,he was funny whenever he needed to,with a beautiful story animation 8/10 It was not the best but it also had very nice battles aesthetics-sound 9/10 constantly plays with your emotion,It has some things worth a listen and may sound a little funny but changes your view on some things in life (sorry for my English I do not know how to speak and write so well) Recommendations for Similar Series Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood.............. Hunter X Hunter (2011)................ Bleach(2004) few words about the series (naruto,naruto shippuden) ""Naruto is a boy who, on the day he was born, coincidentally had a giant demon fox spirit attack his village. Using a special kind of energy called chakra, a powerful individual sealed this demon fox inside of Naruto to protect the village. Naruto's parents however die in this attack, and he resorts to troublemaking for attention, as well as aspires to become the Hokage, the leader of the village, for people to acknowledge him. To do so, he must become a great ninja, someone who uses their chakra to perform special techniques, such as manipulating the elements to spit fireballs, raise walls of rock, blow gusts of wind that can slice through trees, manipulate the body, or create illusions and trick the opponent. The story of Naruto is about how he grows from a 12 year old low class weak ninja with his friends/classmates and their teachers, including his training to become stronger, personal struggles as well as the ones with the other villages, and fights with strong opponents. It also has his internal conflict with the demon inside of him as well as his attempts to be acknowledged by people as he grows in strength. It constantly has you wondering how things are going to turn out as strategy in combat is critical as they often fight enemies more powerful than they are, and must come up with the strategy to get ahead. Most people find themselves rooting for Naruto as they watch him do what seems impossible as due to his life as an orphan, as well has his overall complete lack of talent in all but a few specific things, has made him vow to NEVER give up, ever, and allows him to see the truth behind his opponents.

"Let's say you're looking for something to be your first anime and you like fighting, well naruto is your thing. This anime has it all there is a little romance there is some action there is character growth there is an interesting power system however the anime is very slow in a normal anime an Arc of naruto would be 12 episodes it is purposely extended to make viewers anticipate the next one more and more and want to watch the next episode. So back on topic naruto is for newbies because once you look naruto the other anime will seem a lot faster and be more to your interests i.e. the anime itself might be 5/10(personal opinion not a fan) however it's worth it for the consequences.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 28, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ce9d605034,16
I am a manga reader and pierrot studio really did massive destruction to my favorite character. Now many people hated sakura because of what studio pierrot did to her. Not all anime watchers read manga like me. Stop damaging other characters for your own goal. I now have a great trust issue in every anime adaptation they release. I had to read the manga before watching it due to what they did to this series. I hate their production. The manga is so good to read and is so satisfying however the anime production is a huge disappointment for me.,5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 7, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2976ee8fa9,16
"Most people forget what Naruto is and what it is meant to be and start comparing it with anime that arrived a decade later. And it's almost impossible to assign numbers and evaluate a series like this one that has been running over a decade. Naruto was never a show made to compete with mind boggling story such as... I don't know let's say Cowboy Bebop for a lack of better example. But it was made in midst of a shounen revolution where the importance was placed on Friendship, goodness, and perseverance. Naruto is very little about ninjas. In fact it's very bad at portraying what ninjas are. But Naruto is creative at least. Taking this ninja genre and combining it into several martial and weapon arts to make this very unique show. Well unique is a bit subjective but whatever. I applaud the series for combining the natural elements, weapons, and even mixing human behaviors to create a world full of unique fighting techniques. Story wise, Naruto is about the character Naruto becoming the leader of his village. He is an orphan cursed with bearing a monster with him and the whole anime is about him overcoming the world of ninjas, which is filled with hatred and suspicion. See the series have some of the most fascinating characters. Each of them with their own background, although many of them could've been kept a secret for the better story progression and pacing. Many of these characters' actions are justified by their past and as the series progresses you can see how each of them changes and influences each other. However the best aspect of the series is also probably the worst aspect of it. While many main characters are given a good amount of attention and care and many of them are nurtured with logic, others just become fodder characters uttering 1 or 2 lines then their worth are never revisited again. The story of Naruto is about never giving up, making friends, and well, whatever standard shounens babble about. But Naruto is one of the few exceptions because Naruto is rarely a hypocrite and actually always stays around its core beliefs. As the series is ending, it's sad that many of the traits of the characters like Sasuke and Obito are reversing and villains are entering the infamous Dragon Ball complex (you enemy becomes bff lol), the main thing is Naruto remains Naruto: stupid and somehow still influential. After watching this series at different intervals and after watching other anime, I came to appreciate Naruto. Because I watched several long running shounen and nothing really even came close to the emotional appeal Naruto formed. I think I can safely say that this show truly keeps it promise and shows Naruto is a hardworking guy who becomes special. However, I still can't forgive this series for wasting the potential of so many characters, random power-ups, unnecessary glorification of Sasuke and Naruto (WE GET IT THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS) and Bleach-esque arse pulls. The fillers are downright horrible and let's not even explore the comedy. Seriously, many of the plot like Kaguya and other backstory could have been omitted, no they should have been omitted, to give Naruto a more refined ending but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Naruto is a good series about a guy never giving up as he faces challenge to save his friend and save his village. Indeed it is a tale of a gutsy ninja. Characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and Pain are some of the noteworthy characters in all of anime. Naruto is a good series on what it stands for. Stop comparing it to high level, 13 episode series because all anime loses its lust after 500 episode mark. On a side note, this is not a proper review. Just whatever I feel about this series. I recommend it for the nostalgia and some really good fight scenes.",7,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_913d4b0353,16
"Do you like Hunter X Hunter and Full metal? Then please promtpy turn around and stay far away from the anime is shit-ru-to. People may tell you, ""No, it's really good"" or ""It's really entertaining"" but those same people would probably tell you ""Manbuns are cool"" or are addicted to minecraft. Watching this anime is like smoking cigarettes. I really wish I could quit, and they're terrible for me, and I can't smoke in public and it isn't as cool as I thought it was going to be, but fuck I just can't stop. I wish I had a nicotine patch for Naruto. A Naruto patch if you will. Let me break it down for you in a step by step. First start smoking: The beginning Yea, all your friends do it, and it looks cool, and that guy from the walking dead smokes and bitches love him right? Well yea, the show is pretty good when it starts off as far as plot goes. You think the plot is really cool, and it is. It's like a mustang gt shelby. You know you like Nissan GTR's more, and you know they are better cars, but there's nothing quite like a mustang. So you watch it, and you keep watching it, and you enjoy it. The effects haven't caught up to you yet. You're enjoying it. The animation is good, great even, and boy the fight scenes and new characters are fucking cool! I mean, deidara and sasori? These akatsuki are badass. oh & look there's itachi, and oh boy, sasuke is back! woah, naruto learns a new power? Woah, demon fights! The animation is kicking ass, the music soundtrack if fucking prime well known and skilled artists and the theme music is pretty good man. Full sails, and you're off. a year of smoking- The middle Okay, it's really not that cool anymore. People have started to tell you you're teeth are getting yellow, and your skin isn't as clear. Oh, and you always smell. And you can't smoke in your car, or in restaurants, and you gotta get up to go smoke and that pisses you off because you're friends are talking shit on you. That's now naruto. You're like, okay, the anime quality has gone down. The art is a bit doofy now, and the animation budget? Did you guys lose a lawsuit? Then there's the fillers. You're like, okay, I guess that one was okay but now this is the 5th one in like 60 episodes, wtf? Then the plot goes way off track and you're like, okay, well I guess it will just get better. So you keep smoking, and say ""fuck all those people. I'll just hang out with smokers from now on"". 2 years of smoking- The end Now you always reek, you can't hang around your nephew, and all your new friends are white trash and smoke newports, and you only smoke camels. You've given up hope, and the doctor says you need to cut back or else. Naruto is now garbage, and you know it is you piece of shit. The animation is laggier than a 1 legged prostitute, and the artwork has been handed over to 12th graders in a graphic design class from somewhere in Upstate Newyork. The plot is now on a different planet, and there's no fucking life there. Good luck finding water fuckhead. Now all your hope is in the music, the only good thing left, and in the remaining characters, which have dwindled down to a small ewok army on the shitty planet that is endor. You don't even enjoy it anymore, you just want it to end. You'll try quitting, but you remember the mange had cool fights and there was that one fight you wanted to see, so you're right back on it, smoking it up. Every episode is a cancer you wish would just explode. You pray for the end of the series with fierce determination that rivals that of a born again christian. Conclusion? I plead dear would be viewers. Don't you fucking dare watch this show. I don't care what your best friend said.

"I don't even know where to begin. When I started watching the original Naruto it was great, tons of potential but once it hit shippuuden it didn't just go down hill, it flew down vertically with no stop in sight. It's depressing to see an anime with a lot of potential be destroyed. As it continues it looks like they are trying to squeeze out all the money possible out of this story instead of just ending it. Many people would disagree with me and a majority wont really give arguments other than being a fan boy but anyway here's my review. Story - Originally the story was supposed to be about a failure ninja who is hated by everyone because of the beast in him. He cries all the time, is extremely annoying to all his peers yet he still blames his beast for being hated. Anyway, the whole plot to this anime is to create bonds, friendships, and get acceptance with the title of ""Hokage"". In the first part of the Naruto series that's exactly what he worked to do and now with shippuuden everything changes, no more bonds, no more friendship, it's just an anime that resembles some sort of animal trade using tailed beasts. Naruto continues to chase sasuke and even after all the advantages hes born with he continues to not be able to catch him. Theres virtually no training in this anime at all, just free powers given over and over. Villains are just a line of people controlling one another. Art - Basic, Average, Modern, not unique. Most of the characters all look like they have been drawn using the same template. Just take off naruto's hair and eyes, throw in sasuke's hair and eyes, BOOM flawless. Sound - The music isn't anything special, usually its an asain man yelling what sounds like ""SEA SAW"" at you with background music. Characters - Not unique, very obvious copy of DBZ. naruto - Easily resembles goku, orange suit, blonde hair, raised by an old guy(hokage), both become monsters with a tail. Only difference is while naruto cried his whole childhood, goku lived alone with innocence. Sasuke - Very obvious copy of vegeta, from the hair, to the death of his whole race and getting revenge. Jiraya - Narutos, frog sage, old, perverted teacher, very similar to roshi, goku's turtle sage, old perverted teacher. Even the way naruto received training was similar, both asked for a large breasted hot girl. Enjoyment - At first it was enjoyable, now it makes you wanna rip your hair out at how ridiculous it is. Overall - 5/10 - and with good reason.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 24, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8f9d2efd88,16
"Naruto is the greatest anime I have watched to date. This anime is all about tragedy and triumph. For every tragedy there is a story of triumph, a story of an underdog overcoming their short-comings and becoming the hero. These tragedies brought me tears and the triumphs inspired me to do amazing things. Never before has anything played with my emotions more than Naruto. Every character has a tragic past, but in the end they are able to overcome their past and become a hero in one way or another. If anything the soundtrack is what tugged and my heartstrings the most. The way the OST was used in every situation made each episode more intense, dramatic or sad. I listen to this OST religiously and even to this day it still brings me to tears and reminds me of the hardships each character went through. I am sitting here struggling to find the words to explain how amazing this anime is but I still feel as if I am not doing Naruto any justice. The endless number of characters and jutsus still amazes me. With every episode there is something new, even the ""fillers"" that people tend to complain about. If you take the fillers seriously then you will learn things about the characters and gain a greater appreciation for them no doubt, especially the side characters. The depth that this series has is hard to grasp because of the numerous generations that this story is told over. The storyline covers centuries of shinobi and how each of their stories effects the next generation, I still have a tough time grasping this theory. Each decision made in Naruto effects the next, whether it is good or bad. Each character is likable in their own special way, even the so called ""villains"" of the show. I wish the anime/manga would never end. Naruto will always have a special place in my heart.",10,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fc8706bab0,16
"My First Review Here. English is not my main language so i may have some mistakes. First of all, the story of Naruto Shippuuden is not perfect and i give it 7 because of the fillers that were unnecessary but without them naruto would not be so popular and the memes around its fillers are amazing.There are some fillers that are good butt others are just so boring and uninteresting. Second, The Art I give it 6 because of Studio Perriot they fucked up a lot of the episodes with bad art and animation but instead they gave us a few rather 100+ episodes or so with good art and animation like episode 322 with Madara. Sound-8-Shippuuden has some of the best anime tracks.I think that a lot of people liked the sound/tracks of the naruto franchise. Characters-7 Team 7 as characters developed a lot through the series.The other characters also had a major development. I like that we can see how the characters change through the series from being a kid who does only trouble to a hero and a legend and most importantly Hokage that is Naruto. Enjoyment-9. Naruto had many amazing fights,sad scenes and funny moments but the fillers ruined a part of the story and the hype.If only the art and animation for some of the fights were better then it'd be perfect but nonetheless i liked every bit of it. Overall-9 I will never Forget Naruto because it was a part of my life for a long time and it will be in the future.Next is Boruto I hope that it'll be as good as Naruto or better.

"SPOILER FREE Shippuden has a GREAT story, but show is garbage because of it's annoying fillers. When the story is really is pacing they meddle with a unrelated episode. So annoying that at some point you will definitely will feel to drop the show. That's why show is hanging in 8 pointer score. BUT if you insist only to root for story and for some characters you will love the show. Story is really twisted, vast and connecting but pacing is slow. They really have great fights really. Some characters are so great that make a great impression. Like Itachi, Madara (you will definitely this guy) Some character will make you puke. Like Sakura or sakura or else sakura. It's a anime worth giving a shot. I only gave this anime decent rating because of story and some great characters. Last thought: Everybody can enjoy this story. If you enjoy this then don't even try to watch ""Boruto"", yeah, like seriously even if you have time that story which took naruto setting for granted and ruined it will only make your day bad.

"The anime is good, I liked it, but there are points where they went wrong. Poorly used characters (that could be fucking harnessed), I also did not like the fact that they used the Edo Tensei just to have the war. And one point I did not like too, is that, from the moment Naruto went into the war, only a single day passed. Also has the fact of the doujutsus, in Naruto Classic, all had the knowledge of two doujutsus, that are respectively, Sharingan and Byakugan. They fucking enjoyed the Sharingan, until Magekyo appeared in the classic and taus, but nothing said that they could summon a megazord. I know these things are secret and blablabla, but, do you really think they were thinking about these things when they created the Sharingan? (In this case Kishimoto). But, like I said, I liked the anime, the anime story until it was good ... Until the war started, that sucked. I also liked the fights, the important moments and the appearance of the Akatsuki, the Plot.

"This may be a hot take but I do not find Naruto to be a very well written character. He has no character growth throughout the show and you always know what he will do. It makes the show agonizingly predictable. Also many main cast characters such as Sakura are also very poorly written. Its also a shame because Naruto has some of the most well written characters in all of anime, but they are surprisingly under covered in the story. Secondly the show does a great job making a very interesting story between Sasuke and Naruto (although I think its a bit under-covered). Also the story behind Itachi is truly a written masterpiece. Overall the main thing the story has going for it is that the writers did a great job of making lovable characters. You are hooked to the anime to see if the characters will succeed. And in the end they do. But now... yall know I was going to talk about this... Fillers... Okay so... If I take away the fillers I would rate naruto probably a 8 or 9. But the sheer antagonizing fillers brings this show all the way to a 5. If you calculate. 47% of this entire show is filler. Let that sink it. Even if you have a filler guide, near the end the fillers all have some vital info so you need to watch SMH.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d693411f80,16
"Naruto Shippuden one of the most captivating animes I have seen. Out of the few animes I have completed I'm glad I made it to the finale of Naruto but let's get to the review now. Story- Naruto Shippuden has a really detailed story at times the pacing isn't the greatest but overall I think they did a good job. Many people will say there's to much ""filler"" but to me there are many cool stories told in them and even sometimes things that could have been apart of the manga like when the akatsuki caught the 3 and 6 tails. Speaking of the akatsuki what an amazingly well written villain group and there motivations are well explained especially later when introduced to Madara. Madara might be the best written villain in anime I say might because I haven't finished many anime yet. This story is fantastic and many more that are considering Naruto Shippuden I would definitely recommend it. 10/10 Character Development- There's alot of development for characters from Naruto to Filler Characters. Naruto goes from an outcast and hated by the village to proving himself and earning the respect and love of all the leaf (even though he could have turned on them). Kakashi goes from someone struggling with depression and at fault not seeing any happiness to being able to forgive himself and be a leader for young ninjas in Konoha. Itachi goes from being someone that was precieved as a murderer and awful human to being someone who ultimately did anything he could for his brother and village. The only characters that didn't see any development were Sakura and Sasuke in my opinion. 8/10 Animation- The animation was pretty solid throughout and really shines at the most crucial moments. 8/10 Overall- Naruto Shippuden is an amazing anime with consistently good animations and an amazing story that gives most of its characters great spotlight to become more fleshed out and complete the only thing that should have happened and didn't was Naruto becoming the Hokage at the end but it makes since as he was still a genin (even though he's Kage Level). 9/10",9,Recommended,"May 10, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d1e58e1f4c,16
"One of the best animes there is Naruto is recognized as one of the faces of anime and one of the big 4 for a reason. ill give a short review on the story, characters, and fighting below. i'll do this without spoiling :D Story: the story of Naruto is very well thought out. It has a red line and the villains and their objectives stay the same while simultaneously evolving as we progress with the story. Naruto and the other characters have a lot of growth and as they grow their opponents are scaled with them. meaning in the beginning when Naruto is still not that strong he does not really face the end boss level characters. it feels very organic how the power scaling is increased, its not like ""he defeated the boss here is another boss who is 10x stronger"" but instead he fights weaker opponents while growing, or he has help by strong allies. as the story progresses they get stronger and can handle stronger foes. There is also some drama aspects touching on topics like forgiveness, revenge, love and other stuff. this makes the series even better. when they touch on the characters lives it makes the series more personal to the viewer and not just some slop you watch and forget. There is however one flaw that the series has and its the fillers. since the story was not complete the animators had to create filler episodes which can get a bit tedious. I watched them all haha but truth be told sometimes i wished they didnt use them since back when i watched it i saw the new episodes weekly. 41% of the show is fillers. theres a LOT you learn about the characters that is not included in the source but that they added, some of it is worth it some not. if you don't have patience since the story is already very long, look up guides on which episodes are complete fillers and which ones are half filelr half story and try to watch only the story and the story-filler episodes. Its definitely worth it Characters: all characters are so well thought out, everyone has a unique personality and all the important characters have so much growth. if you watch the original Naruto and Shippuden then you feel like you grow up with these characters and you really root for your favourites, and you feel sad when some of them die. The show does a wonderful job expanding on the already existing characters while also introduing new ones all the time. sometimes they swap the main characters squad members, but its always under very non-forced conditions that atually are needed to progress the story. like if a character is hurt and is healing then that character is replaced with a substitute for some time. or since this is Shippuden, as everyone knows, Sasuke is no longer part of team 7, so they get a third member. Not that there is a lot of team 7 activities lol Fighting: the fighting is another aspect that makes the series shine just like the story and the characters do. the fighting scenes are really good, there is a giant variation of different attacks and every characters (expect background ones) have their unique fighting styles. it never gets boring. everytime a new character is introduced you get excited to find out how that person fights. even though the series has a lot of big moves and super strong attacks it still feels a little realistic in the sense that a cut wound will cut and that characters can die. its not like they will take giant attacks to the face, bounce a 100 times, hit some wall and just get up (unless they have some protective layer or something lol). Its important that the characters actually dodge the attacks, which is why substitution jutsus and dodging skills are something most characters also have. a lot of characters use different ways to avoid attacks as well which gives the combat another layer of exitement. its not only unique offensive skills but unique defensive skills as well. so the viewer is left thinking ""how will he survive"" as well as ""how will he defeat his opponent"" most times someone fights. except the people with plot armor the series is not so forgiving to attacks. some very strong character could lose his arm in a random fight agains another character, and then have to fight the rest of the series with only one arm for example. although most of these injuries and deaths do not happen to the collective ""main characters"" which basically are the people from the same generation as the main character. they survive most fights and its other filler characters who are introduced later on that get all misforture overall: 10/10 across. the only downside is that the show consists of 41% filler episodes",10,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1fdee68a64,16
"Naruto shippuuden could have been a really good anime, but, after a while in the anime they start using flashbacks, and not a few.

"I have been sa watcher of Naruto for over three years now, and I must say, it has changed A LOT! Allow me to explain. Story: The Story overall is kind of good. I like the whole original idea of Ninjas being the supreme beings in the world and like to kick each others asses just to show off their powerful swirling balls of air. In fact, sometimes it was SO original, that I couldn't even keep up with the huge cluster fuck of plot twists and new characters that were popping up in between canon and filler arcs. Since I made I to that part, let's talk abouit the fillers. YAAAAAYYY! We all luv um. I lied, I hate them actually. And Naruto's fillers are SOO BAD that I, at one point, dropped the anime for a year, came back a year later, and they have only advanced 20 episodes of Canon. The gap between canon and filler is so small now. There is new BORING filler arc every month. It is PATHETIC!!! Art: The art for the anime was pretty good at the beginning of the series. The character design was complex and different, but as the series progressed, the art became lazier and lazier. Did you see the art for the Pein Arc? Holy Shit, what a fucking mess. And its only been worse from there. I'm scared that its going to turn into fucking Lucky Star five years from now. And we all know its going to last that long too, so shut up. Sound: All of the openings are also lazily done including the transitional music. They all sound the fucking same! The first Naruto series before Shippuden was pretty gifted in its music. Sadness and Sorrow was a really good song. One of my favorites, but it all went downhill from there. Character: There are s many characters, and surprisingly, I've managed to memorize all of their names. It's pretty amazing, . But seriously, thatsd the problem. Theres just too many.

I maybe would have enjoyed the fillers more if the where before the war, or just in some more OVA's those happen during the war, My naruto rate dropped from 9 to 6.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 4, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_253161f98c,17
"I will always have a soft spot for Naruto Shippuden. I practically grew up watching it and let me tell you, it was not just a cartoon for me, it was an a history with many lessons, the formation of those lessons and life as well and then, some very good tips on becoming brave, striving on and most importantly, friendship. Beginning or rather ending with the first episode towards the last one, Naruto Shippuden is absolutely amazing and there is no better way to express this rather highly by fiddling the emotional strings of the die-hard fan. The centre of this Changing formula is in character development, notably in the case of the protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto’s many stages of growth and development would also contain such changes the most important one being the transition from undesirable to stubborn and prominent teen-hero intending to be the Hokage once within his lifetime which was quite well motivating. Easier said than done. It is not merely a physical endurance but also a active resolution to stop difficulties and a battle waged within oneself that in the end makes a person out of the weak boy. Moreover, he seeks for reasons to walk the path he has never stepped before, awakes at the sit of turmoil and the heat of the matter sort of thing, and anger towards the external enemy gets repressed— a fact for which there is no room in the epic, and all these qualities do not let the reader forget the character of that boy. Furthermore, the show explores these characters and their bonds further like every other shounen anime or manga does, each with their own story. These three and the rest known are not just flat figures, they are also very talented and intelligent individuals who had great deal of learning and want to have certain values. My enemies in good movies and reading really battles and flip these enemy attitides. The growth of Naruto’s relationship with each of these people, in particular his bond with Sasuke along with the rivalry, is one where one can not take his eyes off the screen. Adding to the fact that Naruto Shippuden tops all other in terms of high production-value action scenes and strong fighting performances, it also has exceptionally high quality pre-written dialogue for the performances. The details of the fights are beautifully evocative, yet most notably these action scenes are very effective in their delivery of tension. It’s not just the content of each dangerous bout that feels substantial – either against fearsome opponents or battlefields filled with military conflict – but the stakes as well, because every fight is significant and not only for the purpose of showing different abilities. Yasuharu Takanashi, the composer for the show, also did all of the soundtracks, most of which were loud when played and made Naruto Shippuden a highly emotional show. Every emotional instant is enhanced with the skillfully composed songs including the famous theme songs and the mystifying background music, established an extremely strong bond with the viewer making the playback of the show enjoyable fully. I can say with confidence, that for me. Naruto Shippuden wasn’t only an anime that I loved - it is a series that many I northern crumpled, watching it along growing up and hence this fact holds several alright memories. It has episodes that evoked my emotions, others made me laugh, and somewhere in between them I had to review my life’s ideals like how much loyalty is important, how some kind of stiff adherence to faith and resolve is wrong and how it’s wrong to abandon all one’s dreams… Such a show is motivational and it will remain a fond memory and a part of me. I would most certainly rate Naruto Shippuden as a 10/10. It is not just a piece of work but a piece of art because for people, me as well, that have a certain age this is a part of them, the part that they grew up with.",10,Recommended,"Oct 5, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_082b0b46a8,17
"03:53 AM 😭2024/12/31🤧 The best anime in the world has ended. Thank you Kishimoto Naruto. I have been following it since I was 9 years old. My favorite childhood anime. We followed the story of Naruto from when he was a child until his marriage. Of course, these are happy moments thanks to the sacrifices of many From characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and others, it had a very satisfying ending, although I am sad that my favorite character, Itachi, died sadly and did not witness happy moments like these.The characters were well written, the drawings were beautiful, and the plot was flawless.

"This series was a disaster. Right from the start I was already annoyed when Naruto was screaming SASUKE but I never realized that would basically sum up the Story of Shippuden. The series started getting dull because of the characters, the animation and the story also, I'm not saying that this series didn't have AWESOME moments but unfortunately, there are more bad moments than good ones. The few Naruto fans that I know, told me that they stopped watching Shippuden out of frustration and honestly I don't blame them BUT by the end, the show redeems itself and I would say that aside from the little flaws that annoy me, the end is pretty satisfying. If you watched Naruto, you have to watch Shippuden in order to get some closure so my advice is avoid the filler and prepare to be surprised and for a few disappointing moments.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_101f9a5ef5,17

"The story is absolutely beautiful. You have epic fights combined with deep emotions and unpredictable story changes that will blow your mind. Marvelous. There are dozens of different characters and every one is unique. Even the side characters have distinguishable features, and the main characters show a character depth that many Hollywood movies could learn from nowadays. Let's take the villain Orochimaru for example. He is easily the most well-designed antagonist I have seen in any motion picture, even in all the books I read I can't find a character like him. Pure evil. Cunning, bizarre, and frightening. On top of his unpredictable actions and twisted motives, the music appearing together with him just rounds up the presentation of this character, and to me, makes it unforgettable.

"In my opinion, Shippūden surpasses the original Naruto in some ways. Both are amazing shows, so what you favor more is up to you. Whether you decide on that or not, it is undeniable that Naruto Shippuden is a very successful and strong follow up to Naruto. It further explores the depth of many characters old and new. My favorite thing about this show is how each antagonist hardly feels like a villain. I was touched by their philosophies and how each compared to Naruto, the classic “bring peace to the world” guy. My only complaints with the show were the dragging out of the Great Ninja War. This show, for me, was a 10/10 until the War. It was a good arc, BUT I found myself struggling to get through it towards the end.

"I have watched Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden as a child and loved the action, now that I am older an have been watching anime for many many years (17) out of the hundreds of shonen anime, Naruto takes the first place prize! you can watch Naruto simply for the action, but you can dig much much deeper into the characters past and see their development, as well as see the wonderful meaning behind the story, the depth of some characters truly amazes me, and the mystery is not lacking either! You truly feel like your there experiencing these characters emotions as well as the story first hand! This is a great first anime especially! I cannot tell you how many people have gone from hating anime to loving it because I recommended Naruto series to them. I consider my self a seasoned veteran when it comes to shonen anime, and I am pretty picky about what I consider 10/10, but Naruto hits the ball out of the park!! Even the 3rd time I watched the series all the way through, there was STILL things that I did not even think about and mystery to uncover. IF you have not watched Naruto I suggest you do, stick with it and really look at the whole show (depth, story, characters, plot, theme) or just stick around for the fights, up to you either way you will not be disappointed! The last thing I will leave you with is, if you really do not like filler, skip the Naruto fillers and go back and watch them at a later time. A lot of them are really funny, JUST MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUALLY FILLER! some episodes are cannon/filler mix!",10,Recommended,"Apr 16, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7510f2a127,17
"The sequel to Naruto's first part is bigger, better, and most definitely worth your time. This is an anime every anime fan should see, a timeless masterpiece. There's a reason Naruto is part of The Big 3 Shounens. Like all anime and manga it has its shortcomings, so I'll talk about what's good and what's not. Overall however, this is beyond phenomenal. First off, if you want the best experience watching Naruto: skip all the fillers. And I mean all of them. I'll talk about that later. I don't even know where to start with why I love this masterpiece. As if the 'original' Naruto series wasn't already fantastic Shippuden cranks things up to 100; mostly for the better. The 220 episodes of Naruto hyped up the Akatsuki, and they sure as hell delivered Characters: I've never seen more 10/10 characters in one anime. Shippuden introduces almost double the amount of important characters and they all are beyond amazing. It just gets better as you watch. Fights: 10/10. Easy. Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Jojo tier-fights. Apart from some of them being a bit drawn out these are some of the most logical, entertaining, consistent, and emotional fights. Plot & Filler: The canon plot is slightly drawn out, especially the last arc of Shippuden, but it nonetheless is a 10/10. The characters, fights, plot twists, and everything in between are so addictive and fun to watch. Now filler. 'Older' animes used to add a bunch of filler, god knows why, and naruto is certainly one of them. Over 200 episode in Shippuden are filler. Two. Hundred. And they are horrible, just like part 1 of Naruto. Don't do what I did and sit through every one of them, it's not worth it. Skip all of it, genuinely only 8 or so episodes out of the 300 naruto filler episodes spanning this and part one are worth it: The Kakashi Mask episode (part 1) and Kakashi's Anbu arc. Overall: 9.8/10 There's a reason Naruto is and will forever be one of the most popular and highly loved anime of all time. A must watch for anyone who finished part 1, and if you haven't seen part 1 you should. It's incredible.

"Here we have a world that holds quite an immersive story which not only advances over time, but even events of the world's past end up building up the events that took place in the story's present era. As for the characters (ignoring filler characters) we saw a lot of them grow up over time (especially due to the use of the time skip) as well as see just how corrupting a tale of revenge can be. Though of course we'll always have our complaints on some things ('Useless' Sakura and Sasuke only paying an arm for his actions), but they don't really do much damage to the series overall. So great series overall...but the only real downside in my opinion would be the sheer amount of fillers in this and its predecessor (Naruto).

"Many of you will maybe be surprised of why i gave Naruto: Shippuden a 10/10, and trust me, i don't understand 100% either... To be completely honest, I would never say this was the best anime of all time, my rating is more personally. Anyways.. Story: The story in Naruto is good, and just amazing, no doubt about that. The story never really got boring for me, it kept becoming even better. I would say that it is one of the best stories in anime, and I really recommend watching it if you love good stories. Animation: The animation overall isn't bad at all, but when it came to fight scenes it went a little off at times, and the reason for it was simply just for their choice of style in some fights (Which happens a lot in anime, not just Naruto). But most of the fights are amazingly animated, and I'll watch them again. Fillers: I know damn well that Naruto has many goddamn fillers, and many of them are below average.. But I really don't want to rate an anime for their fillers, and I don't understand why people trash talk it this much. If you don't like it, then most of them are 100% skippable. Personally I choose to just watch them. And no, I did not enjoy them, but a couple of them were fairly okay. Music and sound: The music in the original Naruto is good, but had some that were under decent. In Naruto: Shippuuden all opening are and just the music in the episodes are great. I really liked and enjoyed it all. Character: The characters in Naruto is outstanding, i would say it's at least in top 10 animes with the best characters, maybe top 5. All tho the villains and main characters are made greatly, there were some characters that they missed too much potential in, and that really annoys me. The character development is great, but it could have been much better. They really went carefully when choosing people to die, but to be honest, they didn't choose enough. And it could have made it even better. There were too many characters, and so you would have expected a lot of them to die, but apparently not. Ending: I can't really say the ending was perfect, but i wouldn't say it wasn't good either. It became a little rushed at the end, but i think it worked out okay. Sub or Dub?: I watched it in Sub, and i also think Sub is the better choice. I didn't watch dub, but i watched a little of it, and i liked it. They were both made finely. Overall: I gave it a 10/10, which is very overrated, i know i know. But personally, i can't stop giving it 10. The Anime just hit me differently. But if i had to give it a rating outside that, I'll give it a 8/10. Maybe 7,5/10. Also, the anime was also really carried by the story. The best elements of the show are the music/sound, characters, story, and personally the plot too, even tho the plot can be basic at times.",10,Recommended,"Oct 12, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8dc92adc4a,17
"Oh, Naruto. An anime that you never thought would never end. I've seen shonen anime like this where it's essentially a story about someone wanting to be something in their future, as well as something more compared to others who have tried. Part 1 dealt with the whole idea of strategy vs talent. It made you feel inspired to go out into the world and essentially be who you want to be and not be limited by anything out there. The concept of it's possible no matter what anyone else says. Shippuden aka Part 2 is different and in that, it's focus was more on the world of Naruto rather than the actual character. Sure, Naruto Shippuden has interesting characters but the focus was obviously more on how they were (their backstories) rather than their present life. Sure, events transpire and they're still awesome to look at.. but when you look at it, it's like Naruto Shippuden became more interested in adding characters rather than actually developing them. Sure, they did but it felt very slow. It's not something bad just something. Quantity over Quality even though Shippuden does have its moments. In fact, this whole idea of Shippuden being very different and somewhat lost what made it special reminds me of the shift from the first 3 Fast and Furious movies all the way to the ""now"" which are completely action with less racing. The only outward thing I can say about Naruto Shippuden is that it's a lesson on how a writer can have problems when something they've created has become so huge that it's completely messy. Don't get me wrong, I like the characters as well as the overall story. But the way it was told was a little slow. Not only that, but this particular show is littered and cursed by filler. It's technically a meme that Naruto Shippuden is known mostly by its messy filler in between the stories that make it good and to be honest, that's what sad about it. Naruto has always been a story where you can pretty much feel emotion running through you especially since the writer/author is good at conveying emotion through his fights. However, because of Shonen Jump's harsh schedule, it ruined his draftsmanship and overall, ruined the anime. Nevertheless, Shippuden is undoubtedly a phenomenon. With iconic villains and characters as well as notable abilities and moments with amazing conclusions in its stories. This had a great finale to something so huge that it can be comparable to Harry Potter's Deathly Hallows and the MCU's Endgame. Every segment in Naruto is an event; An idea that Boruto or any anime might never, or might not be able to replicate ever again. It's an anime that meant to a lot of people and it will never be forgotten. However, like life itself; it had to end. And while it ends, you can feel the emotion through each final episode. And it shows that the writer, while he had his flaws, is truly a talented and amazing writer.

"Naruto is a series that a lot of people enjoy, my self-included at one point. That opinion changed however upon a second view of the series as a whole. While the many flaws that exist within this show could be repeated, they are ultimately mute as the real problems that exist in this show are most prevalent in it's story/character direction and its predictability. Naruto is a story that set itself up from the very beginning as a tale about a nobody coming from nothing and struggling to become the greatest so as to earn the respect and acknowledgement of his peers and those in his community. It is a decent plot, one that has been unfortunately been beaten like a dead horse throughout shonen for the past several decades. As many know upon the completion of Shippuden however, that idea went out the window. Naruto is revealed to have been the reincarnation of the Christ analog of his universe as he and the rest of the main cast of heroes and villains are ushered into the levels of godhood that no other ninja regardless of effort could hope to replicate. Many state that this is where Naruto lost sight of its identity but I argue something more introspective. It never had one. Naruto has always had the Nine-Tails inside of him since episode one, a mass of chakra with whom there are no contenders. Naruto uses the Nine-Tails to overcome every fight in the series in some way, shape, or form with one (arguably two) exceptions. Unfortunately, that isn't rising from nothing. That's taking the worlds greatest advantage and using it like a crutch instead of bettering yourself but then passing it off as of own efforts born of sweat, blood, and tears. If you took the Nine-Tails away from Naruto or created a situation where he couldn't bulldoze his way through a fight with virtually unlimited power, I can guarantee you that Naruto would lose and his opponent would be uninjured. All of his efforts only amount to him getting beat up on screen for ten minutes until he decides to end his fights with his signature technique, the Nine-Tails, or a combination of the two. You could watch all the fights that transpired with Naruto and 99.8 of them end this way. It gets to the point where fans of the series already know in the back of their mind how a fight is going to end before it even starts. Beyond that, the cast suffers from Bleach syndrome, in that the series has way too many side characters and jutsu and doesn't develop a majority of them beyond the surface level. The main cast is okay. I don't dislike Sakura and though she can be infuriating at times, I regard her as just another shonen woman who is doing her best to contribute to a series that primarily doesn't need her. I found Sasuke interesting, even for rival archetypes as his role is primarily undefined by Naruto which is good. Barring some moments where he acted out of character through the later half of the series, I was at least invested in his story. Kakashi is a great character with whom I probably never would have gotten through Naruto if he was not there. His role as the group mentor however was not the best as he is quickly abandoned by all three main characters midway through the series and is then out right replaced during a particular arc only to note upon his return that his students have surpassed him and don't need him anymore when they arguably have never needed him. The series also falls victim to key events that are ultimately made contrived to the point of insanity for the sake of preserving continuity and plot holes so gaping, I'm surprised they haven't imploded the series into several, conjoining black holes. I don't hate Naruto, as it is a series that does it's job in entertaining viewers (to an extent) but I can't help but feel as though it failed to tell the story it wanted to tell. Even part of the end goal is not even addressed until another (less popular) spin-off which cheapens the adventure that viewers invested their time in to see. While I would not recommend this series to anyone curious, I will not deter them from doing so as Naruto is an undeniably an experience but one that may leave you feeling disappointed and cheated.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 11, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_999e0220af,17

"Naruto shippuuden is one of the best anime series ever made. This is the first time i am reviewing an anime series ,i have watched more than 70 anime series yet but my first review had to be naruto because i grew watching this ,i have learned so much about real life from it ,my ideal my way of thinking has been influenced by naruto.I can't tell how much i have cried watching this show ,there are just so much emotions in this show ,that u can feel every character .I can't remember how much i cried watching naruto ,the music is just too good it will make you crying and still now when i watch naruto (after 6 years of finishing it) it still make my eyes wet.This show gives great message which are applicable in real life. Lets start the review by talking about the story ,Naruto shippuden has one of the best story written ever , a normal human can never think of such a great story ,the story of naruto shippuuden is its root ,the base of the show .Its a very emotional and motivating story. The story will not disappoint you .The story is so well connected with past and present the characters are so well jumbled up with the plot ,every characters have significant role .Every character is given so well background and there are so many great characters thats y people have liked so many characters other then main characters .i definitely recommend watching this show because the story is just so good with every element like emotions ,hatred ,rage , sacrifice ,love and much more that this story is just so much worth watching.This fact is to be noted that the base of the story are taken from real world legends ,like the concept of chakra ,the kaguya princess ,indra-ashura , which i think is really a great work. The animation studio did a brilliant job in this show ,this much good that some of the current show are not able to .Let me say naruto series have one the best fight scene ever made ,and the intelligence and chorography is amazing in the fight is just too great. Another best thing of naruto is the music ,i will not say that it has one of the best music work because it has the best music work i believe ,the music is just too awesome believe me ,the opening and ending are soo soo good that they will stay alive even after the show has ended not every op and end is great but most of them are amazing. The emotional theme ,from moment to moment really hype me up , seriously the work on music wheather it op and ed or the theme everything is just too too good ,no matter what words i pick i can never appreciate them enough. Naruto is definitely every emotional show ,but that's not all about it there is great comedy in it which makes us laugh out loud , memorable battle scene are there ,so many great quotes of different character that we can realize in our life ,its not just a show when u watch it ,u live it ,deeper and deeper u can fell in this show ,u can feel the emotions and they are so realistic ,which makes u cry like hell ,i think when we cry watching a show then it means the author was able to convey u what he wanted .its not just a show for me ,its a feeling ,a feeling that i love very much ,i really wish that all the memories of this show gets deleted so that i can watch it again ,feel the way i used to ,cry the way i used to ,be excited about those suspense. Lets talk about the drawback of the show ,even when it's one of the most amazing show ever made ,still it has too many drawbacks , everyone knows about it that it has too many fillers ,which is one the biggest problem also the reason of low rating ,just too many fillers. If they could remove the fillers and releasing separately then i am sure naruto could have been in top 10 list. I can keep on writing about this anime , because it made me feel that deeply but i will end it here. Thank you so so much for giving us such awesome show , really appreciate the author of the show ,the whole studio ,all the music work ,all the hard work is really appreciated thank you so much for giving us naruto.",10,Recommended,"Jul 2, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3e15a16f73,17
"God I hated this whole series.... *spoilers ahead* 1.Bad Character development of girls especially. 2. No reason to hate Naruto bcoz he is a jinchuriki. Yes, he being hated for being mischievous is fine. But throwing stones at him and all was just too much. I would question the mindset of Leaf village of the people once lead by Hashirama. 3. No concrete reasons for Madara for doing what he does. Why does he want to make world better by putting everyone in The Matrix? (except Pain and Orochimaru their reasons were best). 4. Plot holes and unexplained power ups at the end. 5. Fillers....sooo many horrible filers And here my major reasons- When you have created such a huge world it is important to explore that (especially 5 great nations). There was no proper exploring of the entire shinobi world, the various customs, history, etc. Most important- why create the whole concept of Jinchuriki and Tailed beasts and show only two of them properly (Bee and Naruto, I am not even counting Gara). I wanted to know all Jinchuriki names, powers and back stories and most importantly see their all out fights with akatsuki and others. Also don’t each of the tailed beats have some special power that even their jinchuriki can use? (other thab TB bombs and chakra cloak). Most important#2 Do all cool and badass clans live in Konoha? I wished to see other village clans and their keke genkais. But as i said there was no exploring. Deidara and kisame were only good other village ninjas for me. Why make the 7 swordsmen of mist if not going to show each properly. Only Zabuza and Kisame are shown all cool. All of them should've been cool and shown in all out fight against protagonists and other characters and be in the story. Also, other than Kisame’s and Zabuza’s swords others were not that cool. Samehada was way too cool. All 7 should be equal badass swords. Other villages top fighting forces should’ve been shown. Just like 7 Shinobi swordsmen. Rock Lee was done bad, he had potential to be awesome! Might Guy should’ve died. His death would’ve been very impactful. Seems his life is just a pitiful drag on now on a wheel chair. Orochimaru should’ve remained evil. Who doesn’t want an ultimate evil genius? He should’ve been one of the ultimate villains. And also if possible he should have been a major threat in Boruto too. Uchiha clan became too Strong due to Sussano power. I wish it was a Rinnegan specific power. Reanimation in the end was not following rules. Madara could do just whatever he wants. It seemed a bit like plot device. The Otsutsuki clan should’ve been hyped from the start (of Naruto series) and a proper back story for origins of chakra and Ninjutsu should’ve been given- step by step. So when Kaguya finally makes her appearance it would look cool. In all Naruto had all the potential to be the best anime ever. Awesome fight scenes and great animation but if you had the huge budget you should of hired better writers",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 15, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ae4cb1cb05,17
"Shippuden is literal fillers to the characters past. But incase you're skipping all the fillers,it's an enjoyable series. Plenty of likeable characters even though Naruto is still cringy to watch :/. I remember so many of the OP's in Naruto because it's just that good. The character development is tolerable,I suppose. The story feels rather slow at times,but it's alright for a shonen anime. In my personal opinion,the Pain arc is the best. Nothing can top that. The action is nice but not that amazing. Naruto:Shippuden is an alright anime at it's core but it can be enjoyable if you're into this kind of stuff. Just don't go expecting great character development or an amazing story cause this anime doesn't have it.",7,Recommended,"Jun 28, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9b49128b2b,18
"Story: You can break the story of Naruto Shippuden down into one sentence. Naruto's best friends Sasuke Uchiha did fall on the ""dark side"" and Naruto himself is a great bro so he does everything to bring him back without ever givin up. Sounds pretty boring doesn't it? Well while the story progresses the whole thing gets a lot more complicated. Naruto and his friends would have to face several ""bad guys"", train a lot to be able to beat them and lose a lot of precious people (very emotional! :( ) and the great thing about it is that everything actually connencts. Talking about the bad guys...they aren't actual bad guys and this is something I liked a lot about Naruto. Usually they are just people who had a really rough live and therefore developed some ""bad"" but pretty logical philospohy. For example one enemy believed that it is impossible to understand one another except if everyone understands one another's pain. And to understand pain you must experience pain so he became the bad guy to spread pain over the world. During Naruto's fight against that person they had quite an interesting philosophical conversation- something that the series does a lot. The only negative aspect about the sotry is that some of the so called filler episodes (episodes that don't really provide anything to the plot but are pretty important to have a deeper understanding for the character's development aka episodes that you won't find in the Manga) are really bad placed. For example during one of the most intence arcs of the show we got Fillers from OG Naruto- without any logical reason!! My personal opinion is that you should still watch them but you can decide that for yourself (there are filler lists in the internet). 9/10 Art: On one hand some of the greatest most memorable fights in Anime history and some really weird animations due to outsourcing of the animation studio but overall pretty solid. 8/10 Sound: Let's be real on this one. Naruto Shippuden's OST is one of the greatest of all time.

Why you might ask? Well simply because all of them are very interesting and most of them have quite a depth due to their past and their actions during the story. The characters will stick to you and if you actually think about them you might learn some valuable lessons about life. Enjoyment: I loved it and felt a vast emptiness after I finished the series and the movies. Overall: For me a 10/10.

"Careful Spoilers It is very hard for me to rate this show because ass many many people in the world I liked a lot the pre-Pain death show, but after that the show and the manga is pure crap, the war is way too long and way too boring, and the flashbacks.... don't get me started with the flashbacks, they are annooying even in the manga. Dear Masashi Kishimoto it could be way better if instead of soo many boring af flashbacks you created a spin-off precuel with all the flashbacks. The show goes badly towards the end because the final boss if f*** Madara, please men let the dead characters rest, the worst of it is that the resurrected characters are key to the story, and this is just awful.

"I enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden because I believe it had a very complex story which stood out from any other animes I have watched before.All of the characters had a background story and an episode for it which were usually a bit boring but could sometimes be interesting.I really enjoyed it because although it had side stories it always reverted back to Naruto trying to get Sasuke back.The Naruto franchise also have a very enjoyable sound track in the background for fights,memories or just sad moments.The artwork in this anime was outstanding according to my standards because I like Masashi Kishimoto's style of drawing when it comes to the hairstyles and backgrounds.In conclusion,I believe Naruto Shippuuden is an emotional and enjoyable anime for all otakus!!! （ミ￣ー￣ミ） <-NARUTO!!!",9,Recommended,"Feb 6, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3fa494c68b,18
"One of the most overrated anime in the century. I understand that the manga could appeal to a lot of people but frankly, the anime was really bad. I have counted in total 223 filler episodes on 500. Don't you think that almost half of the episodes of the anime is way too much? Moreover, 90% of these filler were not interesting at all. I know that they put it there so the anime doesn't catch up to the manga but it was way too unsatisfying. It is because of these filler that I dropped the anime for a long time. The art was not bad, I mean some jutsu were kind of original and pretty. The OST/Openings were good too. If they had just put the manga stuff, I would probably rate it with 8/9 but the way they handled the anime was bad. NB: The characters were not really interesting, some characters were really likeable like Jiraya, Minato, Naruto, Shikamaru,... but on all the characters(those that we know the name at least) I was able to like only 5-8%.

It has fantastically deep and dimensional characters, the fights (while I see why others think differently) look gorgeous, and lastly, it truly puts the time into forming the plot and doesn't feel rushed.

"With how much love Naruto Shippuden gets—aside from maybe its final arc—I'm personally surprised the time skip (or Shippuden, as the anime calls it) isn’t criticized more for its actual issues. I’m not talking about the anime’s slow pacing and filler—that’s been talked about to death. I mean problems that were in the manga itself and just carried over into the anime. That said, I should be fair and explain my perspective—why I was disappointed, but also what I did like about Shippuden. In general, I prefer pre-time skip Naruto. Not only was the cast decently sized without feeling bloated, but the tone had a good mix of lightheartedness, magic, and actual strategy. However, due to the events of the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, it’s understandable that Shippuden lost much of its whimsical charm. Even the soundtrack feels more serious and somber. That’s one thing Shippuden does well—consistently emphasizing tragedy. And, oh boy, there’s a lot of it. While pre-time skip Naruto fumbled with who the real villains were from arc to arc, Shippuden at least has solid villain buildup. Almost every major conflict connects to a larger antagonist, which helps the story feel more cohesive. I also think Naruto (the character) himself improved. Pre-time skip Naruto had some nice moments but was generally a bit too annoying for me. Post-time skip, he’s more tolerable and has more memorable moments, though he can still be frustrating and occasionally bland. And while there aren’t as many as I’d like, Shippuden does have some great emotional moments. Some are tied to backstories, but a few present-day scenes stand out and keep things memorable. Unfortunately, that’s about where my positives end. One of my favorite things about pre-time skip Naruto was its balance of magic (ninjutsu) and strategy. Unfortunately, Shippuden gradually reduces the importance of ninja tactics, making fights feel like they’re decided purely by who has the strongest jutsu. Strategy occasionally appears, but it’s subtle—sometimes too subtle. This made many action scenes duller than they should have been. Sure, there are some cool set pieces and hard-hitting moments, but when everyone is just spamming super-powerful ninjutsu, and things like shuriken, bombs, and taijutsu barely matter (outside of that one insane Might Guy moment), it really shows how much power creep affected the fights. Even in pre-time skip Naruto, some characters were already being pushed to the background despite having cool designs or moments. Shippuden takes this issue and dials it up to 100. So many characters we got to emotionally connect with—or at least see do something cool—get shafted. Asuma, Kurenai, Choji, Shino, Anko, Rock Lee, Neji, Tenten—the list goes on. These were characters we got to know as early as the second arc, yet in Shippuden, they barely do anything. The only exceptions are a few obvious fan favorites like Shikamaru, Gaara, and I guess Hinata—but that’s about it. You’d think the Fourth Great Ninja War Arc would be the perfect time to make all these characters relevant again, and the series tried, but in my opinion, it fumbled hard. Why? Because there were too many characters introduced on top of an already large cast. Not only do we still have all the Leaf Village ninjas, but now we also have other village ninja, Kages, Tailed Beast hosts, Sasuke’s new Hebi allies, and temporary replacements for Sasuke and Kakashi in Team 7. With so many characters, most of them don’t get enough development to make us care about them beyond their base personality and powers. And sadly, that applies to the villains too. I do appreciate that the Akatsuki serve as Shippuden’s main antagonists. There was strong buildup for who should have been the final villain. But then there’s Kaguya. Without getting into spoilers, the lack of buildup for her is one of the most universally criticized aspects of Shippuden. There’s a bunch of nonsense about fate and reincarnation, and at this point, the ninja world’s reliance on magic becomes obnoxious. But honestly, Kaguya is just a symptom of a larger problem—Shippuden’s escalating power creep, which had been growing worse long before she even appeared. What’s probably the most disappointing for me is how Shippuden handled Team 7—the core reason the time skip even happened. By the end of pre-time skip Naruto, Sasuke’s character was already heading down a dark path. And let’s just say he becomes a lot more unlikable post-time skip. While there are good reasons for his descent, and some of it is due to certain characters withholding information from him, he still comes across as a moody, irrational mess. He constantly shifts his motives, becomes increasingly cruel, and gets way too much forgiveness for the terrible things he does. Then there’s Naruto and Sakura. They make so many dumb choices in their quest to “bring back"" Sasuke. I get that this is the heart of the story, but the way it plays out is exhausting. Watching Naruto and Sakura regress personality-wise just to make this happen was frustrating, and by the end, I didn’t even find their resolution satisfying. Their dynamic, which should have been a highlight of Shippuden, ended up being one of its biggest headaches. I honestly feel bad for Kakashi—he had to deal with a bunch of emotionally unstable teenagers who eventually gained god-like powers and affected the world because of some melodramatic love-friendship nonsense. Shippuden has its moments—a stronger, more somber tone, some cool fights, and a handful of emotional scenes. But the things it focused on just weren’t for me. The bloated cast, the increasingly dull fights, and the Team 7 drama made it a slog. And the slow pacing certainly didn’t help. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but we got what we got.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_23f05a7b9d,18
"Review 20: Naruto Shippuden (Our favourite hero grew up?)??? Well, well, well he's returned to our screens once again. But did he mature??? No Is he smarter??? No Did his brightly coloured strange outfit change at all??? NO Another fun loving Anime program following on from the original Naruto series. We see our favourite hero returning after 2 years training with his sensei. He's still loud and annoying, but for once everyones happy to see the demon child that is Naruto. Unfortunetly for his long time freinds he still poses that pervy, hot naked chick move which still freaks me out on a mild level. Well Sakuras still the same to!!! Apart from the fact she's turned into a mini Tsunade, once again creepy on a mild level. Turns out in the years Naruto was training he became a great healer just like Tsunade.We see in the early episodes of Naruto Shippuden that even Tsunade's training may not be enough for some forms of healing. Her appearence has changed ever so slightly,the clothes follow the same colour scheme and fashion from the previous episodes, but I thought she would start growing her hair again for Sasuke, but it seems the shorter look has stayed and will be there to stay for a while. Apart from this she's literally the same person, a few slight alterations inher wardrobe have not altered the fact that whenever Naruto goes off of task... She's there to hit him. (Obviously)... With enhanced graphics and a slightly older audience to watch this series of Naruto it seems perfectly normal to me to jump straight in like they have. You know, introducing new characters and meeting up with past members of the Naruto series. I have to say, I did start to watch the original Naruto series but became bored as i'd already read it. So I thought to fit back into the crowd I would start watching the series again. Good decsion for once. I do think this series is better than the original. I think the only reason I think its better is because, well they've grown up, so its as if people my age can relate to the characters that we love. It may seem weird but it is true. I know younger kids at my school who prefer the first series to Naruto Shippuden as they can relate to him and the situations he's in. I don't think Naruto's personality has matured or grown up with him. I think its the appearence and the voice that make him seem older. I actually like this element of Naruto as I prefer his characters to be this way, the series wouldn't be the same if he was smart and sophisticated 24/7. I'm glad with te decsion to keep him as a wacky nut job instead of a stuck up tight wod. I prefer the aged Naruto to the younger one who always wanged to become hokage. Therefore I prefer Naruto Shippuden to the original Naruto series. (Sorry to offend anyone)...

"You'll probably read a lot of reviews, good and bad, about Naruto Shippuden. Personally, I was glad that the old Naruto ended and we had a time skip to when they are teenagers (not that I didn't enjoy some aspects of the old one but that's a whole other review). Story: I like that they all have grown up a bit. You can tell some thought has been put into their characters now. Even Sakura (cringe) has developed characteristically some. Naruto isn't *totally* a blubbering idiot. After awhile it just gets annoying to see everyone whining and acting like the elementary kids they are modeled to be. The story has some darkness to it now. The Akatsuki are rampaging across the Ninja Lands. Everyone is forced to fight. I mean, it's becoming a more adult(ish) anime while still preserving funny parts. Of course, we'd love to skip the fillers if we could, but truthfully, a lot of my favorite episodes have been fillers. I think most of them (not all) are beneficial to developing the characters and, let's face it, it's just that many more episodes to look back on after Naruto is over for good. Art: I rated this a 7 because they can really change from awesome to... (well see certain scenes of the Pain arc). It just seems sometimes the ""good"" artists took a sick day or something when some episodes are being done. Sound: I love just about all of the opening and closing songs. They are usually fitting choices with the feel they seem to be going for at the time. Also, their sounds effects are average enough to not seem to noticeably out of place. The songs they use in the episodes are okay, it's just that they've used most of the same ones since the beginning of Naruto and, frankly, I'm getting tired of the recycling. I think the fans are worth looking up a few more pieces of music... Also, sometimes they play their ""epic"" song (I don't know these names I just know that they play this when Naruto starts to get hyped up about something) at random times. It usually causes a good laugh. Character: As I said before, I really like that things seem to be growing up more than before. It's hard to describe without spoilers, but it just seems to mature which is great. Enjoyment: I eagerly sign on every Thursday to check out the newest episode and watch it on the spot whether its a filler or not. I enjoy the show and I'll probably be following to the very end. Overall it's an 8 for me. It would be higher, but for the sheer mass of fillers, random sound issues, and sloppy artwork from time to time. I would like to add one last thing, though: I can deal with the fillers, but the thing that makes me want to punch my computer screen is the flashbacks. Flashbacks every four seconds usually. There was one recent episode (at the Summit) that was one giant flashback recapping ALL of the episodes including the original Naruto. My. God. I understand that we need some from time to time to refresh our memories, but it got to the point that I could start reciting parts of scenes because of the flashbacks. Biggest downside: flashbacks. Anyways, I'd still recommend this anime to anyone who asked. I think it's dumb not to give it a try just because it's popular. It's just as stupid to NOT do something because it's popular than to do it because it is.",8,Recommended,"Sep 22, 2011",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5b10564fb3,18

"Undoubtedly the best shounen anime of all time (maybe bar one piece), and the long running show with the biggest fanbase is just a testament to how popular and good this series is. Naruto was my first anime (not counting pokemon) and still easily my favourite.I started this anime when i was a brat and watched another brat grow to the Hogake he's now. Everythings so awesome about naruto, that its hard to pick something and i have a very personal emotional attachment to naruto. With a vast world filled with jutsus and various techniques with awesome and unique character design for each character, breath taking fights where ur screaming and ur blood's boiling till it bursts, the moments that render u speechless, just the right amount of deaths (not too less or not to overdone like cough 'Akame ga kill'). and Naruto's character development is through the roof. This anime undoubtedly has the best villains overall, and the best villain anyways, with a backstories that make u sympathize with even Pain, who killed literally so many peeps (R.I.P. Pervy sage) and not to mention the most badass character ever, yes who else but the legendary Madara Uchiha. And the Kakashi Vs Obito, Madara Vs Guy, Naruto Vs Sasuke, every fight in Naruto has so much weight behind it, so much emotions behind them. The choreography is god tier. Naruto really set my bar for anime along with my bar for villains. The final showdown btw Naruto and Sasuke was very satisfying and exactly how a final fight's supposed to go down.

Story: 7 Kishimoto has done an amazing job, creating a story while taking enough time to develop characters. The story has its twists and turns and is able to grip you into it. There are a few inconsistency in the timeline, especially Itachi and Kakashi, mostly because these characters were over developed.

"The obvious complaint is probably clear for anyone who has seen the show: filler. Good lord, there is a lot. At first I was fine with it, because it was the first anime I watched, and I watched a lot. Before I found Crunchyroll, I would google _________ vs _________ and watch the fight scenes, which would be 90 minutes long and 20 minutes of actual combat. But again, I was fine with that, even when I started to watch the series in order. Then I branched out to other anime that I saw on tumblr: Attack on Titan, Fairy Tail, and KnK to name a few. I was FLOORED the first time I watched AoT because of how much story they crammed into each episode. One episode of AoT was equal to seven episodes of Naruto. It's not even for story purposes; half of the Naruto filler is people glaring angrily at each other from across the battlefield. Plus, do you really want to watch seven episodes of the main character trying to rip a leaf for training? Another thing that I was not a fan of in Naruto was the amount of dues ex machinima they used during the battles. Just when a character seemed totally screwed, he would suddenly unveil a secret Jutsu that he/she cast twenty minutes before. It was like the writers put themselves in a corner every battle and had to create a miracle to save the plot. The soundtrack is amazing though, and it can give one goosebumps. The art is good, with sweeping landscaped and the collateral damage from the battles would show, which I thought showed a good attention to detail. Some characters you'll hate, others you'll love, and that's a good thing. The character development is nice, although the pacing can be shotty sometimes, and characters may disappear for weeks in-show. While this is a cornerstone in the anime world, and I do enjoy it a lot and would recommend it, I have to say there are substantially better animes out there. One good thing is that this show is not terribly far behind the manga, but that also is the cause of all the filler.

"So this is not going to be a long review. Naruto is one of the most beloved manga, and it is noy hard to understand why. The setting is unique and the characters are very intresting. But in Shippuden all the elements that made part 1 unique are lost after a certain point. The fillers are too many making about 40 % of the series and the final arc is boring and full of plotholes. Now it might have stumbed a bit in the final arc but the ending is where it truly failed. Extremely important plotpoints are left unresolved and brushed aside and the characters lose their essence. It basically feels like you are watching strangers, which can be painful especially if you have come to love the characters and mainly the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki who loses all of the qualities that made him lovable among the audiences.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 21, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2b88acf47c,18
"strong points + best thing about naruto has got to be the characters. naruto, itachi, jiraiya, these are just some of the few examples of profoundly impactful characters that have etched a deep impression onto its viewers and caused viewers to be extremely emotionally attached to them and whatever they may experience throughout the story + although not particularly sophisticated and intellectual to the likes of Death Note and Code Geass, naruto's story and universe in general are still very comprehensive and feel very immersive for the viewer + the use of music is very focused and adds heavily onto the atmosphere as and when appropriate, changing the mood and tone as it goes along. + many of the fight scenes that happen are very well thought out where characters do interesting things to try to outsmart their opponents or work together effectively to form a better strategy, generally applies for most fights weak points - of course the major criticism naruto gets is the insane amount of filler material/flashbacks present (almost 40% of the 500 episodes) and while this definitely prevents naruto from being a straight 9/10 due to the repetitiveness and loss of impact from overusing fillers, there is a filler guide available people use it as necessary - naturally, naruto's art and animations are not particularly the best. some character's faces and fight scenes in general are poorly animated (e.g. naruto vs pain) although generally they are good enough to go buy most of the time. don't expect anything close to violet evergarden or anything like that - naruto's pacing can be questionable at times, although this applies more exclusively for earlier seasons. from less important events being explored heavily to extremely draggy fight scenes, these are some of the issues with pacing. once again however, not a very big issue for the most part of naruto especially if you follow the filler guide at the end of the day, naruto is still one of the best big-ticket mainstream animes out there with a really comprehensive universe and some of the most impactful characters out there.",8,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d4f46c4471,18

Basically, I don't watch anime original episodes (personally, I only watch the past episodes 176-196 and Konoha Hiden from episode 494.) 2. Since the target age is wide, watch at the speed that suits you (I watched it at about 3x speed).",9,Recommended,"Mar 4, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8c5e6558c5,18
"this Verse is threatned the Vengeance of God on the wicked unbelieving Israelites, that were God’s visible People, and lived under Means of Grace; and that, notwithstanding all God’s wonderful Works that he had wrought towards that People, yet remained, as is expressed, ver. 28. void of Counsel, having no Understanding in them; and that, under all the Cultivations of Heaven, brought forth bitter and poisonous Fruit; as in the two Verses next preceeding the Text. The Expression that I have chosen for my Text, Their Foot shall slide in due Time; seems to imply the following Things, relating to the Punishment and Destruction that these wicked Israelites were exposed to. 4 Sinners in the Hands 1. That they were always exposed to Destruction, as one that stands or walks in slippery Places is always exposed to fall. This is implied in the Manner of their Destruction’s coming upon them, being represented by their Foot’s sliding. The same is express’d, Psal. 73. 18. Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction. 2. It implies that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected Destruction. As he that walks in slippery Places is every Moment liable to fall; he can’t foresee one Moment whether he shall stand or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once, without Warning. Which is also expressed in that, Psal. 73. 18, 19. Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction. How are they brought into Desolation as in a Moment? 3. Another Thing implied is that they are liable to fall of themselves, without being thrown down by the Hand of another. As he that stands or walks on slippery Ground, needs nothing but his own Weight to throw him down. 4. That the Reason why they are not fallen already, and don’t fall now, is only that God’s appointed Time is not come. For it is said, that when that due Time, or appointed Time comes, their Foot shall slide. Then they shall be left to fall as they are inclined by their own Weight. God won’t hold them up in these slippery Places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very Instant, they shall fall into Destruction; as he that stands in such slippery declining Ground on the Edge of a Pit that he can’t stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls and is lost. The Observation from the Words that I would now insist upon is this, of an angry G O D. 5 There is nothing that keeps wicked Men at any one Moment, out of Hell, but the meer Pleasure of GOD.",9,Recommended,"Dec 23, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_71cd506d0b,19
"I've finally finished Shippuden. I don't use the word finally to suggest the show was a drag, yes, it had it's up and downs, rather stratospheric up's and mind numbing downs to be frank, but on the whole it was an exciting, riveting, wholesome and heartbreaking experience I am very glad I finally got round to watching. I'm here not really sure what to write. So much has been written about Shippuden that this review won't really add anything to the thousands of reviews that have come before but nevertheless, here we go. I normally break up my reviews into 3 key parts; Story, Animation and music though I'm not sure that would really do this 500 ep show the justice it deserves so I'll separate the story into some of the key character's stories instead. Firstly, Ill cover the animation. Its really hard to say anything bad about the animation here. Naruto doesn't really lend itself to the over the top animated fight sequences compared to other shounen, simply because of how the characters fight and the usage of Ninjutsu. There were many times I was begging for some over the top moments but I can now safely say, when appreciated without my expectations, at worst the animation does exactly what it needs to, at best it's beautiful. Where the animation shines is in the hand to hand combat. I can't name specific fights here as it would have result in spoilers but it is safe to say they are stunning to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are some Ninjutsu based fights that are equally stunning, but I think it's safe to say that the fights in Shippuden have animation take a back seat to narrative, and what a narrative it is, I'll come to that later though. All in all, as I said above, at worst, the animation does exactly what is required of it and I wouldn't want it to change. I don't believe the animation needed to be more intense or mind-blowing, despite it not being either of these two things, I believe it is perfect for the show I would give it a 9/10. Moving on to the music. Personally, it's perfect. 10/10. The choices is music fit literally everything perfectly. Moments of stress building are have their own motif, moments of heartbreak have their own motif, moments of joy have their own motif and moments of saying goodbye the same. In between these recurring themes are subtle background sounds that deliver a true score experience. Some of the key standouts from the music are; Sadness and Sorrow, Martyr, Loneliness and my goodness, Experienced Many Battles borrows to my soul. Ill be honest, Ive named some here, but there are all perfect. I know the show is fresh in my mind, but with every passing second of these songs, I can hear vividly the characters, I can see the moments and if you take a look of the comments on YouTube to any of these songs you will see endless comparable remarks like mine. The music is not only stunning, but it has a way of replaying the moments in your mind with such vivid quality and floods your entire body with the accompanying emotions Shippuden delivers so beautifully. I watched this show when it was long finished, and it already resides within me emotionally, so much so that the smallest note can bring up the wonder of parts of this show. I can only imagine the connection and deep love people who watched this being released must feel for this show. I can imagine the music simultaneously breaks, repairs and embraces their hearts all at the same time. The music of Naruto is phenomenal. If you have finished the show and disagree, go here -https://youtu.be/kgaUXbOdbck?si=2330Rq_kUibM4fSF. I would put money on it that you change your mind very quickly. Its not until you hear the music outside of the show that it really hits you and you truly realise it's a masterpiece of an OST. Now I've got myself all emotional, what better thing is their to talk about next other than the characters and story.....here we go.....One thing this show does unbelievably well is emotion. It is within every single second. Whether that be love, sadness, forgiveness, anger, every emotion is perfectly conveyed. I would also like to point out that everything up to episodes around the 400 mark are 10/10. I found that within the episodes of 400 to 500, it's full of flashbacks, some you have seen multiple times by this point and it really starts to drag a little bit. So with this in mind, Shippuden is not a perfect show, but I would still give it a 9/10. Considering how many episodes there are, this is an incredible feat. Above, is the only real negative thing I have to say about the story really, so with that in mind I want to mention some characters. Jiraiya - for me, Jiraiya is everything to this anime. He is the rock for Naruto, he provides the perfect level of comic relief at time and ultimately in integral to most of the story's progression. Jiraiya plays such a fundamental role to this show that there is very little I can say here without spoiling something. There is so much I would want to say about this guy. One thing I will say is that Jiraiya will give you some of the best character driven arcs of any anime. He is in one of the best of Shippuden (The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant) and is the undying flame behind possibly the greatest story arc ever written (Pain's Assault). Jiraiya is one of my favourite characters in this show and will likely be yours. Itachi - Speaking of the two arcs above, smack bang in the middle of them is Fated Battle Between Brothers. One thing is for certain, I can say absolutely nothing about this. Only that this changes everything. Itachi is such a superb antagonist. His mere appearance causes fear for anyone in his presence. He really is a fascinating character. Sadly however, I can say no more about him specifically. What I can say is there are some truly beautiful moments with Itachi involved and equally moments of excitement. He is involved in one of the greatest fights of the entire show and he deserves it. Sasuke - now, I can't say I have the same fondness for Sasuke as I do for the first two mentioned. I believe that he is a missed opportunity in this show. His character delivers very little for me. The only thing positive Sasuke adds is the fact that Naruto wants to bring him back to the Leaf. That's it for me. Most of the arcs he is part of are either rather boring or his part in the exciting arcs is boring. Also, he's just an unlikely character and I don't think it's down to purposeful writing. Good writing of an unlikely characters makes you enjoy not liking someone. Sasuke for me, is just unlikable and most of the time when he appears on screen, I want it to be over sooner rather than later. Pain - Ok, setting Sasuke to one side who is the only character is don't like, I'll talk about the perfect antagonist that is Pain. There is nothing about pain that is badly written. Every flashback, every line, every movement is perfect and yes, he is the key antagonist in Pain's Assault arc and what an arc it is. Most of you time you are just sat, mouth open in shock, or eyes flooded with tears through sadness or happiness. The characters writing of Pain is the best the show has, and this show has so many great characters I won't talk about. Pain is perfection and truly encapsulates the word itself. Again, I won't go into the content of the arc itself as it is so important not to know a thing going into this show but trust me, Pain and this arc is a masterpiece. Naruto - finally Naruto. Its really hard to put into words the journey this fool takes you on. I have laughed out loud, I have cried out loud, I have been heartbroken, warmed to the soul and been happy to continue with his every step of the way. Most characters develop over time, the character development in the show is superb, Naruto has it all from the beginning. Difference with Naruto is one layer of emotion is shown at certain times and covered back up when required. As far as protagonists go, he's is up their with Luffy. I'm sure there will be some One Piece elitists that disagree but his is and that's the end of it. The twists and turns Naruto has to go through is honestly and incredible ride and he also has the most emotional moments of the show, and they really are emotional. He is superb All in all this show is superb. All in all it's a very strong 9/10 for me. As I said at the top, 9/10 for a show with 500 episodes is quite the achievement. Shippuden is a must watch as far as I am concerned, a show with little flaws and moments that you will remember for the rest of your life.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5c319a5eb7,19
"Naruto Classic is good, and Shippuden starts well and remains acceptable until Pain's arc, after that it's just downhill. from there, Shippuden takes everything that was presented in the classic and throws it in the trash, remember the charismatic characters of the classic? forget everything, what matters here is only Naruto and Sasuke. Remember that Naruto story that ""there is no destiny"" and that ""he makes his own destiny""? Forget it, Naruto is now the child of Ashura's prophecy and reincarnation. The Arc of War is one of the worst things ever done, too much trouble, screen time for characters that didn't matter at all for that part of the story, and LOTS of filler during the war, and if that weren't enough, there are even flashbacks in all episodes, a problem that has been around since classic Naruto. The animation worsens with each episode and the end of the war, come on, the final villain is an ALIENIGINE without any development that emerged FROM NOTHING in history and was defeated by a JUTSU HARÉM. Anyway, very bad, it's just not a complete crap, because it has Pain's arc which is good.

"Naruto Shippuden is one of the most overrated anime I've seen. While it has a massive fanbase and a few unforgettable moments, the overall quality—especially the story—is weak at best. Let’s get this straight: the story is a mess. After the Pain arc and some decent world-building, it completely collapses. The war arc is bloated, filled with recycled flashbacks and dragged-out fights. The final Naruto vs Sasuke fight, which should’ve been the emotional climax of the entire series, felt lazy, forced, and anticlimactic. It had none of the depth it promised. I’d give the story a 1/10—purely because it had potential that it never delivered on. Now about the main character: Naruto himself is one of the most underwhelming protagonists in anime history. His entire character gets reduced to “talk no jutsu” and blind optimism. He rarely shows depth, complexity, or real emotional growth after a certain point. Ironically, his best fight probably isn’t even in this anime—it's in Boruto, where we finally see a more grounded, matured version of him. Despite all that, the character writing isn't completely hopeless. Shikamaru, Itachi, Jiraia and Kakashi are easily some of the best-written characters in anime, period. Their backstories, motivations, and emotional arcs are incredibly well done. Honestly, they carried the show. If the whole anime was written with their level of depth, Naruto Shippuden could’ve been on a completely different level. Animation is hit or miss. Some major fights look amazing, like Pain vs Naruto or Kakashi vs Obito, but outside of those, a lot of the animation looks dated or just plain bad in slower episodes. So I’d give it a 7/10, considering the time it aired. One major issue: filler. There’s way too much. Over 200 episodes of pure filler or poorly timed flashbacks completely ruin the pacing. Nothing kills hype like being thrown into a 5-episode childhood recap during a war. Final thoughts: A few legendary characters and fights aren’t enough to save Naruto Shippuden from weak storytelling, a bland main character, and a pacing disaster. Watch it for the highlights, skip the rest.

"Naruto is for anime what Taylor Swift is for pop music: it divides opinions, definitely overrated in some aspects but it's something you should check if this is your thing. Naruto, despite its plot holes and misconstructed characters, is a story that's both too big to just end but too unique to have a satisfatory sequel. I'll forever keep it in my heart along with the strong feelings I had while watching. You'll watch someone's growth and I'm sure it will inspire you in some way, no matter where you are in life. I say this because I've been a fan for more than a decade and, although the things I like about the series and how I like them have changed, it's still very dear to me. I really reccomend watching it fully. Yes, with the fillers. Some are really boring, I must admit. But most of them show sides of the characters, especially the side ones, you wouldn't see otherwise. Not to mention the comic relief. There's no reason to rush into it so just enjoy it at your pace and I'm sure you'll be touched by this beautiful story. Now, it's definitely a shame that so much happened for this to culminate in Boruto but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",8,Recommended,"Dec 31, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_64a2813880,19
"Wow, what an anime. So happy I watched this as one of my firsts as it has inspired me to watch so much more. It also inspired me to work out and better myself as the main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is an untalented outcast in the hidden leaf. He works harder than anyone and doesn't allow any negative opinions to enter his head. By far, one of the most likeable main characters in fiction as you only want the best for him. Aswell as the mc, the side cast is as much likeable. Shikamaru, kakashi and pervy sage (jiraiya) are incredibly encapturing and Pull you in when they're on screen. The deutaragonist, sasuke uchiha, leaves the village and is definitely one of the best parts of the show. His main goal is to kill his older brother, itachi uchiha, who slaughtered his clan.

"I started watching anime with Naruto. The story itself is very interesting and well made, at first I wasn't that so into it since I saw there were 300+ episodes (although a bunch of them are fillers) but as I started watching I got easily caught up in it. This anime makes you feel compassion, friendship and closure to the characters in it, the animation isn't the best but the series itself is pretty «old» so I think that's normal and not a crucial negative point. Each character has its individual story/development and their importance in the series. For example, one of the best side character of this whole anime is Shikamaru. The way his story was written and incorporated in the anime is amazing, definitely one of my favorites.

"Watching this series, worth watching, liked its minimalistic graphics and action. It has a great story and very unpredictable. I have started playing its game too. You can download it from here https://apkbeyond.com Uniqueness: While Naruto incorporates many elements commonly found in the shonen genre, such as epic battles, character growth, and a coming-of-age story, it also introduces several unique concepts and a vast world filled with ninjas, complex political dynamics, and intricate lore. Naruto's journey from an underdog to a powerful ninja, as well as the exploration of themes like friendship, destiny, and the pursuit of peace, contribute to its distinctiveness. Predictability and enjoyment: While certain aspects of Naruto's plot may be predictable at times, especially in terms of character development and certain story arcs, it remains a highly enjoyable series for many fans. The emotional depth, well-choreographed fights, and compelling character interactions often outweigh any predictability, especially for viewers who are fans of the shonen genre and appreciate the familiar tropes and setups it offers. Art style: Naruto's art style is fitting for the story it tells. The character designs are distinctive, and the action sequences are fluidly animated, showcasing the intensity of the battles. The use of vibrant colors and visually appealing landscapes adds to the overall aesthetic and complements the energetic nature of the series. Well-rounded characters: Naruto features a wide range of characters, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and flaws. The main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is initially portrayed as an impulsive and brash individual, but as the story progresses, he matures and develops into a more thoughtful and empathetic leader. Similarly, other characters undergo significant growth, facing personal challenges and overcoming their flaws, making them relatable and multi-dimensional. Realistic reactions: While Naruto is set in a fictional world, the characters generally react to situations and events in a realistic manner, considering the circumstances they find themselves in. Their emotions, motivations, and actions are often driven by personal experiences, aspirations, and the complex relationships they have with one another. However, it's worth noting that certain exaggerated elements, such as over-the-top battles and supernatural abilities, may deviate from strict realism, which is common in the shonen genre. Enjoyment by others: Naruto has amassed a large and dedicated fanbase worldwide, and many people have found great enjoyment in the series. However, like any form of media, personal preferences can vary, and some individuals may not resonate with Naruto's storytelling or genre conventions. Factors such as personal taste, familiarity with shonen anime, and interest in themes explored in the series, such as friendship and personal growth, can influence whether someone will enjoy or dislike it. Overall, Naruto's blend of compelling characters, emotional storytelling, epic battles, and its exploration of universal themes has garnered widespread acclaim and popularity. While it may not be universally loved by everyone, its appeal to a broad audience suggests that many viewers will find it enjoyable.",9,Recommended,"May 19, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c335c8c7e1,19
"What can one even write in a review for a show where youve watched 700 episodes. No words are enough really. Ofcourse theres also the point its split into two parts. Im just gonna do a small review for each. Naruto : Starts off a little slow. You have to endure the usual goofy Shounen humour. Sillyness. Pacing. Picks up the the Chuunin exam which is maybe the best tournament/exam arc of all time for me. That was the first time i started to feel it with Naruto and im gonna enjoy this long journey. Music is great. Tons of great openings. Some great fights. Rock Lee vs Gaara remains my all time favorite. The show continues to be great with the usual slowdons with some shorter fillers and boring recaps/slow pacing. Only to end with a HUGE filler end which bored me to death and i had to endure to get through and questioning if Naruto is gonna be wirth it. Ruined it a bit why i lowered it to 8/10. Shippuden : This is the big one. Where things finally start to happen. Coming from a long boring filler end i feel Shippuden went straight to the good stuff with Akatsuki and his nine tails origin. Soundtrack gets even better and so does the openings/Endings. Closer and Silhouette two of the best openings there are. The plot, with all its parts about Narutos backstory, the Ninja worlds origin, and all the important characters is incredible. The only letdown is the usual stuff. Some boring Shounen ”humor” Mostly weak female cast. And again way to much fillers. This time its more spread out. But this also means more interruptions. Not the ling boring endurance bit more annoying pace issues/interruptions because of it. Shippuden was the stronger part though since the original OST was greatly expanded and better, openings/endings likewise, plus tge greatly expanded plot and lore about the world and how it all connects and comes together to form an epic ninja tale. Why this part get tge higher 9/10. Overall: An experience and journey that is a must for people interested in the medium. A remarkable achievement despite its small flaws.",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_551c67b78a,19
"Naruto was my first anime, and it’s more than just a show—it’s an emotion. It taught me about pain, friendship, and what it means to keep going even when the world’s against you. The story has classic themes, but it never feels boring because of how deep and personal it gets. The art style fits perfectly with the emotional moments and intense battles. The characters feel real, flawed, stubborn, and full of growth. Naruto inspired me in so many ways, and watching him grow felt like growing with him. And honestly, the villains? Some of the coolest and most badass ever. Pain, Itachi, Madara—they’re not just evil, they’re deep, complex, and unforgettable.

The art stands by personal opinions but i think the art did a prety good job for me as i enjoyed the art i'm gonna give it an 8. Well the sound is on another level, only the songs make you cry, the songs feel alive and they make you fell the character entire story with them a very well maded songs that caracterizize the character well i'll give it an 10 Well the Character are also pretty well designed that have an clear ambition, that they want to get stronger, to protect their friends,but they are pretty bad written characters too, one of the best character developments it s Itachi his story is far on another level, you had to cry at least 1 time when you heard his story.

"anyone would know this anime. This anime already has many fans in the world. the Naruto Shippuden series is a continuation of Little Naruto. Many changes appear in Naruto Shippuden, namely improved graphics, storylines that turn out to be more exciting, new jutsu jutsu that appear, and the appearance of Akatsuki that makes the story more interesting and exciting. In Naruto Shippuden there are also many epic moments and exciting and exciting battles. character building is also getting stronger, especially the main character, Uzumaki Naruto. In this anime, the role of Uchiha Sasuke is also getting cooler and more epic. the added value of Naruto Shippuden is the backsound of each scene is very appropriate to the moment, especially sad scenes, very touching. moreover, plus an exciting fight with a long duration is very interesting to watch. the biggest shortcoming of this anime is too many FILLERS. again the filler problem occurs again in the anime Naruto Shippuden, after the previous series there were also many fillers. many fillers are not important in Naruto Shippuden. but there are also interesting filler episodes that still connect to the main story. I know the filler is made so that the anime is not overtaken by the manga. Now Naruto Shippuden has finished, and filler is not too much of a problem. Naruto Shippuden is finished with the happy ending story. Naruto is married to Hinata, and life becomes peaceful. Naruto is my favorite action anime and will not be replaced by other anime, because this anime has become a legend for me. especially Naruto Shippuden whose storyline changes dramatically, becoming more exciting. I am a big fan of Naruto anime and Naruto Shippuden anime, and also Boruto anime. maybe if Naruto Shippuden has a little filler, then this anime rating will definitely be high, even in my opinion it can be up to 9, because this anime is very popular in the world and has many fans, and has a very exciting story.",9,Recommended,"Aug 3, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_43e4d8ddb3,19
"Disclaimer: My review is purely based on the cannon episodes of Shippuden. I did not watch the filler. Naruto Shippuden is a very emotional character-driven story, and that's why I love it. Sure, it has an out-of-this-world story, with some pretty insane powers (though I do think that this is part of the anime's charm), but it's mainly the characters that carry the show. They are some of the most memorable, well-designed, iconic, and interesting characters in anime history if you ask me. Shippuden is also great from a technical standpoint. My mind is blown at how consistently fantastic, beautiful, and effective the music is. The soundtrack has its own personality, and never fails in setting the mood for any given scene. The OPs and most of the EDs are also pretty unforgettable. While Shippuden certainly has many instances of subpar animation and art, there are also many instances of absolutely phenomenal art and fight choreography that are well worth the wait. My only real issue is with one of the last arcs of the anime. I won't get into spoilers, but I thought it was, hands-down, the worst written cannon arc in all of Shippuden. This fact made the victory of that arc feel less deserved and a little hollow. That being said, the anime does end on a beautiful high note. As a whole, this anime is profoundly memorable. Because of that, I can forgive the aforementioned poorly written arc. This was a wonderful anime, and deciding to watch it from the beginning was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",9,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f1d6c5e87b,19
"If the whole anime was like Pain's arc, it would score 9, but the first arcs are pretty boring to watch and Ninja War is easily one of the worst anime arcs around, and the anime simply abandoned all the good characters from the Classic to focus on the beast drama between Naruto and Sasuke, besides having introduced several interesting characters throughout the plot but that didn't do any good in the end, and even characters that were initially well written like Obito, were spoiled in the end with the classic Discourse no Jutsu. One thing that also bothers me is the fact that they haven't explored almost anything in Naruto's universe apart from Konoha, and even in Konoha some things were left out like that political arc right after Itachi's death.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 12, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9eaa63c000,19
"Extremely stretched without any valid reasons. Let me start with this , Naruto is a extremely good series and a piece of work which will make you fall in in love with this medium (anime) but only if you watch it when you are new to anime , Naruto was my 3rd anime and watching it felt so good that i binged naruto and naruto shippuuden withing 25 days but then slowly slowly i started watching more and more anime and after a certain time when i thought back about naruto i simply started feeling that this is nothing special and is simply overrated (which is pretty understandable) and unnecessarily stretched. There are other shows which people say are copied from naruto like black clover and even jujutsu kaisen but here is the thing, these shows actually did everything right which naruto didnt and they didnt give us 200 fillers neither did they stretched the story for a decade. I did rate the series a long time back and i dont intend to change the score because at that time i actually enjoyed the series a lot but if i have watch it again then i would say i will give it a 6 out of 10. other than that naruto has played a very crucial role in increasing the popularity of anime across the world so it actually do deserve credit for that.",8,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a4c0cf3b52,19
"This is my first time writing a review but i will try my best. Well so first what i wanna say that since everyone tastes are different so some people might not agree with me. But its okay. Naruto is a good anime. Many people hates it and many people loves some people think that this anime is average. But i actually like it. I talk about two things here that's the negatives and the positives and at the end of the review a final verdict for it. First a quick summary. I will try my best not to give any spoilers. [size=90]summary[/size] :- The main character is Naruto Uzumaki. And the story is simple he wants to be the leader of his village means hokage because he wants the villagers to recognise him. Everyone in his village thinks he is a monster and see him as nothing but a brat. Story:- Well Naruto is an overall good anime. For me its one of my top anime i ever watched. It was my first anime too. I already wrote the quick summary of it so you now have a bit of knowledge for it. The best thing i found about Naruto was the enjoyment. The enjoyment it gave me no other anime entertained me that much. It has its own positives and negatives i can't deny that. I found the story of it quite simple but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't say that it has the best storytelling but its still good many other anime does this better. Some people complain about the flashbacks well True but i think flashbacks are necessary here. The story is connected with their flashbacks there are character who has their own tragic backstory and if you want to understand them you have to watch the flashbacks it goes for villains too and why the villains became villain you need to know their backstory and than you will understand the story that's how the story was created theres a villain (antagonist) behind a villain. And that villain is the one who made the other villain a villain well it cofuse right but that's what it is you will know that when you watch the anime. I found almost every flashbacks good my favourite are [spoiler]Itachi's and sasuke's [/spoiler] story. Other flashbacks were also good but i felt a bit bored in [spoiler] obito's[/spoiler] backstory but it was still good because he was one of the villains. You might say what connection does the main story have with flashbacks like i said before if you want to understand the maim Story you need to watch the backstory. Every backstory connects with the main story the same goes for the main character he has a backstory too. Character:- Well characters are not great but still they are good there is a lot of characters but all of them doesn't get enough screen time and one of the main secondary characters is pretty useless and was almost the whole series but became a bit useful at the end of the story the same goes for others all of them has decent character development. But i didn't focus on the secondary characters that much because i didn't think that was necessary if i know the main story and female characters many people says the female character were annoying maybe some of them but i didn't find them annoying or entertaining they just weren't boring. But when it comes to the main characters they were great and entertaining Sounds:- Sounds were decent except for some OST's and OP, ED some of them are my all time favourites. Animation:- The animation was good. I won't say that it was great and top tier. Because Naruto never fucused on animation it was action anime so the fight were absolutely one of the best in all of anime. Positive:- The positives are its fighting. And the overall enjoyment. Its doesn't have the best animation or the best sounds well hear me out first its sounds aren't the best but they great. But it did good at what it should its fighting the fightings are easily top tier nobody can deny. The characters are overall good and i think you will enjoy almost every main secondary characters except one because she was useless almost the entire story. But others are great and their personality too. Negatives:- Well it has a decent amount of negatives too. Its fillers and its flashbacks also the amount of time the other characters get. It has good amount of fillers but if you don't wanna watch it than just skip them if you are like me who only cares about the main story than you can skip it. Now the flashbacks well yeah as i said before you won't quite understand the main story if you skip the flashbacks more importantly the antagonists. Almost every antagonists have their flashbacks and the flashbacks shows why the turned villain. And the flashbacks are connected to the main story. If you skip the flashbacks than at the end of the story you might think why did this villain did this and you might won't understand some of parts of the main story. It has some plot holes too but if i talk about it than i have to give spoilers so that's entirely a different thing. And for the characters just don't care about them. Final Verdict:- After reading all of this you might say that why did i rated it as 10/10. Well true. But that's because enjoyment. I never watched any anime that gave me as much enjoyment as Naruto. I watched Hunter x Hunter and Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. Hunter x Hunter has better power system than Naruto and a better storytelling too. Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood has a better storytelling than naruto. But all of them are nothing compared to Naruto when i think of enjoyments. Maybe im being biased here. Since Naruto was the first anime ever watched so its nostalgic. But im a person who cares about personal enjoyment over anything else. Because of the enjoyment i never noticed all of the other negatives and mistakes. Some people also compare about the fact that sometimes Naruto talks with antagonists, tell them that what they are doing is bad the shouldn't do it and nicknamed this as talk no jutsu. I didn't care about this actually because i don't care about such if it was entertaining 😅. If you are someone like me who only cares about the main story then skip the fillers. Some people might not have same opinions and tastes as mine but that's okay. That was all i had to say. Hope you enjoyed stay frosty. For alternative recommendation:- Watch bleach, Hunter x Hunter. So that was all i had to say guys. It might be a bit big. But i had to make it big to tell you the reason's why i like this show. It was my first review so i hope you enjoyed this.

"this show is just overhyped, it went from talking about ninjas, to talking about how the main character can completely change a character personality just from talking. I still can't find the why to all of the 10/10 reviews when it doesn't even come close to that: the story degenerates and it quickly switches focus on fighting, the art is pretty decent you can't complain much about it, some characters receive less than 15 minutes of screentime and the series itself is 2/3 filler and most of the filler itself is just boring. what can i say, just another overhyped series.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 23, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7471ea406d,19
if only there were less filler episodes it would have been better. The fillers made original story to drag out. I think that Naruto should have spent little more time with his parents. It has one of the most emotional scenes in my opinion which is his goodbye to his father's spirit. Overall it was an enjoyable ang nostalgic anime. Hence they shouldn't have ruined it's legacy by making a crap boruto. a n d n o w i h a v e t o w r i t e t h i s l o n g c a u s e m a l w o u l d n o t a l l o w m e t o p o s t a r e v i e w,9,Recommended,"Jul 29, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_87ad7f305c,19
"This has been a Journey. For everyone who complains about fillers what I suggest is that you watch them and then complain about the series having a lot of fillers because I too complained about fillers at first but most of them were funny af. Still had to say that amount of filler episodes and flashbacks were a lot. Though what I say is give it a try. His journey from a Baka to a less of a baka needs to be experienced XD .The one thing people say like The female characters of this show have been nerfed but I don't think so yeah if a character is weak it is weak it has nothing to do with gender a lot of female characters have been empowered but I do agree but all of them were not used perfectly .I'm sure you'll like Naruto-kun's journey and feel like proud parents whenever he does something great or even cry sometimes.

The best anime after naruto is naruto shippuden. Yes as it tells u about betrayals like who betrayed konohagakure no sato (Hidden leaf village) it also shows about itachi and sasuke(i am not giving spoilers) it gives the secrets as if u know in the prequel naruto and doesn't know his parents. It even shows about gaara and naruto which i like absolutely. So i give it a full 100/100. It even shows things which are nice. The only thing i dont like is why did the makers make naruto almost bald in later episodes he dosent look nice. I would prefer his hairstyle like minato which looks so much nice and if he would get uzumaki strength with namizaki also if would be nice.

"Ignoring the filler and focusing on the main story, it is a pretty decent anime. The writing on the villains was compelling but pretty much every moral struggle that any of them had was exactly the same, the talk no jutsu meme. The characters are generally interesting and likable but non of them have any character development. Most characters are exactly the same when the show ends as when the show starts, just with slightly more context. It quite literally takes to the last canon episode for Sasuke to stop being a douche, which is saying a lot. The fight choreography was really good for important fights but lackluster for anything in between, so good on average. The show for me was a good gateway into anime but after rewatching it recently, I found that it isn't as good as I remembered and is definitely overhyped. I compare it to Star Wars where most of the content is mediocre but it creates a universe and deep lore that is very interesting and worth keeping up with.",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 23, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_bec55e431e,20

"Naruto: Shippuden was a good sequel. It provided something for Naruto fans to look forward to every week for about ten years. By the end, the viewers seemingly parted with their favourites for one last time... and then Boruto was announced almost in the same week. This, once again, was a source of nostalgia for those who grew up with it, and once again, was a complex show with tons of let-downs for many who did not start off their consumption of narrative media with Naruto. The first arc is probably better than the entirety of the prequel series (that's just a joke, it was just better than the mediocrity that so predominantly plagued Naruto). The Akatsuki was finally assembled, the fabled foes were finally pitted against our protagonists. Deidara was one of the most fun characters while he was on screen, as he always had some way to escape the dire situation he was in. Naruto had matured for good, and was much more likeable as a protagonist. The arc was great in almost its entirety, and most of the flaws were not majorly visible. Sai was a great character, and served his purpose as a replacement for Sasuke in the second arc. Naruto's efforts and training were apparently coming to fruition, as they were finally about to meet Sasuke... only for him to overpower Naruto's entire team and leave with the stated intention of never coming back. Hidan and Kakuzu were interesting villains, with both having valid reasons for joining the Akatsuki. Their fights were well-choreographed, and their powers were well explained and well thought out. The whole arc detailing Jiraiya's past with the Third Shinobi War, the search for Itachi on both sides, and the build up toward the introduction of Amegakure, Pain and Konan was astonishing to watch. Each scene of importance felt like a historical retelling, a story from the long gone past. There were many ups, there were rare downs, there were complex characters, and there were heartbreaking events. This, along with Pain's assault on the Hidden Leaf Village, Killer Bee's introduction, and the declaration of war at the Assembly of the Kage, were arguably the best parts of the story. These arcs were where the story and its author, Masashi Kishimoto, were truly allowed to shine, to use characters they had built up, introduce new and interesting characters, and progress the plot properly. Almost every part of the story up until then was great to watch. Then the Fourth Shinobi War started. At the beginning, it was built up as the greatest arc in the series yet. Every action in the preceding 400-something episodes (from both the prequel and Shippuden) had come to some sort of satisfying conclusion in the form of this massive conflict. The war was great to watch from all sides, as it felt like a story that would be told for centuries to come. Everything seemed to be going right : the previous Kage made an appearance, Madara was a great villain, and the true nature of the events up until now was revealed. All seemed to be going well : fillers, while predominant, did not take much from the show in terms of quality, and the story was great, to say the least. And then the show kept on going, stretching the War arc with one twist after another. The first few were anticipated, but as the arc went on, it got much more random. Another flaw the show had was that, even as time evolved, it made barely any effort to evolve its animation and colour pallette till the last arc. Much of it was bland rather than dark, and many scenes were slow in terms of both movement and dialogue. And right in the middle, for no reason, was just a random 7-episode Itachi backstory, adapted from a series of light novels not even written by the original author. Where the show truly lost me, and many other viewers, was the introduction of Kaguya. Her story was sad, but her motivations made no sense, and she seemed to exist purely to conclude the series as a whole. Madara was put out of commission without any warning, and for no reason, and most of the power-ups were done for plot convenience, since the protagonists had had enough of losing. The show managed to somewhat save its plummeting story with the final showdown between Naruto and Sasuke, but the damage had already been done over the course of about 100 episodes. Critiquing the music and art would be meaningless - both were great, just like the previous installment in the series. When the show shined, when it had potential, the viewer could only hope for it to evolve into something generational. While it did in terms of the influence it had, it severely lacked that quality in its narrative. Impactful parts hit as hard as the bad parts disappointed. The sheer length of the show acted as its saviour; everything up until the war's downs (and there was a lot) was great. Naruto: Shippuden was definitely much better than its prequel, had everything going for it for the first 70% of the show, yet when it came to concluding the series, it did anything it could to just reach that point, even if it made no sense.",8,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_bbffb859d6,20

"Story: 9 I really love the story, and -spoiler- the storyline gets exponentially more complicated and I really like that.

If you're a kid, you won't get what happened after the first arc with Sai. Art: 1 It's not exactly the art, it's the animation. It's like they don't care if the animation is any good.

Some of them are anoying, like sakura, but in general it's quite good. Character: 6 I dislike a lot of them. A lot of them are just annoying, like sakura, but there are some characters who are just epic wins! I would like to praise Itachi, Deidara, Jiraiya, Pain, Shikamaru, Hinata and Kiba.

I actually grew up with Naruto. I was around eight and use to wait for him to come on adult swim. Enough corny backstory let`s get into Naruto: Shippuuden. I really like this show. The fact that he was able to beat all odds when the world wanted to see him fail or to become mediocre its a good lesson for people of all ages. Not only that every episode had a lesson attached to it. OK Let`s get into the cons. Those D*MN filler episodes towards the end. I don`t know if he was trying to continue this anime like the infinite tsukuyomi or what. I understand the creators need to stretch out this legendary and famous anime but come on dude. Also the graphic animation of fights of the last few seasons of the anime were a bit ..odd? Like you couldnt see legs or their faces were contorted so weirdly lol. Maybe they were trying to stress the magnitude of power each character held? I don`t know but it was funny looking. The anime finished when both Naruto and I was seventeen and I was in SHAMBLES.

"Oh boy, this is going to be a long one. I put Naruto Shippuden on Hiatus way back when in 2012 or so, when I caught up to the manga. At that time, Bee was first being introduced as a new character. 8 or so years later, I finally, over the stretch of a month, finally finished the entire show. There will be some spoilers in this review. It's been like 7 years since this show has been released, so I highly doubt you haven't watched this show, or plan on doing so anytime soon. In all honesty, Naruto: Shippuuden can be said to contain many flaws, some including ridiculous plot armor, plot holes, and questionable character development. Let's go over them. When talking about the plot in Naruto, one also has to include characters. Characters become a major plot point in many of the most important arcs in Naruto, and so they have to be discussed side by side. And what else but starting with the Main Character himself, Uzumaki Naruto? Naruto can't be considered a terrible shounen main character, and he certainly fills the role quite well. The problem is that much of his character could have been developed in a much greater way than what actually ended up ensuing in his self reflecting and confrontational arcs. His beginning arcs were probably one of the best I've ever seen in a show: gradually transforming from a loner to an identity as a member of team seven. Iruka was the first person to acknowledge Naruto, and this gradual dynamic between Sasuke and Naruto begin to begin. Naruto is able to get acknowledgement and satisfaction from the bonds that he painstakingly forms, and Sasuke doesn't even want to form them in the first place, and thus begins the whole entire setup for their rivalry down the path. However, somewhere along the line, Naruto begins to stagnate as a character. He's extremely immature throughout the entire show, and despite this childish nature, still manages to mature in different ways. This is confusing to say the least. When it comes to his goals, which he eventually finds out with his interactions with Jiraiya and Pain, he's able to easily find his determination and objectives. which of course, can be summed up in: peace. Yet, at the same time, he's idealistic and lacks any sort of concrete plan that allows him to follow up on that objective, and this continues until the very end of the series, where he still has this immature idealistic world view. Neji's death might have been a wake up call for himself, and in some ways, it is. He realizes that in conflict, not everyone can be saved, yet he shouldn't wallow in that despairing emotion, but make sure that the ideals that the person died for wasn't for naught. Perhaps Itachi's talk about how not every burden can be shouldered on his own could also suffice as a rare form of maturing. However, this is where his maturation as a character seems to end, and these moments are few and far between, not to mention, extremely short. There are so many characters and story arcs that focus on Naruto persevering and reinforcing his determination for his goal, but there seems to an extreme lack in any sort of maturing or learning of how he's able to complete such a task. Instead of learning from his own mistakes, he instead gets convenient plot armor in the form of who knows what all scattered throughout the entire series, and this makes him bypass any sort of realization that his actions have consequences. Over and over again, you see Naruto charging into battle, determined to follow through his ideals, and stubborn enough to not ever budge. This is alright, but in the end, he gets beat up, but bailed out by whatever plot devices the author wants to throw at him. Maybe, if someone got extremely hurt, someone died for his mistakes, this would have been a key to his character development. Neji's death occurred in the rare moments that Naruto's actions were completely logical and were not made in a hot blooded attempt to stop the enemy. There is no arc where he undergoes the consequences of his actions, nor is there any arc that helps him understand the reality of his dream. What exactly is it that he can do to make hate disappear from the world? This self searching arc never began. I think it would have been immensely helpful to the depth of Naruto if there was just a single arc where he sees how conflict happens and faces the reality that there isn't just a single ""good"" side and ""bad"" side. Naruto obviously understands this theme very well, but it was always through the flashbacks of other people that he watches as a bystander, and never as a personal experience, and as a result, he never truly matures as a character as intended. The fourth ninja war could have been a great example of this happening, if not for the fact that that entire arc was pretty dumb. It clearly marks the shinobi world as ""the good guys"" and Madara and his gang, ""the bad guys."" Is it really a shinobi war if it's essentially Madara versus the entire world? It's ridiculous how such a great potential arc became a ""good"" vs ""bad"" guy arc. If there was a split in nations supporting and going against Madara, this could not only have been a great way to express how conflict isn't always black and white, but also great fights. Instead, we see lame fights between reanimated people, rather than real ones with real motivations. There is such a distinction that the author wants to make that ""these guys are bad and mind controlled by jutsu"" that it was hard to sit through. In fact, instead of having people side with Madara, in the end, everyone that used to support him goes against him, truly making it so that there is as little need for any distinction between good and bad at all. The entire war arc feels like a ""side character"" arc and doesn't feel like there was any sort of real engagement or conflict of interests in place, since again, everyone on the enemy side was mind controlled or copies of Zetsu. Sasuke, on the other hand, manages to be a much better character in this aspect. Broiled in revenge, he kills his older brother, only to find out the undertones and plots that are hidden in the village. He sets his eyes on the sole reason why Itachi had to kill his own clan: the clan itself. However hot blooded revenge is stopped short by meeting with his brother once again through edo tensei. This arc of revenge to redemption is a clear turning point in Sasuke's character, and is the reason why his goals go from a revenger to a desire to be a savior. This decision to become a savior was also only after he came face to face with the previous hokage, which again, further reinforce the fact that not everything is light and dark. He also cements his perfect idea of what it is to achieve his goal as a savior. What Naruto and Sasuke both have in common are their idealistic hot blooded pursuits in their goals, yet Sasuke manages to comprehend, through his self reflection, on how to achieve his goals, however silly they might have been. And despite the fact that there is such a focus on Naruto's character the entire series, there fails to be any sort of progression as a character in Naruto for the most part, only reinforcing his idealistic dreams, while Sasuke is able to become a more well rounded character with much less screen time and focus. In the end, Naruto's and Sasuke's goals are both idealisitc, but Sasuke matures more as a character, and even determines his next course of action without much difficulty, while Naruto is merely led along the plot of ""defeating the bad guys"" for essentially, the entire series. This does make Naruto progress as a character, but stops short of actually trying to make his abstract goals tangible through his own way of thinking. Plot armor is also a pretty big issue for Naruto, but it is such for all shounen series in general, but the more pressing issue is power progression. Naruto is considered to be a pretty untalented person, yet he still manages to become the strongest shinobi in the world. How did that happen? Power progression in Naruto Shippuuden is one of the most inconsistent things. People get crazy powers throughout the entire show, and not only is this method fast and instantaneous, it also happens so often. There are so many times in the show where a huge fight is tilting greatly in one side's favor, but due to a crazy powerup reversal, the other side has a great advantage. Both the ""good side"" and ""bad side"" do this constantly near the end of the arcs. Not only is this pretty stupid, it doesn't make a lot of sense plot wise. There were many times where some people were so overpowering the other side that the fight was declared over, yet somehow, they don't finish them off and allow them to power up. This power progression is also reserved for a select few, so essentially Sasuke and Naruto become the only relevant characters, power wise at the end of the story. This brings more consequences other than poor plot. It completely destroys and semblance of need for any side characters, and this is my biggest problem with the series. Naruto has one of the best cast of characters in the entire series. Lee, Tenten, Gaara, Neji, Guy, Iruka, Ino, etc etc. There are definitely quite a cast of arcs dedicated to a lot of side characters in Naruto, and it is one of the best points in Naruto. These characters have great personalities and contributed to the plot greatly, earlier in the story, yet fade to obscurity as the story goes on, and when Sasuke and Naruto become overpowering and leave everyone behind to the point where they don't become any sort of meaningful support. Arcs without Naruto in it tend to be pretty damn good. My favorite arc in Shippuuden was definitely Shikamaru and Asuma's arc. The fights were great, Shikamaru's development was great, and the enemy was interesting to watch. In the end, it goes to show that it was definitely possible for there to be a lot more potential arcs concerning the rest of the cast of characters, but it was never explored, but rather just wasted on Naruto. Fights were flashy for sure, but when the same message of ""wow you're just like me, I was lonely and sad too,"" and ""bad guys are bad, I want peace"" gets repeated over and over again, you wonder what could have happened if these characters got more love. Not only are characters shoved aside because power level wise, they were completely obsolete, but it also got rid of any sort of interesting fights involving ninjutsu. Shikamaru's arc, again, is an excellent example of this. His shadow binding jutsu was used in unique and different ways, and so were the enemy's jutsu as well. He couldn't afford to get injured because the enemy was able to reflect injuries right back at you. There was a lot of strategy and matchups that were used, but in later fights, this doesn't happen. It's just more like ""I'm going to bash you in with my OP power, you don't stand a chance,"" and for the most part, this is basically what happens. No unique techniques get introduced, no interesting strategies, but just straight up broken and OP powers get brute forced into defeating the enemy. Elemental weaknesses and strengths essentially don't get mentioned ever again at some point. It really sucks. Power creep in Naruto not only demolish characters, but it also got rid of the interesting ninjutsu's that people were employing in fights. This is most apparent in one single ability: Edo tensei. A completely busted and overpowered ability that has so much impact on the ninja war, yet apparently becomes super weak in the later arcs. What happened to invincibility? What happened to unlimited chakra? Edo tensei manages to become one the most busted jutsu's in the show, but becomes practically useless by the end of it, and it also highlights the lack of consistency. Edo tensei not only becomes obsolete because of power creep, but more importantly, it actually gets weaker for no reason at all. It goes from an invincible form that can't be stopped other than sealing. Regardless of element type, sage chakra, or OP abilities, they will regenerate. Regardless of how much chakra is used, they can regenerate. These features become disabled right after the ninja war arc, and it's never explained. What a bunch of bull. I talk about characters in Naruto as if there were no bad ones. Far from the truth. Sakura and Kuruma are the worst characters, by far, in the series. I always knew the meme about Sakura being useless was a thing, but I thought it was an exaggeration , if anything. It really wasn't. Sakura is a piece of emotional baggage that had literally no influence on the plot other than the fact that Naruto liked her. Liked. her. It was pretty clear that Naruto liked Sakura in the beginning of the series, but as time went on, Naruto accepted that Sakura didn't have the eyes for him, and Naruto even matures so great that he calls her out on his fake confession. This shows how much as a character Naruto grew in this department at the very least. If this were in the beginning, Naruto would have accepted it no doubt. Sakura, on the other hand, can't make up her mind. Time and time again, she can't make her own decisions, and it's clear that her only role in the series is to make us pissed at her. She can't make a decision on Sasuke. Or on killing Obito. or on her resolve to fight. She is such a static character, as she never truly progresses or matures throughout the entire series, and is babied the entire way by all the people around her, especially Naruto. She too, suffers from power creep immensely, and never manages to catch up to, even after her line of ""I've caught up to them, Tsunade"" quote. What a joke. She's unironically also a simp. Loves Sasuke from beginning to the end, despite Sasuke only berating her, trying to kill her, and not making a bond with her to the end. Even after all the crap Sasuke does to her, she is irrevocably in love with him. Holy. Crap. Naruto moves on with his love eventually, yet Sakura manages to never do such a thing. Without reason, no matter what Sasuke does, Sakura loves him anyway. She didn't do a single thing for Sasuke, in the end either. As Sasuke said, the only bond he had was with Naruto, not Sakura. Naruto was his only friend. Naruto is the one that Sasuke acknowledges, not Sakura. Overall, not an impactful character. She hogs a bunch of screentime only because she was on team seven in the past with Naruto and Sasuke. Kuruma's definitely a much better character than Sakura, but he's still a pretty bad one. He just randomly transitions from an amalgamation of evil to ""good guy"" within the span of a few minutes in a single episode. I think we all knew that Naruto was going to bond with Kuruma and that Kuruma was going to eventually befriend Naruto, but what a lame and anticlimatic bonding that was! Sure, there were many arcs regarding the evil nature and uncooperativeness of Kuruma, and the his tug of war with Naruto, but there really wasn't much of a bonding arc, and this was much needed. In the end, he gets defeated by Naruto, and acknowledges him as a result. You might be thinking that Sasuke's bonding with Naruto was essentially the same thing, but Sasuke wasn't actually ""defeated"" by Naruto physically, but philosophically. and this gets explained a lot more. Kuruma's arc felt like subdued=good guy. Not only was it short, it didn't make a lot of sense. That concludes the main points I wanted to share. There was a lot more to cover, but these were the major points that I wanted to cover. Side note: I had the benefit of being able to watch both the anime and read the manga long after the series had ended, and as a result, I was able to navigate any and all fillers by combining my reading through any chapters that were mixed/filler, and skipped all the episodes that were filler. As a result, I had the unadulterated canon viewing experience, and in my opinion, the best way to experience the show. I can't say I would have enjoyed the series as much if I didn't have this opportunity, and can't blame other people for disliking the show because they had to sit through all the filler content. But hear me out. I get it, the filler is bad, but unlike one piece's way of introducing filler, in Naruto, pacing is still alright. There's just filler in the form of entire filler arcs and flashbacks. This can easily be skipped. One piece's filler was ""unskippable."" The show was just at a constant snails pace, which led me to adopt only the manga as a result. Given I could skip the filler, I still rate the anime decently, comparable to the manga.",7,Recommended,"Jan 4, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_dc2fb1fed9,20
"I am completely overwhelmed with the slow pace of this show. This show is not what it used to be back then. The story is definitely good, the art is decent, sound...sure it's good, characters are definitely interesting, but I just cannot enjoy it because it is so slow. The fights are too long. At first it was fine, but it kept on nagging me. I'm just going to drop it.

"To be honest.... this show was actually great... in essence, it could have been one of the most amazing and adventurous shows imaginable, with kick ass fighting scenes and heart felt emotions that are honestly pretty relate able. With its large and expansive world, having its own history to it, it's hard to imagine such a show being fucked up!!!.... Oh wait... -.- Now being serious, Naruto could have honestly been one of the greatest shows imagine able. You have this fleshed out story following this one kid who was looked down upon his entire life, and you see him rise and up and fulfill his dream. What could be bad about that!? That already sounds awesome!! Then you add in some more kick ass characters like Kakashi and fighting scenes and an actual story and a goal and boom!! Sounds good right? R-right....? Now... here's where in my personal taste, this potentially amazing story and show, goes skyrocketing the opposite direction it had the potential to go for. There is, so much, SO, MUCH, POINTLESS, TALKING...... in this show you will catch yourself watching 40% of the last season despite it being the next season and when I say this I mean the FLASHBACKS HOLY SHIT. The fillers in this show are even immense, most of the talking in this show is also very pointless.... and what's worse? The action is crap!! And no, I don't mean the action itself is crap, honestly it was pretty enjoyable, that 1 minute of fighting you saw for every 45 minutes of talking, you get why I think it's crap now? Even IN the middle of some fights when all the action is building up and the drama and intensity is rising, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, has to SOMETHING, that involves that..... or wait, even better... a flashback.... This show honestly had so much potential, it has such a wide spread world that is honestly pretty unique and creative. It has a very fleshed out story, explaining things from the VERY beginning (you rarely if ever see shows doing this) and an amazing adventure following this one admirable kid grow up with great and fleshed out characters near him. The fighting itself is honestly not boring and some of the dialogue is honestly pretty interesting, and heartfelt. But what totally and completely ruins this show for me is the fillers, the constant nonsensical talking, and the CONSTANT FLASHBACKS I CANNOT STRESS THIS, We just got done watching Naruto when he was a kid (first season) and we're onto the second season and you think we need to REWATCH what we already WATCHED!? And that's not including the fillers that INVOLVE flashbacks that have NOTHING to do with the show. Literally the most pointless thing imaginable, imagine it, right now, and Naruto will make a fucking filler out of it somehow. Mind you most of this is the show version, I heard a lot of the fillers and pointless talking is taken out of the manga, but honestly I wish they did a better job with the anime.... the sounds in this show are honestly quite nice and do a good job of impacting the show and making the scenes they provide more vibrant..... With Narutos interesting and unique characters and setting, along with an admirable person following an ambitious dream leading us to various interesting and adventurous tales and awesome fight scenes, this show had so much potential..... I hope in the future they will do a rework on this could be great show.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 25, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_52d74d4894,20
"This is so much better than Naruto guys. This is a whole other level than that and it deserves your time. Here's why: Story: 10 This show doesn't have an over arching goal like many anime do (Hunter x Hunter 2011 or One piece for example) but it just a story of a boy growing up and maturing into one of the finest shinobi and coming into contact with the problems of the world he lives in. He meets people and gets help and guidance along the way while becoming more and more reliable and powerful. It really is awesome. Art: 9 I love the art and the theme it gives the show is great. The only reason this isnt a 9 is it can get sloppy at times, especially during fights which really angers me at times but usually it is great. Sound: 9 Though sometimes is can be a bit cheesy I absolutely love the soundtrack of this show as well as the original Naruto soundtrack. Character:10 Some of the strongest parts of the show are seeing the connections Naruto creates with others and seeing his relationship build with the people closest to him. You really really feel his development as a leader, fighter, and thinker in this show and are cheering for him every step of the way. He isn't a spazzy annoying kid anymore and you really see that. Progression of characters is show as the theme of generations is really stressed and the youth inherit the world from the old and children become their parents etc. It is a fantastic theme. Enjoyment: 9 The fights in this show are awesome and the new powers and villains are some of the best parts of this show. My single character villain ever is in this show. Guess who it is I bet it won't be that hard haha. This show makes you run in circles going ""DAMNNNNN"" and also can make you tear up a bit and make sure no one sees. Overall:9 It isn't a masterpiece, but it is damn close and by no means a waste of time for anyone. Go watch this show. Especially if you have scene Naruto and think their world of jutsu is interesting then this will be a great use of your time. I watched it twice already and it was just as good the second time (skip the fillers though honestly).",9,Recommended,"Jul 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0044173170,20
"Naruto Shippuden is 60% filler episodes and 40% story Story: This is your basic gotta get to the next power level to beat Cell kind of story. they do try to throw in some emotional stuff but it falls very flat and the ending ends just how you expect it. The story is so attached to the main group of side characters the only 3 out of over 20+ actually die. Art: Even though the anime ran from 07' to 17' the art style more or less stayed in the 07' era thus the later animation is average quality Sound: Many Many theme songs for some one or two might be decent enough. However the Main characters voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The same song is used repeatedly(for dramatic effect) in many of the episodes thus nullifying any impact it once had. Characters: The One place where this anime shines and the reason this anime has the most fanfics of any anime. Let me be clear, Naruto the main character has a terrible voice, is pretty annoying and has a extremely ridiculous obsession with Sasuke. I hate Naruto, but There are so many other decently fleshed out characters you will find a few that you may like and most of these character get an episode or two where they are the main focus. Enjoyment: The fact that every episode has a flashback of a previous episode or flash back of a flashback that we have already seen (which sometime take up more then half the episodes runtime) makes this anime extremely annoying to watch and has gained the nickname FlashBack Simulator. Then smack dab in the middle of a main story arc they put in filler arcs just to extend the series length and making so you have to burn through an arc that has nothing to do with the main story to get back to the main story. Even then some episode are nothing but slow talking with long pauses and by the time the episode ends not a lot has actually happened. Some fights are really really good while others they just stand there and talk a lot. Overall: If You have LOTS of spare time and liked the original series you may like this or you could skip to the last 10 or so episodes and be like ok this is them 2-6 years later the end.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 21, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e233af45ca,20
"Story: The story of Naruto Shippuden is about Naruto Uzumaki he is one of the 9 jinchuriki. Naruto came back to the Leaf Villiage and god knows where he was. And this continues with Naruto continuing going after Sasuke Uchiha, his best friend. It's a nice story to be honest. Art: The art in Naruto Shippuden is the same as the original just a bit upgraded. It's art is very good, compared to most anime I've seen. Sound: The sound is great it's the same as the original Naruto, so there's not that much to it. Character: The character in Naruto is good, it's just the development, it's so slow, and you hardly see any development after any battles. Only with Naruto, you hardly see any other characters develop. Enjoyment: I've enjoyed the series a lot, Naruto is one of my first animes I've ever watched it's a good anime, and it has a great story, very good art, and great sound. Overall: I rate Naruto Shippuden an 8/10. The sequel to this series great, the art and sound are great, same with the story. It's just the character that stops this anime from getting a 9/10. I wish we get to see other characters learn new jutsus, this series is very good overall.

Even though I marked some things as outstanding... I have to say that I think the writer and anime producers of this anime need to stop focusing so much on developing Sasuke. I'd like to see more of what Naruto can do then see Sasuke completely be the main focus when the anime and manga is called Naruto...I dislike it when writers focus more on one character instead of focusing on the whole reason they wrote the series called NARUTO.,10,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d0e159d29,20

"Before I begin, I notice this anime is one of those ""love or hate"" animes. There's some people who say it's the shettiest anime ever, and some who say that it's the best anime ever. The people who claim it's the best anime ever should watch some more anime and THEN re-rate, and the people who claim it's the shettiest anime ever... are just following the crowd because people like to bash on the popular anime. This anime is seriously NOT OVER-rated given how many people hate this anime, and it's also not UNDER-rated given how many people love this anime. Done with my rant xD Story - 7/10 It goes by arcs and the story isn't confusing (if you watched from the beginning) and several arcs are really sad and the plot was interesting to watch. However, I feel like it's dragging on and on, and the comedy scenes aren't as funny as the first Naruto. Another thing is the ""I will bring back Sasuke! Believe it!"" and ""He's a precious friend!"" is overused too much. Is Sasuke the only thing Naruto thinks about? (Then comes the SasuNaru fans, myself included) I don't get how a traitor who betrayed his friends and village due to jealousy and vengeance is still a friend, but if Naruto thinks that, then it's fine I guess. Art - 9/10 Clean and easy on the eye, nothing too special, but the art is pretty nice. Sound - 10/10 Character - 7/10 The characters each have their own personalities, and I don't see much Mary/Gary stus.... except for Naruto himself. Not only can he train faster than anyone else (like when getting the rasengan and sage mode), he can also persuade a godly powerful dude (Pein). Naruto, in the beginning was a knucklehead ninja that everyone hates, but toward the end, he became less of a knucklehead and people began to acknowledge him, which was good character developement. Something about the characters annoy me, and that is how SO MANY characters have a emo sob story behind them. Enjoyment - 9/10 I enjoyed it. Overall - 7/10 The ""motto"" is like ""If you work your butt off and have the will to do something, you will succeed"" which is obviously not true. I also dislike the fact how Naruto often touches his tummy and go like 'Oh the nine tailed fox is inside me"" It just looks wrong... and sounds wrong... I can imagine Naruto giving birth to the Nine tailed fox lol.... Another thing I'd like to say has nothing to do with the review, but if the whole village treated me like shot shet and a jealous friend betrayed me, I wouldn't just put up with it... I'd probably bomb dat stupid village and give the friend a serious beating...",7,Recommended,"Dec 2, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c5df82833a,20
"Oh dear, where do I begin? Okay, the first few arcs weren't too bad. We have a few decent storyarcs with a few alright filler arcs in between, that don't actually seem like fillers. Well, they kinda do, but they have their own intriguing stories. In the Wikia, it now splits some of the arcs so those unfamiliar to the listing (e.g. 'Itachi Pursuit' once featured the hunt for Itachi as well as stories revolving around him and Jiraiya's battle) will be confused (like I was just now!). Even the back-story featuring Jiraiya, and the Kakashi Gaiden adaptation was amazing to watch. Like Part 1, Shippuden features updated art, but it is still ugly in areas (have you seen the background ninja - who drew them?). The sound is pretty much the only thing that's going for the anime at the moment. The emotional openings and endings are still something I'm interested in. I know this is entirely to do with Kishimoto, but at least give Ten Ten some non-filler character development! She's worse than Sakura! Ten Ten only has development in the filler. The worst thing about the anime is the fillers. Yes, I said it. The fillers since the War arcs have all flashed back from before the War, and currently do not serve a purpose within the anime. At the end of 2015, there are only eight canon episodes. Where one of the main conclusions of the manga feature, instead there is no end of fillers - and as far as we can tell, none in January either - I'm looking at animefillerlist.com at the moment. Do yourselves a favour and read the manga if you haven't. It's not much better, though. If Naruto had an entire reboot away from Studio Pierrot, the fillers should be rewritten and classified as 'canon', and then the fillers are in their original places (so that they follow along in chronological order as to not confuse fans and keep the dynamic of the War arcs going).",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 28, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1e03536daf,20

"It's way too old....back when I was in school watching some random Anime, I was told by my friend that a new Anime named Naruto is going to start soon in CN. That's when everything was changed....!! I have seen the first episode, to me it was amazing. It captivated me completely. That Anime had made a great impact on my life. I've learned so many things from that Anime. High in morals, it changed my way of thinking. I'm here to write a review on Naruto Shippuden which is a part of Naruto's world. To all Naruto/Naruto Shippuden Haters who think that Naruto isn't the best anime.....I disagree with you...coz is not only the best it's greatest of all time. And one more thing, Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is not for immatures and those who run out of patience very quickly. I consider it as Masterpiece. I do hate fillers...but I like them as well because even fillers in Naruto/Naruto Shippuden has something to do with the morals and the way of living. We all know that story revolves around a knucklehead Ninja who wants everyone to acknowledge him. With help his friends he was able to finally achieve it. There are so many reasons why I like this Anime....they are: 1. Great Story(High in Morals) 2. Deep Characterization(every character in this Anime teaches some good to us, you will get attached to them) 3. Evolution(yes evolution in everything - in the story, in characters, in fights, in techniques), I like new things...! 4. Emotions, Relationships 5. Side Stories(yes side stories of other characters - they are really cool) 6. Memorable heroes and villains(yes though we have one main protagonist we have several side heroes and villains with their awesome stories) 7. Logic(logic in every Jutsu development, in every fight) I've seen Anime with higher ratings but no logic in their battles, training.(IDK why people like something which doesn't support logic) 8. Explanation - everything is explained in detail. 9. Life Lessons - yeah I have learned so many things from this Anime characters. Almost all characters are my favorite but the special ones are Itachi, Naruto, Nagato(Pain), Shisui, Orochimaru, Madara, All Hokages, I will never forget Akatsuki....they are amazing..!! My most favorite episode is a filler....yes it's a filler, a filler in which writer expressed his views about the real world, real people, what it is to create and what it is to destroy, what is life, what is love, what is power? what we can do with our life and how we can be helpful to others!! So many things were just taught just in a single episode. The name of that episode is Ninja Creed. There are so many things that I wanted to explain here but people will get bored of my review so I'm ending this here.

"Ok First off I've been watching the Naruto series since {May 2016} at first i was not going to write a review, After reading some reviews i felt obligated to put my 2 cents.. This review will be very biased in, my opinion but i dont care. Story 7 ~ We have two main protagonist (Naruto & Sauske) That are seen through the entire series and we also can also add in saukura as well as the rest of the supporting characters that get little to no screen time. If you watch the anime fully and completely then you can follow suit with the story/ plot there are misinterpretations in the story plot altogether. It infuriates me and ill tell you why most of this anime is made up of fillers, not that i find fillers important but its more so a drag you have people that were dead showing up in flashbacks, the fillers are ok i can at least say that honestly they do develop and cover more so of the time when all the shonobi were young and other crucial points in the plot... I just hate when good parts for example naruto v. pain there was like a ton of fillers i was at the edge of my seat only to be disappointed. Art 5 ~ What happened!!!! the art is terrible why did they get lazy tho???... the art is very flat you have stiff characters i wasn't really paying attention but when i actually did they looked like sticks talking, they got the characters flying in the air???.. moving forward i can say that i do like some of the sunsets that were really pretty and seemed some what realistic and some fights that really looked good and was vibrant overall they could have did better they got lazy and thats just that. Sound 8 ~ Personally i love the sound some of the soundtracks like ""closer, diver, and yellow moon that i was able to find on itunes and now i listen to them daily... some of the music is ok but i still listen thoroughly (so i can grab food so i can watch the next episode) lol Character 6 ~ Ok in naruto shippuden theirs really nothing fun and giddy about it i must admit when i watched naruto i found it very annoying and extremely whinny but i continued watching it and it was very rewarding as i continued to go along with the story, naruto is not his same self there is really no humor in the series everyone is serious only sai giving us a laugh with his straight forward responses but there is little to know character development i just seen neji after 8-9 episodes like where are the characters that we all love and adore overall everyone grew up the same only thing i would say thats different is there attire. I wouldnt be surprised if urochimaru can back to life... moving on. Enjoyment 7.5 ~ 8 : ok i wouldnt say that naruto shippuden is trash i did enjoy the breath taking fight scense that had me rewinding every 5 seconds even the waste land of of fillers that seemed annyoing or even the determination that naruto has to save his friend.. they could have just took more time to strategically contrast the art the characters being stiff and character have slits as a mouth... ( naruto passing out after sauske attacked the sumit had me in tears) overall 8 ~ overall this is a good anime but i wouldn't recommend it if your constantly busy with work or school or etc. its very time consuming and if you dont have that much free time then this is not a good anime for you to try and be watching, you can watch a few episodes but the story plot takes so long to build everything started popping off at the chuin exams but dont expect for this show to have fight scenes every episodes overall if you have enough time to sit and watch this anime go for it.",8,Recommended,"Nov 29, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_af431dc346,20
"Naruto as a series, is an incredibly complicated masterpiece. Assuming the person reading this has first finished the original Naruto series of our blond haired hero in his trademark Orange tracksuit, I will give a quick summary of some of the critiques I have of this series and what to look forward to in this next amazing sequel. First of all, the soundtrack remains iconic and amazing. The openings remain catchy and the soundtrack is both epic and marvelous. It tends to move away from the very fast-paced Japanese sounding instrumentals of the first series and enters into hymn and choir territory, especially with relevance to characters of God-like status relating to the plotline. Naruto shippuden is a very lore based series, and relates more towards philosophy and morality then the first series ever did. The battles are long, the speeches are longer. I assume Creator Kishimoto wanted his viewers to age up with the anime, beginning to question things they never did as a child. Therefore, expect the anime to become very complex and confusing at some points. Unfortunately, The loveable Konoha side characters that we independently learned and watched fight in the Chuunin exams and Sasuke retrieval Arc have a lesser role in the sequel. New characters and plot lines are introduced and many shinobis are cast to the side lines. The sequel is very much about focusing Sasuke and Naruto's bond and Naruto's own personal character development.. I would argue that the young shinobis still have much relevance, but less screen time in the main storyline as it progresses. The meme of 'NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARUTOOOOOOO' and 'SASUUUUUUUUUUKEH' is pretty much relevant to the series as Naruto fights further to bring Sasuke back to the village. ^_^ The new characters, especially the Akatsuki characters throughout the story, are super interesting and unique, so look out for them. They are all powerful individual shinobi with incredibly unique designs and jutsus. I found them to be the most enjoyable of the series and I hope the reader does too! Naruto Shippuden may not have the carefree, often comedic, nostalgic attitude of the first series main storyline, but it still provides a much enjoyable series and definitely a fantastic must see sequel to the first series to finally get a sense of closure. I have repeatedly stated the 'main storyline' through out this review, because if you thought the fillers of the first series was bad after the Sasuke retrieval arc...then I have news for you. There is a lot of filler. If you only care about the story and not the alternative universes or random plot lines, you may want to stick to the main story line and skip the filler episodes, however some of the fillers I'd suggest keeping a look out for - especially the alternative universe ones, as they give an interesting opposite perspective to the main canon universe. Just try not to get jealous if the alternative universe seems more...idealic then the real world, blood thirsty shinobi world..that was my trap of watching them! I wanted things to be different! ^_^'' I hope you enjoy Naruto as much as the rest of us do, and watch our snarky, smart-mouthed Kyuubi protagonist manifest and develop into an amazing, strong-willed character with all his comrades behind him as he fights for what he believes to be right and true.

"Story 8/10 - As many have already pointed out, the sheer amount of fillers and flashbacks, boy! They're unbearable. But thanks to fan-made Naruto Kai, pacing should no longer be an issue now. Still, can't afford tens of hours? Watch the entire show at 1.7x speed then! If you're a native Japanese speaker like me, you should have no problem keeping up. Some of the arcs like Pain's arc had a deep & profound philosophical theme and I loved it. Had it not for the pacing, I would've given 10/10, but alas. ________ Art 6/10 - I had to drop the show for 2 years because of the art-style. The change from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden certainly requires a bit of getting used to. Picking it back up after two years, everything looked so much better for some reason. But still, it's by no means perfect or even good. The animation on the other hand was outstanding, especially battle scenes. ________ Sound 10/10 - To be honest I didn't care about the OPs & EDs. But that's just because I'm not into Jpop (atm). They're by no means bad, though. The voice actings were superb. The casts were amazing. LOVED the background music! - 10/10 ________ Character 10/10 - Masashi Kishimoto is a genius at making characters loveable. Gotta love the easy to remember simple character names & their unique quirks. Most characters had a pure heart, and that's what drew me in. - 10/10 ________ Enjoyment 10/10 - As I said, watch the Kai version at 1.7x speed and you'll enjoy every minute of it! ________ Overall 10/10 - I always preferred One Piece over Naruto, I even fought my college friends over it, but after finishing the series today, well what can I say, I've finally experienced the change of heart.

"QUICK REVIEW, MINOR SPOILERS. so.. I finally watched Naruto, dubbed as one of the three great big shounen, and I have so many mixed feelings about it.. so let's start! Story 7/10: the story... was not one of its strongest points. It's good, but does it drag on unnecessarily with plot Twists that make no sense at times? 100%. A prime example of this is orochimaru switching sides randomly and with no real explanation other than 'the wind'. This is a character who's literally committed genocide. That said, I do think the mangaka does an insanely well done job with highlighting certain themes from beginning to end, such as perseverance and friendship. The repetitiveness of the constant love/hate between sasuke/naruto, the idea of the 3 in a team representing history & idea of hate and love itself throughout history is what truly brought forward emotions for myself and really carried the plot. That said, pain arc was a masterpiece, and all the other arcs in shippuden pale in comparison. Furthermore, it concluded the huge series really nicely with the wedding... makes me wonder if boruto was needed... Art 4/10: disgusting, and the reason is in this section im including the outright bad fillers and flashbacks. Okay some fillers mightve been good , but when you're in the middle of a war and suddenly have a filler of happy konohamaru..no, just no. People use the excuse of 'were binge watching it now but at the time fillers were good' - let me tell you, no they weren't. Why? Because one piece has less fillers than naruto, running since 1997+ and being double the length . There's other ways to go around lengthening/ delaying the show, and having 20 episode arc long fillers in the middle of scene is a no no. And the flashbacks... you get flashbacks from the episode before. I truly wonder how much better naruto would've been without the fillers and unnecessary flashbacks. Sound 9/10: beautiful, the themes that play during a certain group, truly resonates their character. Openings and endings were solid. No complaints at all. Character 10/10: This is what carried the show. This. When you talk to someone about naruto, they don't say I wanna be naruto, the say I wanna be madara, or itachi or daedara. The villains were so well designed and have so much personality it truly is what made naruto into a masterpiece in my opinion. Naruto didn't carry the show, the villains did. The character development was top notch, seeing narutos growth throughout the entire anime was really solid to watch as well, same with sasuke. Even sakura to a certain extent. Also special shootout to kakashi, easily one of the most liked characters in the entire show, tbh all the characters were above average with design. Then there's the most significant characters, naruto and sasuke. The love/hate between them is so beautiful and eloquent, that it draws out a multitude of emotions from the watcher, who's awaiting them to meet. I've never seen such love portrayed as the way naruto did for sasuke in any anime really. Enjoyment 8/10: Naruto is truly unique. It's an anime I can see why so many people admire it. But let's be honest here, if the villains weren't as cool as they are , I don't think it would've been a show to remember.",7,Recommended,"Oct 26, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db1c8f4912,21
"Okay this is going to be long so please bear with me. Prior to me many have written reviews on this so, you may not find many new points. So I will not write about separately about story, art etc instead I will try to provide my view objectively. Now coming to Naruto Shippuden, I believe it has received so much positivity majorly due to its nostalgia factor. It may not be as bad as I make it to be for some people but let me explain you in detail. First let us discuss the main protagonists of the show: The main problem I had with this is the main trio. We can simply state them in three words ie, dumb,dumber,dumbest. Yes, they are so dumb. Naruto, the protagonist of the series never ever grows up. He is same as he was in Naruto(prequel) except for a few changes. And the people who used to dislike him come to like him for his same dumb antics. Even the characters who had rarely interacted with him believe in him and give *If its Naruto then it can be possible* vibes. They are the same people who hated him before. The dumber part of the show goes to sakura. She is there to make us believe that she is equally strong and determined in the team #7. Her love(only if you can call it that) towards Sasuke is so unreasonable and forced. She is so clingy and is there just to make life of naruto difficult. She, like naruto never stops the ""sasuke sasuke"" thing which is annoying as hell. Kishimoto tries so hard to make us think she has become better. She has always been useless, only occasionally used to make us believe even she is strong. At other parts of the show ahe is just there to occupy space. Now comes the dumbest part of the show. Yes, you guessed it right. It is none other than Sasuke. He is one of the main characters of the show but is absent for nearly half of the show. He gets ready to follow some stranger for the sake of power and ends up abandoning his comrades. To speak it was due to his jealousy towards naruto that made him to become strong. His motives are so messed up and they fluctuate tad bit too much to sympathize for his losses. Even till the end he is as hopeless as a person can get. I am trying to not spoil much but his sense of thinking is so messed up in the later part of the series. This is not all, our main protagonist is so righteous that he goes on and on about friendship that he ends up putting all of his friends into risk in order to save one selfish, arrogant idiot. He gives so lengthy speeches to the antagonists that it makes me sick. He never stops ranting. He is just too loud and annoying for a protagonist. His attitude isn't any better as he does some pretty nonsensical shit during missions that would definitely make you question his maturity even after these many years. Yes, 2 years later, Naruto became 15 years old, and his personality is still the same. He is still unable to refrain from himself from doing something stupid that would fuck up his whole team. What irritates me are the techniques. For some reason, everything is an upgraded version of his previous techniques; Rasengan to Odama Rasengan to Rasenshuriken. 5 Clones to 100 Clones, then went to 1000 Clones. Flashbacks are normal in many animes. However, Naruto is an exemption. The flashback last so long and most of the scenes are being repeated. Flashbacks in Naruto do not bear much significance in the story and yet I do not see the reason in dragging the flashbacks. The fight scenes in this show are all talk and no battle. The fight scenes bores me to death. Fight scenes are very predictable. All characters spend most of their time just standing an telling lame stories rather than fighting. This is how the fights go- Naruto uses Kagebunshin. The enemy beats all of them, beats Naruto to pulp, then Naruto teaches the enemy about life and friendship and at last Naruto hits the enemy with a rasengan and the fight ends. The backstories every antagonist is almost the same. Almost all were good but a single situation fucked up their lives and they end up on the bad side. This is not to say that there are no good characters. They are there but they take the back seat in the show. It took Naruto heck lot of episodes to just get a single power up. There is nothing wrong with it but in the final few arcs he literally becomes god which makes all his hard work seem pointless. The final arcs: Ah! These are the worst part of the the show. It involves the great shinobi war which is dragged to death. It is very poorly written and the antagonist at the end of the show makes this show a joke. There is no build up for it. Yes it is the kaguya part. The war part almost makes naruto and his precious friend sasuke gods. They become gods to defeat gods and naruto is now even capable of healing. The final arcs make all the established rules and world building look stupid. Logic goes for a toss in most parts. The good parts like a few arcs and characters are highly overshadowed by the terrible pacing, whole lot of filler and dumb main trio. The pacing is so terrible that there are so many pauses and others efforts put in to drag the show which make me feel nothing even after a bunch of episodes, as they cover very little progression. Don't even get me started on fillers. They just dragged the anime to make some 700 episodes which is not very enjoyable. Finally there are good aspects which others mentioned so I chose not to as I feel they are so overshadowed by the fillers, pacing and the terrible main cast. I don't know how many people liked naruto but to me he seems too dumb and immature. So I mainly believe that this show rides on nostalgic factor. It has many notable inspirations taken from famous shonen series like HunterxHunter and Dragon Ball. In the end all I want to say that there are better shonen series like HunterxHunter and it is not worth the time you put into this series. Believe me when I say you won't miss a single part of story even if you watch it in 2x speed. By the way this is my first anime review. Anyway it doesn't really matter as I have rather made this review pretty late I guess. I beg your pardon for any grammatical mistakes. Thank you for your patience.

"Shippuuden (non filler) Story 9: pretty solid story I'd say but didn't get the end goal. Naruto did not become hakage(training to be one). Great story of friendships and working as a team. Growing together. Art 9: great art during fights, some of the animation is not the best in the background (character wise) never the least animation is great for it's time. Sound 8: few OP stuck with me, none of the ED stuck with me. Dub cast was on point too, I liked that some of the characters had different VA as time went on since they were getting older. Character 8: great character development, almost all characters from Naruto played a big role in Shippuuden. I didn't end up liking Sasuke(I really don't see why people like him). If itachi didn't exist Sasuke would of been the worse character IMO. Enjoyment 9: honestly fights scenes are incredible and the characters you meet you will fall in love with.

"Naruto Shippuuden is a very well known mainstream fan favourite and continuation to Naruto with 185 filler episodes which aren't bad but y'know they're fillers and do what fillers do. The entire show is very entertaining including alot of the fillers giving you alot of time to have a connection to alot of the main characters, the story has alot of depth with what happens and what each character goes through with actual development so It's not just Naruto who develops. The show also wraps up very nicely although being a show with so many episodes you'll never have the perfect ending which is what Boruto is for. If you still haven't watched Naruto and are just looking at reviews for if you want to watch it or not I'd say it's a great mainstream anime to watch even with how many episodes it has which can look daunting but with the story it gives you it's definitely worth it.",10,Recommended,"Jun 21, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_52854daae8,21
"One of the most popular animes of all time.. Writing seems to have gotten better than its original series. The episodes where they showcase the past were probably the best episodes in the whole series other than the fights. The story was good but had bad pacing at times especially during the fights, some flaws, and also the sub par stories of some of the episodes because almost half of them were fillers. Character development was good also. The characters were alright, there are very few that are likable or interesting. Some of the openings and endings of this anime are legendary and are definitely in the anime hall of fame. The music was amazing. Animation looked pretty good but quite inconsistent at times. It had a similar vibe to the previous series. Overall it was an enjoyable series, it was well rounded and the only thing that really sticked out was the lore and history of this fictional world.

"Naruto fans need to calm down. This show needs 80 episodes MAXIMUM. The long awaited ending was completely BAD. If you have time to watch this UNNECESSARY LONG SHOW, skip the fillers and most episodes and you will still feel bored a bit. Every 50-100 episodes you will feel some kind of excitement, and then, LOOK AT THAT, MORE FILLERS. I was completely hyped for this show, myself and from other people, and I expected so much from it, but it is a really poor and long show all in all. Tastes are different, but there is no need to waste time on such an anime (where most episodes aren't even connected to the manga itself).",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_16630bad88,21
"First off, I just need to put it out there; I have watched over 300+ plus animes and I can gladly hit my chest and boast about the fact that this masterpiece — Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is my favorite anime ever. It would forever hold a special place in my heart. I would be honest, you might be put off by the ridiculous amounts of fillers which are overwhelming sometimes, but believe me, these same fillers help lighten up the dark theme of the series itself. The fillers are by all means evitable. And while some see these fillers as obsolete, I see them as a funny sitcom which does crank me up. Plot wise/story, Naruto isn't perfect, nothing is perfect. It does have some major plot-holes that I believe can be easily overlooked. The story revolves around a young boy named Naruto, he grew up as an orphan, completely neglected by the village all because he has a demonic (Kurama) fox in him. This is the story of an orphan who by all means wanted to he acknowledged, an orphan who wanted to be loved. All Naruto wanted was a family. A family! All Naruto wanted was to be the hokage so as to protect the village and everyone he loved. Without any context to the filler episodes, Naruto as a whole is one of (if not) the best anime out there. It was a good pacing, very gripping plot, some of the best arcs (I found none of the arc boring; some of my favorites from Shippuden are the pain invasion arc, forth great ninja war arc, and the pursuit of itachi arc, just to mention a few.) fleshed out characters, one of the most iconic villains, interesting characters, probably the best fight scenes I've seen in anime, everything, just name it, Naruto has them all.

"NARUTO SHIPPUDEN is the real deal but it also has its negative points. For example: too many filler episodes(almost 50 percent of anime is made by filler and most of the filler episodes ain,t worth watching at all. Its just waste your life time.) The anime is about the ninja world but its just showing too much hand sighs and trainings and it lacks some great fight scenes. just like season one, there are too many filler characters with a nonesence backstory that really means nothing. It could have so many great fights in it but naruto,s goddamn Talk no jutsu killed the mood. So many great & important characters got killed by kishimoto,s hands just to make naruto & sasuke the only reason to watch the anime or read the manga. There are too many useless characters like Rock Lee,Sai or choji. naruto & sasuke are just two ordinary shinobies that could defeat the gods with the power of friendship(NAKAMA POWER) and its really meaningless. Defeating the immortal & highly trained Gods with only NAKAMA POWER? Give me a break. and also, the plot armor is much more than it should be on my opinion: READ THE MANGA Even the Ending ain,t gonna worth it(watch the anime & you,ll get what i mean) in fact, NARUTO is just the most overrated anime in shounen-jump series. Its the one & only ninja anime that you can get. That,s all.",7,Recommended,"Sep 30, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a98593aa7e,21
"Naruto Shippuden is definitely one of those series where if you truly understand it, it becomes very memorable whereas if you don't then you see it as mediocre. in it's most basic form Naruto: Shippuden is a series where about a boy named Naruto who just wanted to fit in with people, become respected and acknowledged by everyone including his best friend and rival Uchiha Sasuke. Naruto just represents the unacknowledged youth of today who are ignored by society and left all alone in to rot away. now let's get down to my real review of Naruto: Shippuden Naruto's story is fairly decent enough it doesn't have the best writing of a Shonen anime but it's not bad either it's fairly good. many a times it's about how society can fck you up and make you purposeless that you start to hate society itself, but again this theme seems to be repetitive used amongst some of the major antagonists throughout the series, the plot seems fairly predictable but not as predictable as Mid Ball Z lol Shippuden also has some retcons which were never addressed by Masashi Kishimoto I won't point it out here cuz I don't wanna spoil anybody reading this review. but Naruto is definitely one of the best anime when it comes to plot-twists of the show but hpwever these twists can come off with 0 foreshadowing at all but that IMO does little to make the series look bad, Naruto has very deep real life philosophy and emphasis with characters like Itachi, Obito, Sasuke, Pain , Madara, Hashirama , Hagoromo and Naruto himself. these characters more or less have been through very tight circumstances and in each case they developed different ideologies which are very similar at the same time that they follow. these characters with do or die life situations seem to be well written, when it comes to side characters who aren't villains or anti-heroes or dudes who didnt die a long time ago Naruto does fall short for example the females Naruto seriously are some of the most laglustre in popular the only who ones who even contribute a little are Sakura, Tsunade and Konan, and even then Sakura and Konan mostly serve as supportive beta females to their male counterparts while there is also Kaguya Otsutsuki who seems interesting as a character but the way she gets introduced is very unappealing oh I almost forgot to mention that Naruto:Shippuden also has one of if not the worst written female character in anime Hinata Hyuga, a creep with no individuality who makes me sick just by appearing on screen like everytime she appears i feel like fast-forwarding. Naruto still has some good compelling side characters like Might Guy, Kakashi, Shikamaru, Choji and Sai. Naruto definitely has Immaculate art and fight scenes, Naruto's fight scenes are one of the best in anime and it's mostly thanks to chakra for being a incredible power system throughout the series even from the days of the OG Naruto, Naruto fights such as Naruto vs Pain, Kakashi vs Obito, Might Guy vs Madara will always be remembered by Anime fans for generations to come, Baruti had very good comedy too especially with the adult jokes sprinkled in between. when it comes to music Naruto: Shippuden has incredible masterpiece openings like Silhouette and Blue Bird and endings too, their music is so addicting that I think Naruto: Shippuden is the very reason why I stopped my habit of skipping the openings Overall Naruto is a series that I would recommend if you have the time to go through an anime with 100s of episodes",8,Recommended,"Sep 30, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3b41a4967d,21

"This anime is incredible, one of the best ninja stories of the entire century. Something so motivating, inspiring and beautiful that is considered a classic in the world of animation. The music, visuals and characters connect with the entirety of the human soul. Yes there are flaws, yes there are filler and so on. However that does not truly determine how amazing this story is, the history, world building, storyline and the aesthetic in general is what makes it stand out. The story is set in this blend of Japanese feudalistic society mixed in with current technological innovations, the atmosphere is set in this brutal world of war and conquest. In which there is this constant tension of war between empire like nations, in this show we get the perspective of The Hidden Leaf (Konoha). A village superpower with a diverse range of clans with different abilities. In this society we meet our protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, a mischievous boy who lives as an orphan. Compared to the original show in Shippuden, you can see him grow as a teenager and see how he matures and understands the harsh realities of human nature and the world. Simple messages are portrayed in a complex fashion especially in the upcoming arcs, were villains are too allowed their perspective and how they came to be. At times as human beings there are plenty of life lessons and reminders that Naruto Shippuden excellently shows such as the importance of loved ones and friends, a basic concept that allows human beings to bring meaning and to flourish. Secondly the importance of hatred and how traumatic events can haunt one forever, as we see in Saskue Uchiha From the characters each one has a difficult past or reality that they must deal with forever. Discrimination towards Naruto for having the nine tails inside him and the Uchiha clan, PTSD from war and a loss of comrades, and so on. Real life aspects that are expressed onto this story. On a personal level, this show has brought much inspiration, strength and reconciliation that has truly changed my teenage years as a whole. Overall this show is recommended to everyone, especially for those who are into history, philosophy, literature, mythology , cool fights scenes or simply someone who yearns for the light in times of darkness.

"I watched naruto shippuden when I was 13 years old, so while I remember a lot of it I don't really remember enough to write a detailed review. It was ok. I skipped all the filler btw. **SPOILERS AHEAD.** Not major ones, but spoilers nonetheless. Pain arc was definitely the highlight. Sakura was useless for nearly all 500 episodes. Itachi's story was really well written. The akatsuki were a well written group, and I really liked Madara. Not a fan of the Otsutsuki. A real asspull because the author couldn't figure out how Naruto and Sasuke could defeat Madara. So overall I'd say it's ok.

"I keep my reviews short, simple, and to the point for those of you who don’t want to read the rest of these essays. If you liked Naruto, you will like naruto shippuden, it is absolutely worth your time. Do not watch shippuden unless you have already seen the 2002 naruto. This is a continuation of naruto. The fights are hype, the new villains are awesome, and there’s a huge improvement in characters. The world is expanded on even further, the story picks up and is fast paced. The powers get even cooler. We are blessed with some awesome music/openings. It gets surprisingly emotional at times, which you would not expect of this show. There are some must see fight scenes with legendary animation and build up. It has a problem with too many repetitive flashbacks, but you can skip through them so it isn’t unbearable. It sets up nicely for Boruto, which is the next continuation, while leaving you with a satisfying and conclusive end even if you are never to watch boruto. There are filler episodes like in the 2002 naruto and as I said in that review you can skip them and not miss out on the story, however if you have the time I would still go ahead and check them out if you are a fan. You can also just go back and watch them after you finish the main show. They are enjoyable and I do not regret sitting through them.

"""Naruto Shippuuden"" gets me nostalgic AF. It's the one anime that you can't stop thinking about for weeks after completion.The story and the plot is pretty awesome. Action scenes were also nice. Sometimes the animation sucked, but the story took care of it. For example, the pain arc .It has some plot holes, like deidora could use self explosion repeatedly in edo form. But the only thing that keeps me away from rating it a 10 is its ""FILLERS"". The first impression of 500 episodes scares the shit out of people .Still, overall it is a pretty decent one .I would highly recommend anyone who has patience and guts to watch it.

"Naruto Shippuden is a legendary anime. It is old and it it brings back memories from the childhood. From the beginning i want to say that i only put 9 on overall because the enjoyment pull down the grade (i did put 6 because of fillers. 41% of the anime is with fillers). [this review may contain spoilers!!!] 1. STORY: The story is amazing. It is about a ninja that want to become the best one and he also wants to become the hokage (LEADER) of the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha). The story got many good things but the story is also sad sometimes (some character die). From the beginning of series Narut, the main character is looking for his friend that left the village and join the Orochimaru team (Orochimaru is a villain). The story is most based on finding Sasuke (his lost friend). So i thing in the end the story is ok. Beginning and the End are so good 2. ART: The art it's very good because the Naruto shippuden was started in 2007 and in comparison with other anime the art and graphics are cool. 3. SOUND: The sound is amazing. It is so different from the others. It brings me old memories. 4. Characters: The characters from this masterpiece are incredible. One of them i think are made in joke because are so useless in the anime but Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Obito, Kakashi, Madara, The 4th Hokake, etc. are so powerfull, good costumizated and got lot of good personality. 5. Enjoyment: The anime is very good but the fillers are so annoying because they are in the middle of a good fight or somthing light that. I am saying it again: there are 41% of the anime fillers..... -----Overall----- The anime is great but the fillers are annoying. So the anime is 9/10 but i will give 10/10 because it brings me good memories of chilhood.",9,Recommended,"Mar 25, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_947c77c506,21
"Ok first I loved this show. Well it entertained me so much.it entairned me for 7years .It taught some best life leasson that you can't learn from school .Well the fillers are high but some of them are good and some of them are serious waste of time. Well when I started to watch it the land of mist arc was not that much good but after that the chunin exam were the greatest arc in the og we got to see lot abt characters like neji, lee, ino-shika-cho trio, hinata, shino kina etc after the gaara's introduction and legendary sannins were great. And in shippiden we have got more characters. Villians: I think u can get more great villians in naruto than most animes like first we got orochimaru then itachi kisame and the whole Akatsuki. The pain was a badass and his arc changed everything. But the real master of manipulation were tobi and madara. Madara was built different. Story writing: The story was good but at the war arc it was whole twisted and our beloved villian doesn't get a good ending bad story writing of the whole arc. Character: characters were good except girls like sakura, ino, ten ten. But the male characters were good written. Tips: Naruto is a God anime my tip is that you don't have watch all fillers because it is not connected to story. And some fillers at last of the series were important ( ie, hagoromo's past) beside this everything is good.

"A very reasonable title, cut with filler and flashbacks to the point of being barely watchable much of the time. When in doubt, jump to a flashback. If in doubt about a flashback, put a flashback in your flashback. Are we at the climax of the series? Better bump it up to 90% flashback content. Can't remember what's going on because of all the flashbacks? Better recap — with a flashback. The producers of the Naruto Shippuden anime milked what I assume was a pretty good manga for easily three to four times its value by turning exceptionally bad hack writers loose on the story between installments of the manga, and by... well, it's like that time...

"Oh, indeed it's the ever so popular Naruto Shippuden. Ready to waste mindless hours watching yet another dragged on Shounen Anime? I sure am! Story: It's Naruto! Of course the story is going to be pretty sappy looking. Ya'know with the Sasuke and bonds stuff. But the thing is it is executed well. So the anime in the nutshell is. Naruto has left Konoha for a period of 3 years with The Legendary Sennin Jiraiya. Within these 3 years he has been training for future endeavors. Aswell within these 3 years everyone seems to hit puberty and have a major growth spurt. The former chunnin ninja have become adept, some of which have become jounin. After Naruto's fated return. His team is reunited with the classic bell retrieval test. Sakura and Naruto work together to steal the bells. They both demonstrate magnificent skill. Resulting in the reconsaince of Team Kakashi. However Kakashi is always missing or injured so Team Kakashi is lacking as a team. A mysterious new ninja and a Anbu member join the team. This is when the ultimate goal of Team Kakashi uncovers. To retrieve Sasuke and destroy Akatsuki. Seems Legit 8/10. Art: The art has improved over the original resulting a much more enjoyable experience. However overuse of certain animations is a huge turn off. Seeing the same traveling animation is quite irritating. Character Models however are very well thought out and designed. 6/10 Sound: I'm a sucker for good OPs, and NS has a good amount. Specifically Sha La La. Aswell the voice actors did a magnificent job. They aged everyones voice quite well. This would be a perfect 10 if it did not lack in actual Sound Effects which would be reused to death. 8/10.

"I should mention that I binge-watched this show and skipped about 95% of the fillers. I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Naruto Shippuden takes place about 2.5 years after the events which transpired in the original Naruto series. Sasuke Uchiha deserted the Hidden Leaf Village and joined up with the sinister Orochimaru to gain more power in his quest to kill his brother and avenge his family. Naruto Uzumaki decided to train with Jiraiya in order to improve his skill so he could get Sasuke back to his side. Meanwhile the threat of the organization called Akatsuki drives ever closer, who are out to capture Naruto. The story is rarely the strong point of a shonen anime. It often comes down to a villain who is drunk on power and who wants to take control of the world. In that regard Naruto Shippuden is not that much different. At the start it’s simple, but effective. Without spoiling too much I found that the story did get a bit too convoluted at the end, but I imagine it can be difficult to try and wrap it all up. I will say however that almost each villain has his own unique reason for why they want to achieve world domination. In some cases, I found myself even sympathizing with the villains. The line between good and bad is blurry and often there are flashbacks which explain why a villain has had a change of heart and why he or she has those different ideologies. There are a lot of interesting and tragic themes such as pain, isolation and destiny. These different motivations bring more depth to the villains. This is why I found the characters to be the best part of the show. There is the typical shonen protagonist Naruto Uzumaki. He is a total goofball, yet very dependable at the same time. He works and trains the hardest and he has the ability to connect with other people. He’s a good main character and I found myself cheering for him throughout the whole show. Sasuke Uchiha at the other hand is the complete opposite of Naruto. He is “cool”, very talented, all the girls swoon over him, but he struggles with himself and mainly with his past. Even throughout the original Naruto show I found Sasuke to be a very polarizing character. At points I disliked him and at other points I sort of liked him. This trend continued for me in Naruto Shippuden. Then there are a lot of other characters, who all have their own powers and weaknesses. We of course have all the Hidden Leaf Ninjas. We get introduced to ninjas from other villages. Some characters from the past get more fleshed out. Finally, we have the villains. I already made mention of the them up above. Pain and Itachi are some of my favorite characters in any anime ever. So, all in all that leaves us with more than 50 important characters. All of them are unique and you’ll find yourself picking favorites for some of these characters. Some of them focus on long distance, while others are hand to hand combat specialists. If you watched the original Naruto you will know there is a big difference between a Shikamaru or a Rock Lee fight. The main problem with having so many characters however is that not every character gets developed or his/her time to shine. In the original Naruto show we saw minor characters having proper 1 on 1 fights during the Chunin Exams and during the Sasuke Recovery arcs. They got multiple episodes and often you saw flashbacks of their pasts. This way you got interested in some of those characters and you had your favorites. Because so many new characters get introduced during Shippuden – and since we do not have THAT many villains – some of these ninjas do not get any fights during the whole of Shippuden. This is a shame since I was invested in some of them and subsequently didn’t get to see if they learned new techniques or improved. Their characters in effect didn’t develop much / at all. In addition, there is also a bit too much powering up going on to my liking. The fighting, the techniques and the damage inflicted all get turned up a few scales. Some characters even get buffed/evolve multiple times during one fight, which makes them literally (demi) gods. Other characters meanwhile stay behind. I believe this is called power creep? Another strong point of this show is the setting, the world of Naruto. How someone can come up with ideas and concepts like ninja villages, ninjutsu, genjutsu, kages, tailed beasts and how all that stuff is connected, is beyond me. It’s genius and it’s all carefully laid out and explained in this show. Just like in the original Naruto show, the soundtrack is amazing. There are some tracks which will pump you up for another great fight, and there are tracks which will hit you right in the feels. There are 20 different openings and 40 different endings. I’m sure you will find something you like and dislike. Personally, I liked the opening track called Silhouette by KANA-BOON the most. The animation is good. It can be a bit inconsistent and there is an obvious change of pace when high action episodes occur. I like the style of animation which gets used during those high actions episodes. It is more fluid, but I could understand if people didn’t like it. The fights and more specifically the hand to hand combat scenes are often amazing; even mesmerizing. I don’t like it though when the animation in openings already spoil upcoming events or matchups. This happened a couple of times. I feel like I also should mention something about the fillers. I binge-watched Naruto Shippuden and I skipped 95% of the fillers. I recommend you to do the same. I watched about 80 fillers of the original Naruto and they were mostly dreadful. 40% of the episodes are fillers so look on some website or in the forums here to find out which episodes are skippable. I recommend watching the Kakashi and Itachi focused fillers. They were enjoyable. The downside of binge-watching is that some of the repeated flashbacks are skippable as well. There are so many flashbacks in Naruto. It’s insane how often they for example showed Sasuke’s past with Itachi. I get that it’s really important, but they’ll show you the exact same scene about 5 times. If you watch 1 episode per week these flashbacks might be welcome (although I can imagine these kinds of viewers would rather want new and original content), but if you watch all the episodes in rapid succession then I’d say the repeated flashbacks are filler-esque too, unless you have a terrible memory. Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed this anime. I binge-watched this at a high pace during a somewhat difficult time in my life. I was always curious to find out what was going to happen next. At some point I was thinking about giving this a 10/10, but I decided with a 9.5/10 because of some nitpicking during the final arc. A day after I watched the final episode I just had a bit of an empty feeling as a huge, fun part of my evening and night disappeared. I am sad it ended, but I really enjoyed the ride. Let’s hope Boruto will prove to be a worthy sequel.",9,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ae75dc99a1,22
"Naruto Shippuden is a masterful continuation of Naruto's story, and as a series it even manages to improve upon its' predecessor - an anime which already needed little improving, in my opinion. Still, it has its' own drawbacks which will be off putting for some viewers, which I'll go over. The story provides more of the action adventure found in Naruto, while the plot really matures appropriate to the characters' ageing up. The mysterious Akatsuki organisation establish a threat right from the start, while maintaining suspense through many episodes as each character is revealed slowly, one at a time. These villains provide situations that feel truly perilous for our heroes, and the show packs in a solid handful of emotional gut-punches throughout. The arcs are varied enough to hold the viewer's interest across a long series, and bring focus to characters other than Naruto; as well as battling Akatsuki members, there are arcs focused on Naruto's training, on Sasuke's activities, or on revealing important mysteries and backstories. Now, there are still weak points to the story. There are some overpowered techniques conveniently used, such as Izanagi, Rinne Rebirth, or the 100 Healings. Several times characters are saved from certain death by such powers. While this might be an annoyance for viewers at times, ultimately I think Naruto has enough tragedy in its premise and across Shippuden's story, without becoming bleak by piling up too many corpses of beloved characters. Towards the end the story does teeter on the edge of the trap of 'too many villain reveals': ""I'm the villain- no I'M the real villain- no, fools, it was me all along!"". This isn't Shippuden's strongest hour, but it does serve to add a cool sense of destiny and fated conflict for our heroes, so if you enjoy that kind of element in stories, you won't be displeased. And - ultimately - the real final conflict is the one you knew was coming since the very beginning of Naruto, and when it comes at long last, it won't disappoint. To me, it delivers an emotionally charged and satisfying payoff to a series which I have followed for many years, and it's an arc I am happy to rewatch regularly. Overall, there are no unanswered questions left at the end, no frustrating ambiguity, and I think it is well worth spending 500 episodes to reach such a satisfying conclusion. The characters have always been Naruto's strongest asset, and that's no different in Shippuden. Our protagonists have spent time becoming stronger, they're more emotionally mature and (sometimes) wiser. My favourite example of this development across the time skip is Sakura, who really comes into her own in Shippuden. There is still plenty of room for growth for them across the series, and we get to see many of the large cast shine on their own. The histories of some fan favourite characters are slowly revealed, to great effect, any many new characters are added to the cast. By far and away the greatest of these new additions is that most beloved villain organisation in anime: the Akatsuki! And they're beloved for good reason. They are equal parts intimidating and badass; at times even goofy. They range from sympathetic anti-heroes, to assholes who are having so much fun being assholes that you can't help but love them a little bit. Each member is given adequate screen time to showcase their unique abilities and personalities, but even so, they're so enjoyable to spend time with that it's almost bittersweet to see them defeated; I just can't get enough of watching them. Of course, within any show, not every character can be perfect, and for me in Shippuden, Karin really takes the crown as the worst character in the entire Naruto-verse. Constantly annoying and adds nothing to the plot. Fortunately she is only a minor character, so we're not overrun with screen time for her. Conversely, the character of Killer B, who I admit I find tiresome at times in the manga, I actually find less annoying and more tolerable in the anime. The last thing I'll mention in terms of character is the slight pitfall which I think Shippuden falls into during it's latter half; that is a still expanding cast of less important characters. While they retain unique and memorable character design, the addition of a new set of characters from the nations neighbouring the Land of Fire ultimately doesn't add all that much to the story. I think this is because there isn't enough time to develop them much at the late stage of the anime, and they end up relying largely on gimmicks rather than fleshed out personalities (examples are the Fifth Mizukage and Omoi). This just means that if these characters are in peril, it's hard to care too much about it. The music in this series is absolutely outstanding. There is a new composer, Yasuhara Takanashi, who continues many elements and themes as to feel like a seamless transition between series, while introducing many beautiful pieces of his own, and appropriately badass character themes for many new villains. Some of the most standout tracks of the OST are Senya (or Many Nights), Girei, and Hyouhaku (or Wandering). It's an OST that I have continued to listen to frequently for more than 10 years. Of the many opening songs, a couple are average; the rest range from good to brilliant. The best ones do their job of pumping you up for the action, and provide an emotional kick for viewers invested in the characters. The best examples of this are Blue Bird, Sign, Diver, and Silhouette. Special mention also goes to Hero's Come Back!!, which was perfectly chosen as the first opening of Shippuden. It you come to this anime after Naruto and aren't pumped already, then this opening does that job for you - the song coupled with animation that includes a really badass shot of the mysterious Akatsuki organisation is enough to get anyone excited. To note; I watch the English dub, and I enjoy it immensely. I have still watched plenty of episodes in Japanese, as for most of the time I watched it the English dubbed episodes were a little behind the Japanese release; I don't think there's any notable shift in tone or quality between the two, so whichever one you prefer I think will be equally enjoyable. A notable mention goes to Vic Mignogna and Michael Yurchack who both voice versions of a character who is introduced later in the series, and stood out to me as unique and memorable voices for an important character. There's little to say about the art other than: it's just good. It's pleasant to look at, and the fight scenes are visually exciting. The lines look cleaner than it's predecessor. The palette retains a lot of it's vibrancy, though it becomes desaturated through certain arcs appropriate to the tone of the story, as our heroes face more serious threats and losses. The main drawback of Shippuden is much the same as Naruto's: an excessive amount of filler. And unlike it's predecessor the filler arcs are interspersed throughout the main story, so if you are intent on avoiding them, it takes a little more effort to do so (i.e. looking up filler lists online). However, I would say that some of the filler is quite enjoyable; the different tailed-beast arcs, Kakashi's Anbu arc, and Itachi's Shinden arc spring to mind. Also, a lot of the filler in later episodes tries to delve into some of the supporting characters, rather than being just meaningless monster-of-the-week fodder. Additionally, some later filler arcs are actually based on light novels that accompany the manga, rather than being anime-only. Ultimately, I think the filler isn't as big an issue for new viewers as it was for fans watching along as episodes were released (it could certainly make you impatient when waiting for the story to advance, back in the day); but any new viewer can use their discretion to decide whether to watch or skip ahead. Overall, Naruto and Shippuden have retained their position as my favourite anime of all time since I first started watching, more than a decade ago. I love being immersed in the world and I find the central themes and conflicts to be heartening, and emotionally satisfying. There are several arcs that I enjoy rewatching regularly on their own, and at any given point I'm itching to rewatch the whole series again, filler and all. For fans of Naruto I think it's highly worth seeing how the story develops and concludes in Shippuden. For viewers who are reluctant to watch Naruto (maybe it seems a little young) and want to jump in at Shippuden, I think it's possible. The backstories of the characters are revisited enough that it's probably not too hard to understand or follow, though I do think you'd be missing out on some critical character bonding from the first part.",10,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fa6f19d32b,22
"Original Naruto is probably my most beloved anime of all time. I would always go back and watch any arc and still find something that makes me watch 20-30 more episodes without feeling bored. Music is fantastic, animation is very good for the time being and plot for is very complex and yet simple to understand. I wish i could say same thing about Shippuuden. First 3-4 arcs kept the same pace and value to plot as original story. As i personally find Gaara arc not as great as later one i still can see meaning to be there. It introduced whole new enemy for protagonists and served as jump for series to more mature climate which i was hoping to stay until the end. Orochimaru/Sasuke and Shikamaru arcs only proved that this direction was right and gave us fantastic and memorable moments. I was invested in every single character introduced to the series up till this point in the series and waited for new episode to come out with excitement and hype. Until of course infamous Pain arc that started with big impact and ended with probably most awful and mediocre way that became the solution for every single problem in the anime. That is of course Naruto being the messiah that turns every enemy into his friend and make everything meaningless that happens in the past. Akatsuki mystery and threat built for almost half of the Shippuuden was just scrapped and every following arc became predictable despite having lot of turning points and amazing fights. The War had some great fights and showcases of characters but who cared at this point, because it was so stretched and had probably most fillers in history of anime ever. And of course we had 3 switches of main antagonist in like 2 years without ending a single battle. It became unwatchable and even animation started to look awful somewhere on the road. As much as i love Naruto franchise overall, i honestly can't give Shippuuden any score higher than 5. It showed potential at the beginning but it was butchered in the end. I find that just sad and i wish that show had more great storytelling and animation.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 3, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c11f66c49e,22
"Naruto shippuden had great promise but was ultimately let down, let me explain. Lets start with what Naruto shippuden does well. Its characters: A diverse and interesting set of characters and while there is a lot it feels like the majority of them get enough screen time and backstory to justify them being there. The world: Naruto shippudens world is truly something to behold, Just the fact that its a world full of ninjas with different clans is cool enough but its a lot more than just that, As the show grows so does the world and we the viewer slowly starts to grasp just how intricate and mysterious it can be. Fights: While there are good and bad fights in every shounen for such a long show Naruto does have a consistent amount of good ones, Like other shounens such as Bleach these fights are gripping due to the fact that each ninja and ninja clan have a diverse set of tools and jutsus (techniques/ability's) giving us something new and fresh pretty much every fight. Moving on to what the show does ok at best. Animation: Super inconsistent. One episode can look great because they wanted to put a bit more budget into it and then the episode after can look nothing like the last, This can be demoralising and disappointing for a viewer who is expecting consistent animation. The show can look great but only if they want it to which most of the time is not the case as they want to save money. Sound (OP's/ED's): The openings and ending at the start of the show are a wonder to listen to they really put you in the right mood to enjoy the show no complaints here except for the fact that the openings gradually get a tiny bit worse throughout but that is bound to happen. The problem lies in the sound/music that happens during the episode itself not at the end or start. The music to me is too slow and sombre for what the anime is centered around which is ninjas and keep in mind these are not the type of ninjas who meditate they are the ones who throw goddamn meteors out of the sky (get what i am saying). I am not saying its bad its just ok, average if you will. Now lets get on to the bad: The story: The story of Naruto shippuden as a whole is fine in fact i would consider it good as it keeps the viewer watching by slowly revealing more about the world and whats really going on under the surface but its just not enough to save it from the curse that is fillers. 42% of Naruto shippuden is filler , Yes you heard me correct, No i am not memeing 42 goddamn percent , mother of god. Before you go crazy hear me out, While a large portion of Naruto shippuden is filler its not necessarily bad filler and to be honest i think some of the filler is needed as there are so many characters that get their backstory from said fillers, but even with that being said it is just way way too much and unfortunately because of this filler another problem rises from the ground like a weed. With loads of fillers comes pacing issues and these aren't some minor pacing issues because while a lot of fillers are obviously going to be slow paced the fillers actually make the pacing of the non filler episodes suffer aswell, also if you choose to skip fillers you will miss out on a lot of character development and backstory as that is the general use of them in the show, its a lose lose situation. I could rant about this for days but lets leave it there for now. Now that i have mentioned the good, the ok and the ugly lets move on to. Overall thoughts: Naruto shippuden is your classic shounen and because of this it suffers from the classic shounen problems those being terrible pacing and horrendous amounts of filler episodes which hold back what could have been an incredible show thanks to the awesome characters and world, Leaving the show only average towards the end. If you don't mind slow pacing and a huge amount of filler and give the show a fair shot you may find yourself entranced by Naruto shippuden's character and world building.",7,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_480a946127,22
"this show was average at best, half the show was filler and the other half was just meh for the most part. i felt that my enjoyment for the show peaked at the pain arc, but then after that it was just me finishing the show because i was already halfway through and i figured i might as well finish the show. 500 episodes of a meh anime, i no watch again :) but in all seriousness i did enjoy a fair bit of the show, mainly the first half and remember that this is just my opinion so if you liked it, that just means you found something good in this show that i did not and i hope you did cause otherwise thats 500 episodes down the drain",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 28, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_eac7e9b6d3,22
"This review is for all of the Naruto series. ""a 7/10 show with 12/10 moments."" This quote, along with the addition of some 10/10 characters, sums up my experience with the Naruto series pretty well. I am in no way saying that Naruto Shippuuden along with it's prequel are flawless pieces of media, in fact far from it, but I cannot ignore the lasting impact this show managed to place on me. I believe it's important to take this show for what it is rather than allow ourselves to be blinded by nostalgia, so to quickly bring up some of the problems within the series I'll start with the frankly terrible writing of majority of the female characters. It is no secret that the girls in this show have some downright pitiful writing compared to the male ones, and there really isn't any way to excuse that. Throughout the majority of the show the girl characters seem to be used as plot devices to help forward the development of the primarily male cast, and seeing as Naruto is a battle shounen, this unfortunately comes as little surprise to me. Aside from this obvious fault, the other main problem that I'm sure everyone has heard much about is the sheer amount of filler. It is an undeniable fact that if your show is 700+ episodes long with over 40% of those being filler, there's a problem. This being said however, I understand why this was done, and don't see a problem if you choose to skip the filler episodes as Naruto is already a long series as is. Personally however, as long as I like the characters, I can find enjoyment in some filler arcs, that is if they are not shoved in the middle of an important story arc. There are other flaws such as the poor writing of the over 200 episode long war arc and the lack luster finale of this serious commitment of a show, but setting aside the bad lets touch on what makes this series so good. My love for the Naruto series stems from the pure attachment you get to it's characters, I mean how can you not after spending 720 episodes watching them grow and achieve their goals, as well as suffer from loss and hardships. It may sound cheesy, but after basically growing up with these characters for years of my childhood, they hold a special place in my heart, and therefore the impact of character death or growth hits that much harder. Something I really commend the Naruto series for is the writing of the ""villains."" They have you questioning what is truly good and evil, with most all the villains having a clear and sometimes rather convincing motive for why they do what they do, which is something I don't see too often in shows. Often times in media villains are just chocked up to the baseless cliche of ""taking over the world"" or just being downright comically evil, but I don't see that happening in Naruto. It is really hard to hate most of this shows antagonists, as you find yourself questioning whether these ""bad guys"" are really all that bad. In a classic battle of ideologies mixed with some beautifully choreographed fight scenes, the clash between the expansive cast of equally lovable characters is something you can't look away from. Aside from the villains, the rivalry explored between our main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, is what I believe to be one of the most enthralling dynamics in all of shounen. Watching the unbroken dance of emotions surrounding these two as they combat each other in passionate battles of skill and wit, as well as the internal mental conflict that they each face, is one of the most emotionally investing stories that I've had the joy of experiencing. Between the constant battle of love and hatred they feel for one another and the shattered bonds they share with their own home and family, the war going on within these two boys' minds and hearts is sincerely something to behold. It truly is a wonderful journey of growth and acceptance that while full of pain and heartbreak along the way, ultimately reaches a a conclusion that is wholeheartedly worth it. I find myself going back to watch the finale of their concluding fight more than I'd like to admit, but it's just that good. This iconic duo is one that is sure to be remembered for years to come. TLDR; Naruto has the power to make you fall head over heels for it's characters and world, you'll find yourself laughing and crying along side them, and before you know it the once daunting series may start to not feel as long. By the end I was yearning for more, wishing to see my favorite shinobi go on more adventures together, strengthening their bonds, experiencing joys and sorrows, and most of all continuing to make the Naruto series what it is; an experience worth remembering. I can safely say that while Naruto has undoubtedly gone down in history as one of the most iconic anime series out there, the lessons and emotions that came along with it will be forever etched in our hearts as well.",8,Recommended,"Jan 19, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f9e646e783,22
"So, I loved Naruto Part 1, and then I watched Shippuden, really excited for more Naruto, especially after everyone hyped it up for me. What I got is one of the most boring, mediocre anime I've ever seen. At least in the shonen genre. Let's begin with the story. STORY: After the amazing arcs in part 1, I was ready for some more amazing writing. Well, the first arc in Shippuden bored me out of my mind. I literally dropped the series for a few months just because I couldn't watch it. The second arc, Tenchi Bridge was a little bit more enjoyable, but we basically got a Kakashi and Sasuke rip off, taking the worst elements of both of the characters and creating two horrible new useless characters! The third arc was ok, it felt kind of dragged on in the 3rd act but it was good overall. The 4th arc brought Shippuden back the the writing of part 1, and oh my god it was amazing. There was tons of emotion, rich character development, and amazing fights and moments, just like part 1. I didn't like the ending to the arc, but it was mediocre at worst. The 4th arc was amazing over all. The 5th arc kind of felt dragged out, and it had poor character writing with Sasuke, Naruto and Sakura that I'll get into soon. It was really just set up for the 6th arc. The 6th arc was a giant arc, that had some amazing moments that I still love, great fights, and a amazing villain, probably one of my favorite villains of all time, but even then felt dragged out, boring and had HORRIBLE character writing. And don't get me started to the ending of Shippuden. It made me hate the show for giving me one of the worst endings ever, after I had spent over 500 episodes watching it. And there was a hell of a lot of filler, which I got fed up with and just pulled out a filler list and skipped all of the filler. Over all, the story was bad at some parts, ok at some parts, and AMAZING at other parts. It did have a ton of potential. 7/10. ART: The visuals sucked ass. I hated the art so much that it gave me eye cancer. Of course, when the show wanted to, it looked amazing. A few moments that I don't wanna spoil come to mind. Compared to part 1's bright visuals, its shit when they make it too bland and dark. Overall, 6/10. SOUND: Compared to the happy and amazing music of part 1, shippudens's music(apart from the op's and ed's) was horrible. I srsly hated this music. Its just a bunch of violins just screeching. Overall: 3/10. CHARACTER: Some characters get development, but most get pushed to the side. Shikamaru gets a ton of development. but Kiba gets none. Its just shit character writing. Sasuke has some of the worst development in anime, like this guy goes from wanting to kill his bro, to wanting to do some crazy crap that I think made no sense. Sakura had development at the start of Shippuden, but then goes back to being a Sasuke simp pretty soon. Naruto also becomes a complete Sasuke simp, always chasing after him and wanting him to come back. Sasuke literally told him a billion times to just stay away from him and stop being annoying. But Naruto just can't do that, huh? Kakashi barely gets development other than us learning his back story. And don't get me started on talk no jutsu. Remember when Naruto convinced Zabuza to be a good guy at the very end? Yeah now he does that with almost every villain in the story. It sucks. But I won't lie, some characters do get character development. So overall its a 6/10. ENJOYMENT: Even though there was numerous problems, I actually had a fun time watching Shippuden. I did get really bored in the first arc, and during the war. But in the other arcs had fun. It was an enjoyable ride, but I couldn't enjoy it as much as part 1 because of how shit everything else was. Overall: 7/10. OVERALL: I thought it was decent. So a 4/10. I will still recommend it if u watched part 1 of naruto and loved it a hell of a lot. But don't except the same amazing writing, character, and all the other stuff. It doesn't help that Chakra just gets way too OP by the end of the show and it just becomes DBZ. But overall if u are gonna watch it, skip the filler, and anything u think is unecesary. See ya, and I hope this review helped.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 24, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4f1e8bf333,22
"Naruto is an amazing anime that everyone should enjoy. The story is just amazing, they have such a great focus on all the character, you will definitely like every character, and not only the main people. Also they use the ""set up pull off"" technic very well, there are a lot of surprises along the way aswell whitch will definitely take you off guard. I have been emotianally toutched many times in this anime, which was not something that I thought i would be when I first started watching it. The music is simply amazing, both the intro and outro songs, but also the random songs that gets played. It is absolutely amazing and really helps the atmosphere. As far as i know, this is one of the best anime that is out there and it is definitely worth watching If I should point out some of the bad things (which there are) then it has to be that there are so many episodes that it is starting to look like it will never end. Also there are so many fillers in there, and it can get kind of enoying at times.

"I have to say, I dropped Naruto for a while and was ready to throw in the towel on the series. Then Shippuuden came along. The first few episodes in this series show growth in Naruto, something I waited desperately for, but he actually partially regresses as time moves on. Also, there was nothing really interesting happening around him. In fact, the two most interesting story arcs in Shippuuden were all about other characters. And what happens to Naruto while we're given an in-depth character development of a character that we've never seen before, that's not important to the overall plot and that we know will be defeated? Naruto jumps on logs. He jumps on logs chasing a guy whose power is to create clay birds. That's several episodes where all Naruto does is jump on logs, in a circle, trying to catch this clay guy. Yeah... All in all, Naruto Shippuuden is much like Naruto. It has some great moments, but it's just not worth looking through all the crap between them. Shippuuden seems to have fewer filler episodes and more filler content and bad writing. It's not the worst anime series out there, but to me it's just a big waste of time.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 16, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a04b9ad502,22

So Sasuke ended up having a child with her after he tried killing her, leaving for 2 years, planning to kill and destroy everything and everyone she loved. Yea oh and after that he then leaves her to be a single mother. Good job kiddo. Oh did I mention she is also useless. Overall: 6 While my review is only pointing out the flaws of this series I have to say I enjoyed my time with the Naruto series in general. Most of it is nostalgia cause Naruto was my gateway into more anime. Naruto is not a perfect anime. You can't give something a 10/10 if it has a flaw. Naruto has many flaws but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. We have to remember to actually set aside the nostalgia. Look at Boruto.. doesn't feel just like a quick cash. In conclusion I liked Naruto but as time went on it didn't hold up. Thanks for reading my review and have a Merry Christmas -Love Santa P.S I don't proof read my reviews I find it cringey so a lot of grammer issues and spelling mitakes will be made. I do proof read my college essays though so don't judge me.",6,Mixed Feelings,"May 30, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_53a90d65cd,22
"I don't remember the exact last episode I watched, but this show is garbage and everyone should steer clear of it. I watched every episode of Naruto when they aired starting the year the show received an English dub. I stopped during the final arc of the show. I had highly enjoyed the show through much of it and I don't think I'd take those moments back. However, I cannot recommend this show whatsoever to anyone. The studio who made this show MILKED their FANS for money. The manga had been completed at the time the show decided to start running filler in the middle of their final arc. I have spent 7 years watching this show as a loyal fan and I stopped during the final arc. It's because the filler they started doing in the middle of the final arc lasted for over 2.5 years. I waiting 2 years to let episodes build up so my father and I could watch roughly 120 episodes together and binge it hard. There were only 3 canon episodes released within those 2.5 years and the manga had been finished that whole time, meaning the studio was purposely writing 2.5 years of filler to make money from view counts. It's absolutely disgusting. Then to top it all off they made the damn Boruto movie before they even finished the Naruto Shippuuden anime. I am so mad and disappointed. I will never watch another anime from this garbage studio again. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different studio's show. They'll probably care more about their fans and give you an enjoyable show.",2,Not Recommended,"Oct 9, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_35a3bec240,22
"Naruto: Shippuden for me, is considered to be an era-defining show; It was something that was culturally influential for the time it was established and arguably STILL is to this day, and has helped shape what anime is generally today. Its by no means a perfect show, and that's what the detail of this review is for. But for what it is, it's something I do recommend people to watch and find themselves to invest their time in when they could. Animation (8/10) - This was a show that ran from 2007 - 2017; Standing the test of time generally, it's animation style is starting to become definitive for its time. It doesn't hurt the viewing experience that much imo, but I do have to say: In comparison to its continuation, Naruto (2002), this one have a noticeably better quality. The movements of the characters are more fluid, and has a more expressive tones onto it. I guess the only criticism I have is Studio Pierrot Co. (its producers), must've started slacking or doing budget cuts at the later parts of its run after The Great War arc concluded because its definition plummeted at around 480-500 episodes deep with some characters lacking details and shading as they used to. But for the majority of its run, I think they did a good job. Storyline (9/10) - Compared to Naruto (2002), this one has a much RICHER storyline. It still bottomlines on the occurrence of The Great War, but all the major arcs that leads slowly onto that progression is seriously action-packed and filled with sensational expositions. A lot of its side characters, especially the antagonists are also well-written in terms of their backstories, purposes and so, that you can't help but appreciate both the spectrum of good and evil as the conflicts unfolds. Also has a lot of blowing and major deaths so, keep your heads up for that. I guess one of the major flaw that I have that kept it from being a 10: Is the excruciating filler episodes and arcs they have. And sometimes they even come along in the MIDDLE of the main arc! As a breather I suppose or to extend their runtime? Idk but it's definitely annoying. Just like Naruto (2002), sometimes it would only be a couple of episodes which can be bearable but there are instances where it could span up to 10-12 eps or something. So it's like a Russian Roulette. And oftentimes those fillers don't even have any direct affect to the main story, so its basically just a waste of time. Definitely the drawback to its perfection. Music (9/10) - Having ten years of total time to simmer on the kitchen, it definitely had a lot of time to cook a lot of bangers and a versatile soundtrack library. It still has its trademark of Traditional Japanese-like thematic mostly on its background music that implements a rich flavor of woodwind, strings and percussion harmonies. But in terms of OSTs, it invested a lot on Japanese Rock which they did very well because a lot of the famous songs associated with the show came from this type of genre. Most notably Blue Bird, Silhouette, Sign and more, typically relying on fast-paced guitar riffs, crashing drums and snares, raw and energetic vocals into a singularity of a melody; The type of thing that would make your head bang and get drawn onto the tunes. Very lit, if you'd ask me. So props to that. Overall - 8.66 out of 10",9,Recommended,"Jun 9, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_624fe98859,22
"Throughout the first part and all of Shippuden, I had to endure the stupid MC and disgusting personality Sakura, which is definitely a downside. But I started watching Naruto as a kid, so it would have been a shame not to check it out. I mostly watched it for characters like Kakashi, Madara, and Sai, because these characters are really interesting, use their brains, and have something to convey, unlike the two mentioned characters. Generally, the world and story are interesting. If Naruto came out now, I wouldn't watch it because of too many useless episodes, but I watched it because of nostalgia. 9/10, and of course, because of Madara, who remains one of the best ""villains"" in anime.I put the word 'villain' in quotation marks because his goal is the dream of every mature person a dystopia where people would be much happier than in the presented world",9,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 7, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1c2da3dfd5,22
"Naruto is my favorite anime of all time. I've been following it since 2010 and since then, I've watched many animes. Still, nothing compares to it. Attack on Titan may come as second, but it's no way near it. The theme is just too brilliant. It's something that never ever came into my mind. I really like the world of ninjas depicted in this show. I like the idea of Jutsu and Chakra. I love the fights. I love the backstories of each character. The characters' development is incredibly consistent. The show will fill you with many emotions: inspiring, charming, funny, sad, etc. The arcs and fights will blow your mind: it's strategic, a trait that many others lack; it's wholesome, not just punching around like a sh*t or throwing random powers like Dragon Ball and One Piece. I have too many favorite fights and arcs that make it impossible to list here, but the best one is certainly The Pain Invasion. That being said, sadly this amazing show has to suffer from many of what I call ""anime's fallacies"". They are defects that lower the anime's potential. These didn't happen very often, tho, gladly. But, I'm a very logical person, and I love to have a show to be logical if it's meant to be. - The main characters shall not be dead because we'll lose many fans / we cannot make up their subsequent story. - Forget about side characters, just let them be punching bags. - Mouthful during fights. The characters bother explaining his plot after defeating his opponent (they did this so that the viewer can also understand, but it's nonsense. It should be explained with flashback). - Show the greatness of the villain by nerfing (making weak) the good characters. - The level of power has to increase dramatically over time (you know, in the Naruto series, kunai and shuriken were still a weapon to kill enemies. In Shippuden, they were just an adornment). The first fallacy makes many illogical events happen. (spoiler alert! skip this paragraph if you haven't watched yet). Because of the author's insistence on keeping the main characters alive, Gaara and Kakashi had to be revived by some weird Jutsu. Choji and Ino didn't die after being suffocated by Kakuzu. Sasuke didn't die after being stabbed by Madara on his heart. All five kages didn't die after being knocked down by Madara. C'mon, have the courage to kill them. Did Death Note lose his fanbase after killing L, its favorite character? Did AOT lose after killing Sasha and Captain Erwin? The last fallacy is what I dislike most. It went from Zabuza's level -> Pain's level -> Madara's level -> Kaguya's level. In the last arc, they were just fighting against aliens and throwing a bunch of unknown jutsus, making the show like Dragon Ball which really undermined strategy. I have no idea why Kishi had this in mind. I hope it stopped at Madara's level where the fights were still consumable. All in all, I don't find any anime without defects. If Kishi had the second chance to remake this show, I think it'll become unequivocally the greatest anime ever.",9,Recommended,"Jan 21, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1dde28b1ca,22
"This anime is by far my favorite, and I don't think there'll be anything that will surpass it. Though, I will admit it isn't overall perfect, but what anime is. All that matters that in my eyes I believe it to be the best and that's my opinion. Story- 9/10 The story in Shippuden, while not extremely complex like some anime, it still contains underlying tones and messages in its arcs that make you think. It starts off immediately into an entertaining arc that once it starts the series never looks back. There wasn't an arc that I can say I didn't enjoy (excluding filler), some are even my favorite arcs in all of anime, and while they mainly dealt with Naruto and Sasuke, the arcs also gave other characters development and growth that you don't see in a lot of series. The results of each arc are felt and have lasting effects on the characters and me as a viewer. Some arcs made me cry, some cheer, and some even caused me to reflect on life. Character deaths are meaningful and aren't something that are just brushed past, they are talked about and impact the series the rest of the show. The world is expanded upon and so is the lore that makes a somewhat smaller world larger and enhances it in the process. Art- 8.5/10 The animation in this show is its weakest point, but I wouldn't call it a negative. There are moments where you can see the flaws in certain scenes, where characters are making weird faces. Other than that the animation is good and the fight scenes are very well done with the visuals looking extremely good and the characters animated well. The fight scenes especially are amazing, with the attacks looking great, and the choreography of the fights can be among the best. Sound- 10/10 The ost for Shippuden is among the best with emotional scenes being enhances by the background music, the fights feeling more intense because of it, and the comedic scenes better. So, the soundtrack does what it's supposed to do, enhances the overall anime. It is also, so good that I listen to a lot of them in my free time outside of watching the anime. Characters- 10/10 Now we are on the strongest point of Shippuden, the cast of characters. Naruto and Sasuke are my favorite characters in anime, along with a couple of the supporting characters being in my top 20. Naruto and Sasuke are very well layered characters that change with what they experience around them, making them feel very human. Their bond is also something to love because they are the best pair of characters in anime, with how they interact with each other. Then, there's the supporting cast like; Kakashi, Shikamaru, Might Guy, Jiraiya, etc. Most get developed, some more than others, but it helps make you care more about these characters and what they go through in the story. Lastly there's the villains, which are also extremely strong characters, who have their own backstories and reasons for what they do. It makes you understand them, sympathize with them, and even agree with some of the points that they make. So, overall the characters are one of the major reasons that I enjoyed Shippuden. Enjoyment- 10/10 If you couldn't tell based off of what I wrote before this, I enjoy Shippuden to the fullest degree. Enough that I re-watched it twice and still got the same enjoyment out of it that I had the first time I watched it. Overall- 10/10 So, overall I think that this is the best anime out there. Obviously this is my opinion and everyone has a right to their own. However, I request that you give it a chance if you haven't already, and I hope you get the same enjoyment out of it as I did.",10,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4ae4956ac7,22
"I love the Naruto franchise... and Shippuden Just solidified that fact for me!!! Naruto is a challenging exploration of themes such as the cycle of hatred, war, comradery, and peace. Through its expressive and varied cast of characters, it paints a vivid picture of the world in which they inhabit. This rich world is further brought to life by the gorgeous sound design and visuals. Shippuden truly is a sensory treat. And I haven't even started on the characters. Kishimoto works best in creating memorable and fresh character dynamics that keep you drawn to the screen. In particular the dynamic between Naruto and Pain is a masterclass in storytelling, not only being highly enjoyable, but also deeply tying into the show's themes... ...is what I would say if I were a CHUMP!

"I will keep this short: Manga 10/10 Games 10/10 (they are much better then even manga) Anime 4/10 Once again the filler percentage is around 41% with ethe same problems as the Naruto Part 1 anime. Fillers don't give us nothing new to overall story, and exist only to overstretch the anime livespan. When anime adapts the story from the manga it's really perfect, but when the filler arrives it simply downgrades.I did even put a higher score because this show started to adapt some of light novels, but if you're watching this anime weekly it was impossible to tell the difference back then. For the manga it's really a shonen classic at this point of time. The Storm games did even surpass the manga with the showcase of the final bosses fights (Naruto Shippuden opening 8 reference is the best example).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 9, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c82e96b245,22
