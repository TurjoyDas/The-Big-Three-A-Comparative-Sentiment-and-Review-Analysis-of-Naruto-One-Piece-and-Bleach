"There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. ""I don't like the art style"" or ""I've seen the dub - NO THANKS."" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go. As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen. Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at. Now that we've got those two points out of the way... One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him. You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses. The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor. One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA. In a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing. So why should you watch One Piece? Because you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don't at least give it a try.",10,Recommended,"Feb 28, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fe533a003c,1
"Warning: Minor Spoilers If I were to say anything bad (and I will have to do that as this review is not a positive one) about this anime that would not offend the hardcore fans (and I know there are a lot) is that it's PAINFULLY slow. Even if you leave the fillers aside, still- the plot itself progresses in such a slow pace that it's rather hard to watch. Now for a younger audience it may not matter that much, but to me as a higher age audience, it matters greatly, after all, out of the 23~ minutes of each episode 3 are spent on opening and ending (which is usual I guess), but in most episodes, roughly 5 (!) or more minutes are spent on a recap of the current story arc, as if the creators of the show forgot it's a shounen anime and instead got the idea that the audience are elderly people with Alzheimer. But ok, this means there is still 15 minutes left per episode right? Well, not really. In most episodes, the heroes get separated. When they do, the anime tries to keep track of ALL of them simultaneously, cutting every few minutes. This wouldn't be so bad IF after the cut, the same exact scene did not repeat itself (example - a few seconds that show one of the main heroes standing and looking at a place/ villain that is shown from a few angles. Then the anime continues elsewhere, and when it comes back to the same place, the same exact scene is shown). That may not sound as much, but in drastic cases that can sum up to a few minutes (the worst case I bothered to count was almost 4 minutes of time wasted on watching the same scene). Combined with a lot of other tricks, I'd say that a lot of episodes are left with about 11 minutes of actual content on average. That is simply dreadful. Now to say some positive things for contrast- the story is actually very interesting and the characters are well done... BUT, no matter how good something is, if you drag it out too much (and this is indeed the case with One Piece), even the best story in the world and the best characters possible (not to say one piece has neither of those.. The story is great, and the characters are good, but not more) will not keep you entertained, and turn even the best story possible into a boring experience. Now back to the negatives. NO ONE DIES IN THIS ANIME. This is of course an exaggeration, as some people actually do die in this anime BUT only when it's critical to the plot. At all the other times, the characters ""die"" just to add drama and to come back a few scenes later.. Sometimes to ""die"" again and add even more ""drama"" (added """" because at this point its more awkward/silly after one time rather than dramatic). The worst case of this I saw was with Brownbeard who ""died"" something like 5 times over 2-3 episodes (if I remember right), and still stayed alive in the end while the show tried to suck as much drama out of this as possible. And this brings me to the next point- fake drama. They seem to try and squeeze out as much of it as possible, at every opportunity they get. From crying children (and adults) to characters repeatedly ""dying"" and to the most cliche tearjerkers possible at every turn of the story. They even go as far as to try and make the villain's henchmen AND EVEN THE VILLAIN himself have a tragic past that you are supposed to relate to and feel sorry for (because seems a villain can't just be evil because that is just the way he is, he had to become evil because something bad happened (lol, how about sheer ignorance or plain greed for wealth or power?)... and we apparently MUST know. for both villains and side characters that we'll never even see again). Also I mentioned crying.. There is an unbelievable amount of it in this anime. And that would be ok (I guess) if A- they did not try to milk it for drama (yep, that's a word that sure gets a lot of use when discussing this anime huh?) every single time B- they didn't think that when someone cries, he instantly turns ugly, with snot running down his nose and with the worst face expression possible, regardless of gender, age or how emotional he is. I'd say a lot more, but there is already a lot of text, and it's enough to sum it up - this anime is not one I would recommend someone to watch under any normal circumstances (maybe only if someone made a shortened version with all the repeats, openings, endings and cuts removed thus making the whole anime be at around 300 episodes max), I watched over 600 episodes myself, and I can safely say that although some parts were enjoyable, it was mostly rather boring when looked as a whole, and especially the later episodes, and I am regretting the time I spent watching it (as to why i watched it so far- my friend recommended it to me and I did not expect it to last this long. I usually finish what I start, but this is ridiculous, bad, and really beyond me at this point.)",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 3, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8713a59253,1
"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.",10,Recommended,"Sep 12, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33b6ca576d,1
"Review In short, I'm Going to keep it real with you all that you would obviously see my score that i gave One Piece. Well, That is why in my review I'm going to go over these factors as to why this isn't worth your time so that I can save you a life line. So for that You are welcome. (This Applies To Manga Also in case your wandering) Anyway I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching and Investing my time with this and its pretty simple why that is and why It made sense for me to review One Piece. Firstly Its very easy to base this series on the analogy of this being a shonen adventure series yes, however what continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now and to put it simply if I were to sum up this series in a nutshell It would be summed up in 4 words...(Typical Forced Annoying Tendencies) To empathize my point much further, This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where the story is heading now because its writer Oda Eiichiro unfortunately likes to Time waste WAY too often in his writing of milking hundreds of episodes of this series of its so called world building and brain wash a lot of its Japanese audience as well as those that following the whole over saturated popular shonen trend in the process to the point that the fans themselves have overate this anime in general in its own category. Literally the story has not changed to any degree where a new plot can be implemented differently in its approach which sadly isn't the case let alone can the story mature with its premise as this is still following the same freaking formula of a repetitive lame shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most of its episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now so far which I really question if this anime just wants the viewers attention just because of its length that can still be milked because of it? OR does it want to be a pirate adventure shonen that can integrate an effort into its story and characterizations? Well at this point I can easily tell you that both completely Suck at making these traits realized in Oda's craft which is not engaging my viewing of the same formula with many random added coincidences that luffy and strawhats encounter on their journey and with that has lost more credibility in claiming that this is an anime about pirates in general which is even more ridiculous throughout and for the longest time after a while I just found this series to be rather boring and predictable in its long tedious dragged out boring narrative. (Btw, Nothing to do with just its length or its terrible look in general) I honestly got to ask those currently watching or even reading One piece Do you really like to enjoy the same old tropes and jokes over and over again that includes many long pointless plot elements that have many cons for milking their story and character for its own purpose?? Its Just like how the Naruto franchise lost credibility thinking its own series depicts ninjas in its own way to show the struggle taking place for nonjas old and young in its own viewing in the show which shows in both naruto and one piece over time what it has lost through its extended transition in both their writing of these concepts. As a shonen anime Its these glaring flaws that just keeps continuing on and on. That in terms of its story, characterization, progression, writing, enjoyment and any replay value what so ever for a shonen experience which becomes blatantly obvious that it fails! especially when some claim this to be the definitive shonen anime experience of a grand adventure. (Oh Dear.) There are 2 clear things fans will use to defend this show by saying don't be put off by the shows length or its dumb cartoony animation and secondly dont be put off with the handling of the material in the way Toei Animation handles this so instead read the manga, And to that I say.. NONSENSE! Since the show already has a lot problems already that fans seem to gloss over. You see, Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through for what has loads of the same problems as I've mentioned above. If that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up feeling pretty much the same Forced Melodramatic story in its writing that you have seen and heard loads of times and only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even SLOWER pace for this show in each of its build up with each Arc that by over hundreds and hundreds of episodes later by then it totally becomes unacceptable, By then I don't blame certain people out there for skipping chunks of its story now and then. (Trust me, Having tolerance for this anime should be the least of your worries here people.) For me going through each arc to arc in a easy going manner that I approach most anime through my viewing You'd expect that this would be casual thing of ease for me right? No sweat? WRONG, It didn't guarantee me as a viewer any love or charm what so ever to a lot of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series. Instead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most if not all of these characters and YES that does includes the main crew along with their progression except for some few in the straw hat crew that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it? (Some bonding that is if you ask me?, since only a few certain characters with plot armour that can do certain things most others couldn't do) Even when uniting the straw hats together only just makes it for a more cheesier affair most of the time when you would obviously expect it Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does. Which also regards to parts where one piece at some parts wants to go dark its already so desperate to up the ante that a blind Ray Charles can easily tell from miles away that its only going to result into a similar conclusion like before. I mean come on! its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms. One Piece fans try to Over hype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case. A terrible excuse for making points along this series own progression just because its stretched out as it has been for the premise inexcusably which is a joke for those who try to justify this notion. Look, We already got the basic gist of things going on in this series from the beginning, Even through its dumb world building and set up and even till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect. I believe the one piece fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose. 1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far, If you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better. 2. Pointless prologues to your episodes. 3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing. 4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of one piece until HUNDREDS AND I MEAN HUNDREDS of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this. 5. Dumb fanservice depictions of its females making video games like dead or alive and Onechanbara look a lot more tolerable. 6. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned hundreds and hundreds of episodes ago as its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consistency for constantly dragging on in the way it does. 7. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway. 8. Its lame music score that should sound great but it doesn't. 9. Most of the times bad animation no doubt, AKA Toei Animation VERY LAZY INDEED and are swimming in pools of Yen around them like fat sewer Rats. 10. Devil fruits abilities in the way with any other devil fruits that are demonstrated looks stupid and nonsensical to the overall balance and power scaling with variations of different class devil fruit users, which in term of supposedly creating unpredictability and uniqueness to a devil fruit user's abilities only serves to unfortunately create a convoluted mess of an explanation of devil fruit powers in general to those that are Logia, Paramecia and Zoan in their own element even in terms of their weakness which is badly depicted on in the show. 11. Haki creates a lot of bullcrap deus ex machinas later on as an excuse of not explaining a lot about devil fruits all that well and lots of times is used mainly for plot armour for certain characters of the writer's choice which is lazy nor does it add anything new to the battle scaling in fights more like unneeded add ons. 12. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how Oda writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends. With all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about one piece are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way) but those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more. Overall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT PIRATES WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT PIRATES ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS. That is like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOOOOO............. that won't be right, so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes? because you know It sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... WELL WRONG AGAIN. Now going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general. Last but not least The fights really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pacing and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in today. Consider this dropped and good riddance. Excuse me for being honestly critical as I am as I do not sugar coat a series if that is what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving out tens towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome.

"Lets start with the story. Story. 2/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Art. 3/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. Enjoyment. 5/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... overall this series is mostly full of gag you should not take it seriously if you do you're only going to be disappointed so the series isn't the worst series I've ever watch. So if you want a series to laugh at, I would 100% recommend one piece to you all.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 21, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_84fcfc02fe,1
"In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series. And by the way, this review is based upon the original Japanese version. If you have had the bad luck of viewing the 4Kids dubbed version, you have my heartfelt condolences. Right, well, anyway, moving on... PLOT: The story of One Piece mostly consists of the Straw Hat Pirates traveling from island to island and having crazy adventures. Although each crewmember has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: to reach the end of the treacherous Grand Line. Bound by this promise, they pass through unbelievable adventures. Given this pattern, you would think the plot would get boring and predictable, right? Amazingly enough, unlike shonen anime with similar plot devices, One Piece manages to become less and less predictable as its plot advances. As it advances, it also delves into serious situations. There is actually much tragedy involved with One Piece, but the show maintains a balance of comic relief as well. I've actually been driven to tears many times while watching this show, but I've laughed out loud just as many times, if not more. ART: One Piece's art style is one of the elements that turns many people off to the series. The style is fairly old-school, remniscent of 90's shows like Dragonball Z. Then again, I guess One Piece started out in the late 90's, too, so that's to be expected. Either way, the quality of the animation steadily improves as the show moves along. The show is now broadcast in HD, and the quality simply blows me away with every new episode. But the show's animation style remains the same, just greatly improved in terms of quality. After all, with a show as crazy as One Piece, modern animation styles just wouldn't fit. I simply cannot imagine Monkey D. Luffy with eyes like Uzumaki Naruto; it simply does not work. SOUND: I absolutely adore the music of One Piece. There are so many different kinds of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, angry, confused, funny, sleepy, scared, epic, cryptic, foreboding, intense, etcetera, etcetera. For each of these situations, there is a unique musical piece which plays in the background. What's more is that each character has their own style of music and their own theme. Whenever I hear a background song, I immediately know what's going on, and fall into the according state of mind. It happens subconsciously, and it adds to both the predictability and spontaneity of the show. If Zoro's 'epic' music begins to play, he may still lose his current battle. However, whenever I hear that music, I immediately know, ""Zoro is going to dominate in this scene,"" regardless of whether or not he actually does. CHARACTERS: I cannot think of enough synonyms for ""incredible"" to sufficiently describe One Piece's character development, so I'll just say that it's definitely SUPER!!! Ahahaha...yeah, that was a reference to the show...anyway, the characters of One Piece are one of its major selling points. In fact, it was the characters, not the story, that hooked me to this show. Each character has their own personal reason for sailing the Grand Line and for joining the Straw Hat Pirates, and this goal pushes them to new heights with each passing adventure. This goal is backed by an emotionally engrossing backstory which usually can encompass more than two episodes. I have been moved to tears by so many touching flashbacks I no longer possess enough fingers to count them all. The characters are all very personable as well, and are the one aspect of One Piece you can nearly always predict. You always know Luffy will be Luffy, and Usopp will be Usopp. Never would you expect Sanji to suddenly lash out at Nami, but you would certainly expect Nami to lash out at everyone else. Do not misunderstand me; I am not implying that the characters of One Piece are static. They are all decidedly not static. By comparing the current Luffy with the Luffy of the first few episodes, you can discern an obvious difference. The same holds true for all of the crewmembers. Yet the changes take place gradually over time, not all at once. That is my favorite part of this anime. Just like actual humans, the One Piece characters develop new traits and discard old traits, but always remain the same person they were when first introduced. ENJOYMENT: When trying to convince my friends that they should watch One Piece (mostly so I can discuss the latest episodes with them), I inevitably have to ask myself why I personally enjoy the series. And then I am stumped. I mean, I could say all the above and people still wouldn't be satisfied. There would be people asking, ""Well, why do you like that kind of plot? I saw this one show that had a different kind and I liked it."" How am I supposed to respond to that!? That's the equivalent of saying, ""Why do you like chocolate ice cream? I like vanilla, and it's way better."" Whether you enjoy something or not all depends on how your brain is wired and your attitude when you try it. Just because I love One Piece doesn't mean you will, and just because someone hates One Piece doesn't mean I have to. Erm...I kind of got on a rant. Ehehehe...uh, yeah. So, I enjoy One Piece because of the above reasons. Is...that all I'm supposed to put here? It seems inadequate for some reason... OVERALL: In conclusion, I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don't, please don't discount it for any reason until you've actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn't really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable. Oh, and as a matter of precaution, DO NOT WATCH THE 4KIDS DUB! If you do, then you may very well suffer severe damage to your cerebral cortex. If you must watch the show in English, I recommend the FUNimation dub. Their DVDs contain about 13 episodes each, and are available wherever you buy your anime. I forget how much they cost...well, you can Google it if you really want to.",10,Recommended,"May 17, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bd61445051,1
"OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! From a scale of ""over 9000"" to ""too damn high"", how excited am I, you say? Well, judging from watching this garbage, I'd say a 9 will suffice for the after effect. I like it, but in all honesty, it's not good. So, to begin my review, let me start of my experience of watching OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!! Please do understand this is not me taking shots at this series in any way, this is just me expressing my views on the show in terms of its merits and failings to see if its as great as fans really suggest this to be. For a long time you see I've watched the series of One Piece back on television during the great Toonami era which basically is The western TV version of saying HELLO JAPAN!! The dub for 4kids was what I watched at first and no surprise it deserved it at the time, because the show wasn't that special from the get go from when it started off to where it's currently at now with DOH Flippin Flamingo. And yes, I went to Funimation and the Japanese for their take on its characters voice and music etc. which still did not make any difference apart from seeing some dumb unrealistic violence and yet the show still hasn't grown up to where I am now in the series, it could be possibly I'm not acknowledging the show in the right way despite that I'm still watching it or maybe Oda just isn't Goda anymore. OH NOOO! THE HORROR!! The basic story premise is about pirates with super fruity power ups known as Devil Fruits (Laughing excessively here at this point). More to it lies with our main character Monkey D Luffy a wannabe young man who wants to be king of the pirates. (Wow had no idea there was royalty to begin with pirates but oh well) Luffy strings up a group of people to join his pirate crew within different arcs of the story to help in searching for a treasure known as OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! that was foretold by the greatest pirate known as Gold D Rodgers who apparently hides the treasure in the Grand Line (because that's the name of the big game I guess?) and by the time our hair turns grey we might actually find out as to why and what it is (that is either you or Oda stays alive until then.) At the time of Gold D Rodger's death sentence, he makes his last infinite statement that he says he left everything in OnePiIISSWuaaaa! Oh yes! Gotta love that D, eh Boys and Girls? So far in the midst of everything, the story tries its hardest to keep building up and gets messed up at an early point right after 50 episodes which was supposed to be its greatest strength but also becomes its greatest weakness. You probably won't believe me for saying this but that weakness being is WORLD BUILDING. Basically what I mean by that is that it is constantly dragging on episodes to make you feel that you are on a long journey of some sorts but in reality, all it really is doing is STALLING on the part of the mangaka Oda Eiichiro's Art design and writing for whatever wage he seems to be earning on demand at the moment and yes, it's fact since the industry supposedly is hard on the condition of writers on a weekly basis. In other words, the PACING OF THIS ANIME IS AWFUL. Sounds familiar?? It's pretty much very similar to Hunter X Hunter mangaka Togashi Yoshihiro's approach in the story that constitutes for being excessively greedy in its approach, then again quite a lot of Shounen animes are like that, I guess. It's like the anime is holding up a sign saying: HEY NOTICE US PLEASE!! PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF US! OR WE'LL KEEP SLOWING DOWN FOR WE SEEK THE ATTENTION!!!! Anyway, enough of the issue at hand before some of you start feeling like I'm trying too hard to be negative on purpose. Think to yourself THIS, if this was such a great shounen for examples like Death Note or even FMA Brotherhood why the need for SO many episodes?? Why am I so serious..?? Very simple answer. Again it's World building, which demands many SLOW pacing in a lot of episodes, so much so that they probably need LOADS of spin off specials and movies like you haven't watched enough of this already as it is in and outside of this franchise, (also referring to Japanese one piece merchandise of course.) By the time you get your toys at whatever time period this show continues, you ALL would of already grown out of this at some stage in your life unless your an Otaku then fair enough. This is no rant here, I'm only stating the obvious critical point towards the show as a whole. But like I mentioned, it's because of this World Building this leads to the major reason why the story at most becomes tedious and below mediocre at best on a consistent level in almost EVERY Arc. Oh, and also FILLERS! Whether the fandom wants you to know or not know, there are a lot of filler characters which also includes badly forced gags for no progressive purposes except for you to question say ''Hey maybe I should watch something else for the time being,'' and me being an honest critic of this generation I will gladly say this, that you should not be force to be put through too much of the same stuff that you don't really want to SEE in a long series like this. Can we be honest and say for any anime watchers out there that loads of episode can harm World building because of timing and pacing problems such as this? When you are chock full of content like this, it should be constructed and executed better! Never mind the BS on the whole it started in the 90s kinda nonsense. YOU have the content for viewers to be engaged in the show, yet this anime stretches out the same shit you already witness before without some even realising it (Naruto I'm looking at you on this notion here). So, don't go into this series thinking there ain't gonna be any fillers because I can most assure you there are, and quite a lot of them even if some of the extreme fandom don't seem to believe so. The Art is okay and at the same time can look very BAD in terms of the details of a lot of characters. Marines look stupid and quite similar to one another and just well fodder really and females in this series turn out to have the same physique as every other hourglass shaped female in the show. Wait, is this fairy tail?? (Oh boy I might of hit the nail on that one) Big tall men have extremely wide bodies and extremely skinny legs for no reason, at least Whitebeard is the more convincing one out of them. Other characters which includes non human characters look ridiculous and just too nonsensical to be taken seriously, no matter what dragon ball like power they seem to possess. Almost like I'm watching a Disney cartoon back in the day if it was on LSD. Znd for the love of god, why is Usopp's nose like THAT?? I don't care what third dimension of Disney this is supposed to be? THIS does not appeal to me, thank you. Now on to The Power schemes and structures of OnePiIISSWuaaaa! such as: Paramecia: Body manipulation over their own bodies, environment, or produce substances. Logia: Having the power of natural elements or force of nature. Zoan: Transformation of species and inter-species hybrid forms at will. Ah, you would think this category would be solid? While some powers in the series I'll admit can be used to good effect, others can look completely ridiculous and nonsensical even in their own category which for the most part makes the power balance of this series even more unbalanced. Oh and lastly, Haki AKA (Haki of the Color of the Conquering King): Domination of the wills of others is the dumbest made up BULLSHIT! in the entirety of this franchise. ""Oh wow Conquerors Haki! OMG! That guy just looked at another person and that person fell DOWN!! OMG!!"" Seriously? NO SERIOUSLY, don't get me started talking about the different fighting styles in this series, it's lame and not worth mentioning for they are like an excuse for characters that have to fight for the sake of having fights as their only true purpose and nothing more. Villains in this show are typically One dimensional; they the kind of villains that likes to display cruel tendencies to other characters that you really wouldn't care for, BUT I guess because the straw hats appear (Oh Whoopie), you are forced to unfortunately. At times, it can seem somewhat tiresome, especially if you are already familiar with this Shounen pattern again and again and again and AGAIN. How long has this series been going on for? (No Seriously) So, now on to characters where the show for the most part kind of develops, but only due to back stories to further a fully purposed plot for them later on from the get go, but it never really makes ground breaking attempts to carry along in this stride in every arc which is a real shame. So this wouldn't really be shocking up to this point, ESPECIALLY if you have already watched a shit ton of episodes till the current episode you are at right now. Main Characters, The simple short version. Luffy: IMO, as the Lead character he is one of the most uninspiring main character leads I've ever seen in shounen he has 2 fixated moods DUMBASS Or Constipated Raging Man child. Take your pick. Zoro: He is useless following directions making the punt of his efforts in lots of situations where he is lost at every turn very stupidly which in turn leaves his three swords style. But then who cares when you see characters like Killer Bee from naruto who uses his own 8 swords style? So right off the bat, what is so impressive about this 3 swords style? Haki Right? The only answer to just about anything dumb in this show, that's cool, I get it. Sanji: He is basically Brock from pokemon as he is just a generic character who tries to be a hit with the ladies and never gets any including that he is also a chef and STILL never gets ANY WOMAN. Poor bastard. Franky: I guess you can say he is the Cyborg technician of the ship who thinks he is SUPER MANLY but most of the time he is just a complete Super douche mentally and physically speaking. Nami: She is Tragic navigator turned tragic Fan service, which gets dudes thirsting ''Where's that Nami hentai at!!??"" Chopper: I don't want to know any further about this annoying Doctor. Brook: Probably my favourite straw-hat pirate out of them all, but Oda sometimes devalues his character like others. Nico Robin: She is Tomb Raider but with a cool ability, if I might add. And to be fair, I liked the back stories of the characters. However, what I didn't like was over using the same sad theme for each of their themes with streams of over exaggerated tears. (talk about milking moments like these here to give people quickly them feels, which gets old really fast.) As for the sound department, it's lacking but by no means bad, it suits whatever mood you could be feeling in this long ass snail pace of a series. The voice acting quality were few and not so many. Animation wise, it can look really decent when they put there time into it like marineford for example, and a lot of other times can look pretty abysmal most of the time according to Toei Animation. Overall am I enjoying this series? I am trying to, but because of those obvious glaring flaws on the surface still exist just like the treasure OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!! I'll admit I have put this on hold during the arc of Doh Flippin Flamingo because I still intend to finish what I started. Otherwise why go in over 600 episodes deep just to drop it? You see I'm a watcher not a reader of forever long manga, so I intend to keep it that way plus I have no time for comparisons between the anime and manga I have better stuff to do in my long life so I leave you with this. If you want the most silliest longest Shounen adventure ongoing where everything changes with the times except this then by all means give this a shot you might end up loving it, just not in the same way it has been for me. I can be sure I'm probably not the only one.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 24, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1e4ce16e1a,1
"One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own. Luffy ate a Devil's Fruit as a child, more accurately the 'Gomu Gomu' fruit (gomu means 'rubber'), thus his body took on the form of rubber, enabling him to stretch and inflate himself at will - though the downside for anybody who eats a Devil's Fruit is that they can no longer swim: something of a disadvantage for a pirate. Luffy is a bit of of a unique character in all of the anime series I have watched: he's not smart, but he's not stupid. Perhaps 'simple' is the best way of describing him, as he has the same thoughts and ideals no matter what the situation is, sees no reason in pretending to be something he isn't, and often has trouble adjusting his fun-loving character to act appropriately in serious circumstances. Although he is the captain of the Mugiwara Pirates, he is pretty much held in line by the rest of his crew, especially Nami. He does, however, usually get the final word. Luffy's aim is to become Pirate King and to claim the ultimate treasure that the old and greatest Pirate King, Gol D Roger, announced at his execution was at the end of the Grand Line: the most dangerous, treacherous and feared ocean in the world. This treasure, 'One Piece', gives the series its name. It is yet unknown exactly what One Piece is, or what it does. However, with every island of the Grand Line that the crew traverse (the only way to sail the Grand Line being to hop from one island to the next) they are one stop closer to finding Gol D Roger's heritage. The rest of the Mugiwara Crew consists of characters just as well-rounded, though still retaining their individuality. Roronoa Zoro, a green-haired 3-sword-wielding (one in each hand, one in his mouth) bounty hunter who has come to be known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro' (though the name was neither coined nor furthered by the man himself) joins the crew in order to realise his childhood dream of becoming the best swordsman in the world, figuring the Grand Line should bring him a plethora of worthy opponents. Nami, the navigator, is a beautiful yet intelligent orange-haired girl whose dream is to draw a map of the whole world - though her main passion is accumulating vast sums of money, usually via theft. She is generally the brains of the crew, but occasionally needs Luffy to show her that her heart is in the right place. Usopp, a long-nosed man whose penchant for stretching the truth is made evident in pretty much every episode, wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great pirate. Although he's not as strong as other members of the crew and has no specific 'special powers', his quick-thinking and ingenious-yet-comedic inventions have too often been known to save the day. Sanji, self-professed 'Love Cook', is a talented chef from the floating restaurant Baratie, who can cook as well as he can kick - Sanji is generally characterised by his inability to resist stepping in to rescue a beautiful lady, especially Nami (even though she manipulates him simply because she knows she can). Sanji joined the crew after great persuasion in order to find All Blue, the legendary ocean where the four seas meet, and thus fish from all the seas can be found - a gourmet cook's paradise. Tony Tony Chopper is the ship's doctor. Here's where it starts getting a little, well, let's say idiosyncratic. Chopper is a reindeer (not a tanuki, a reindeer!) who ate the 'Hito Hito' Devil's Fruit (hito means 'man'), meaning that he is not only able to talk (to both humans and animals - a skill that comes in very useful), but also walk on his hind legs, and even transform himself from cute to somewhat monstrous forms. Chopper wants to become a great doctor and help people, and eventually, after much persuasion from Luffy, sees piracy as a way to give his wish meaning and direction. An ongoing joke with Chopper is for him to shout &quot;Doctor! We need a doctor!&quot; whenever anybody gets injured, before realising that he's the ship's doctor, and so gets to work. Chopper is a cutesy/comedy character but also gives us plenty of reasons to take him seriously. Finally we have Nico Robin, a woman with a mysterious past, and another with the power of a Devil's Fruit. Robin ate the 'Hana Hana' fruit (hana = 'flower'), and thus is able to grow hands from any surface - an ability which sounds pointless on paper but has saved the Mugiwaras from so much danger over the episodes that it has become almost integral to their survival. Robin is an archaeologist who joined the Mugiwaras at her own behest, as Luffy had saved her life against her will. She spends most of her time reading history books, and someday dreams of finding the 'one true history' of their world by traversing the Grand Line in search of 'lodestones', which have ancient documents inscribed on them. Even at the early stage of introducing Luffy and watching him recruit the first few crewmates, I had fallen in love with this anime series. The first 20 or so episodes are somewhat slow-paced, as well as a little confusing, as the quirky sense of humour that One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda gives the series takes a little getting used to for a gaijin. The other members of the crew don't want to join Luffy's outfit immediately, but Luffy manages to convince them that becoming a pirate with him is the best way to realise their dreams, and also helps them to tie up loose ends in their homeland before setting off under the straw hat-wearing Jolly Roger. It's important to bear in mind that these are not your classic Western, rum-toting, eye patch-wearing, &quot;YAAAAAARRRRR&quot;-shouting pirates, with huge beards, peg legs and hooks for hands. That isn't to say there aren't characters who fall under these categories (except for the &quot;YAAAAARRRR&quot;ing), but One Piece is a world filled with intensely interesting, larger-than-life characters who bring a dimension to the anime you wouldn't have thought possible. The powers of the various enemies of the Mugiwara crew bring an almost rock-paper-scissors element to the show, as the party is often split up into groups who have to survive and meet back up with the others in order to continue their journey, some characters' expertises being more useful against certain enemies than others - although the rubberman never knows when to accept defeat! This anime contains some of the most imaginative and out-of-this-world story arcs I've ever come across in an anime series, especially one that does not take itself too seriously. One arc sees the Mugiwaras sail up into the sky to 'Skypeia', or Sky Island, where they take on an evil God who has the power of lightning. The final 'showdown' battles can span 10 or more episodes and are, for want of a better word, epic. Simply the journey undertaken to get onto the Grand Line itself is a tale worth rewatching for its many highlights, as well as being an introduction that comforts you by subtly indicating that the future escapades of the Mugiwara crew will pique your interests further. The Mugiwaras are to a point misunderstood as pirates - they don't plunder, rape or murder everybody they meet. In most cases, they actually help those they come across, but are still very much wanted by the Marines (the main governing body of the sea), who set huge bounties for Luffy and Zoro in order to garner help from bounty hunters, as well as the many other pirate factions sailing around. The animation sometimes lets the show down slightly - it seems the budget for the animators seems to rise and fall depending on the importance of the arc. Some battles are brilliantly animated, such as the showdown between Luffy and Crocodile, leader of the Shichibukai, but many of the filler arcs look poor in comparison. However, this does not take anything away from the fact that One Piece is a masterpiece, with a quirky Japanese sense of humour and a narrative that can be appreciated by all, but loved only by some. My advice is to give it a try - if you're anything like me it will certainly captivate your interest, and then some. Quick warning: stay WELL away from the 4KIDS English dub. They gutted the show, stripping it of many of its best features, and hired a voice cast that could test the sanity of anybody, be you 3 or 43. The lush orchestral musical score and lively J-pop intro has been replaced by awful faux hip-hop in order to market it to Americans, some of the blood is cut while some remains (this is NOT a gory anime by any stretch of the imagination - blood is used as more of an indicator that a fight has been going on a while), characters are renamed according to whim (Zoro is renamed Zolo, either to escape copyright infringement, give a closer transliteration from katakana, or just as an effort to be utterly, utterly lame), and there are some frankly ridiculous amendments - the one that really sticks out for me is Sanji's cigarette. Sanji likes to smoke, and he always has a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth. In the 4KIDS dub, this cigarette is replaced - in every frame - with a lollipop.

"I haven't written a review in almost a year so i might as well start with this 80% of all user made reviews will be positive no matter what. The best way to evaluate anything is to read the negative reviews as well. This is a good rule to go by for anything (games, movies, appliances, etc) With that being said I'm not giving this series a 10. Quick Review: - Story (4/10) Its an infinite loop story, shounen boy being the greatest in the world and it follows him in all his wacky adventures. - Art (6/10) It is indeed a very well animated series but you can easily see many common ways to for the studio to cut corners. - Sound (8/10) Voice acting is top notch, everyone has a wide range of emotions but some overreact too much in one episode. Whats with all the yelling? - Characters (7/10) You'll either love em or hate them (or both) Regardless you''ll have your share of favorites and luckily you will know all about them. - Enjoyment (8/10) Main story arcs are great but what grinds it to a halt are the long drawn out situations in the vein of the Dragon Ball series. Full Review: I kept getting bugged and bugged about when i was going to pick this show up. Ever since 2004. Fast forward to 2008 and I finally picked up and started watching this show from episode 1. I started watching this show with very limited expectations since everyone keeps hyping the hell out of this show. And to be honest, the best way to watch this show is to have very low expectations. Because as soon as the story arc for obtaining Nami started (eps 031- 044), I definitely fell in love with this series. That story ark had everything a shounen anime should have, comedy, drama, action, and serious business. Basically an edge of your seat roller coaster ride trying to figure out what will happen next. Sadly, the story arc's like this are far and few between. The structuring of most arc's usually focus on one or two of the main characters which is perfect for a long running series like this. Don't get me wrong, alot of the adventures are good clean fun which most will enjoy. It's fine if there's no continuity what so ever and plot holes you can fill a 10 gallon trash bag in. It's all about over the top slapstick adventures and it does that well, even perfectly. So why in the hell did I give the story a score of 4? I could make a 10 page essay if I listed them all but the main issue is its whole premise. It is a LONG RUNNING shounen anime. That means they will do anything and everything to make a story arc as long as possible. A perfect example is that the opening AND closing credits will average between 90 to 150 seconds each, a last episode recap will last around 5 minutes , and a next week preview will last for about a minute. Add all that up and that roughly adds up to ~15 minutes of non essential story telling. FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Granted, new story arcs wont have as much time shaved off to start but the typical formula will repeat itself every time. But even then its like why bother watching last weeks episode if you can almost tell half of last weeks story today? Its an infinite loop that we're doomed to be in. Since they are a long drawn out stories, they also suffer from the Dragon Ball virus. Having a face off between good guys and bad guys for 30+ episodes and essentially 'filling' in the time with flashbacks or side stories really insults the viewers intelligence in my opinion. They even have the gall to replay back story arcs that lasted upwards to 10 episodes and 'rehash' the arc into one or half an episode. I could have easily skipped over 260 episodes if i knew they were going to do that. I know it is to acclimate new young viewers to how their lovable characters came to be, but isnt that what dvd's are for? Or at the very least, don't bother to tie them in to a story arc. One more thing I must mention, try not to think too hard when people look like they're going to die one minute and the next, they're up and jumping around like nothing happens or any inconsistencies like that. It will make your head explode if you do. If you are willing to forgive the aforementioned problems with this show (or any long running shounen anime) I'm sure you will notice they do carve alot of nice stories that you will more than likely enjoy. As the actual stories told in the series just look so much fun. It's like watching Indiana Jones NONSTOP. Although it will take forever for them to tell you a story, you'll either be laughing crying or enjoying the wackiness that is One Piece. The creator did do a wonderful job of making VERY unique and non static characters, although some might appear typical or cookie cutter, they usually do something completely opposite or you will discover things you never thought would happen (inconsistencies aside). On top of that, the voice actors are very memorable and fit their characters awfully well. Although most of them yell more than i would like, the sheer number of cast members is staggering and is hard for me not to be impressed. I agree I am not a fan of a few of the main characters but knowing so much about them (due to side stories) its hard not to cheer for the straw hat crew! This series is far from perfect, but it is very enjoyable. 6.6",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 15, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b37994aa26,1
"Ask any person on the internet what their favourite kind of warrior is and you are bound to get one of these 2 answers. Ninja or Pirate. Now we ALL know Ninja\'s are a plenty in anime. But Pirates? Try finding a anime about that! Eiichiro Oda to the rescue! The legendary Pirate Gol D Roger. Once acquired everything a pirate could. But before he was executed he told people he hid his treasure \&quot;One Piece\&quot; at the end of the Grand Line. This started the great age of pirates! One Piece is set in the time of pirates. Even though there are references to real pirates. Bellamy, Alvida etc, its more of a fantasy world. And what a fantasy world it is! Weird creatures, giant monsters and people with a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; ability. Devil Fruit grants the person who eat it unique abilities such as transforming their body, or giving them special skills. The one consequence is it takes away their ability to swim. One of the people who ate a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; Is the young man Luffy. Blessed with the Gomu Gomu fruit (Rubber) He is a rubber man. and he wants to be the \&quot;Pirate King\&quot; (The person who acquires \&quot;One Piece\&quot;) He and his crew of weird but unique characters set of to the \&quot;Grand Line\&quot; to find One Piece. Eiichiro Oda created some really amazing characters! Rorona Zoro a swordsman who uses 3 swords. Liar Usopp, Navigator and Money maniac Nami, Chef and Love freak Sanji, Reindeer misfit Chopper and more. Even though the characters seem a little bland at first after a few episodes their characters really start to shine. Humour is a really big part of the series. You will constantly laugh your ass off at the weird and just downright funny humour this series has to offer. But its not all comedy. Heck no! Fans of action and drama will also love this series. the fights are simply incredible! with the Devil fruit users being the highlights of the series. But just like that the series can take a much darker turn. And will certainly manage to bring a tear to your eye. (Nami\'s background being one of those times DAMN YOU ARLONG!) But it never turns into a emo fest. Its a pretty long series (counting over 310 episodes) and even though there are some filler arcs.

"Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one. One Piece, well i gotta be honest, I didn't like it at first. I thought that the voices were stupid and that it had really no plot whatsoever. This is all thanks to 4kids making the crappiest dub ever. I stopped watching it after, ep 20 or so, but then i heard to try it again using subs. I thought nah, it might sounds really stupid, but i still tried. After episode 20 or so, I was like &quot;WOW&quot;, this is awesome and from then on i was watching it non stop until episode 280 where i caught up. (yea i watched about 250+ episodes non stop) :D If you plan on watching it, watch it subbed please. Well that's enough of that. Onwards. Story The story is really amazing. At first i didn't find anything entertaining, but I pressed on and continued watching. The plot is really amazing. Its different from what most mangaka does, and that is power. The story is all about achieving your dreams, getting nakama(companions/friends), and overall having a grand adventure. The story is original in a sense that it gives you a feeling of ease and hilarity when reading it. I for one, have always enjoyed a chapter and in each chapter is very powerful and/or funny. Art Well to be honest, I find the art interesting. I mean its cool at times but then in some episodes its really crappy. Thats probably the only thing I dont like. But the fight scenes are amazing. The character design is very interesting and very original. The animation is pretty...crappy at times but that's to be expected in some animes. I mean not all of them would be amazing but there are quite a few that really have good animation. The animation for most fight scenes are really well drawn and intricate. Sound I have only one thought for this. JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS OWN AMERICAN VOICE ACTORS. Seriously, they sound so much better and once you hear them, your instantly hooked to them. 4kids really did the crappiest dubbing ever, and that was mainly why i stopped watching it. Also their gum gum rap( american opening) was so terrible. Thanks to Funimation for at least making an &quot;ok&quot; dub. But subs are still the best. Their voices mesh with the characters personality so much that it's amazing. Character Wow. The characters are really amazing. From the air-head captain to the greedy, money-loving navigator, it really is the most unique anime ever. They are all different characters with all different dreams that power them throughout the show. They all have alot in common, but really the biggest thing they have in common is that they all believe and support their captain, because he has saved them where they needed it the most. Every character in One Piece is different from everyone and they are all entertaining. Every episode is funny and most of the time it is Luffy that makes it funny. Luffy is pretty much the most unique character made. He is a simple minded captain who has no other thought other than one piece, his nakama, and MEAT. Yes meat, he loves meat, but if you watch it you will learn that :p Enjoyment Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fillers are much better than Naruto or Bleach fillers and they are alot more exciting. Again the fight scences are amazing. Every episode you will definitely laugh, because Oda-sensei (the mangaka- the one who made One Piece) is awesome. He is pretty much the most creative mangaka, and the person i definitely want to meet. Overall Overall, I give One Piece a 10/10, well because it is pretty much amazing. The characters are very loveable, especially Luffy. Every episode i laughed, every episode I was always at the edge of my seat. If people tell you that One Piece sucks or that its not all that great, then don't listen! The only bad thing about One Piece is that 4kids made the dub first and then ruined it in America, don't listen and just watch it. Listen to me and not them okay :D",10,Recommended,"Nov 9, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5cb0884ed5,1
"One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why. One Piece reminds me of a line from one of my favorite movies: Shaun of the Dead. Shaun: ""I like having him around, I've known him since primary school, and besides he's a laugh! Pete: ""Ok, I admit on rare occasion he can be funny. Remember when he was up all night drunk playing Tekken 2?"" Shaun: ""Oh yeah (laughs) when was that?"" Pete: ""That was 10 years ago! When the FUCK is he going home!?"" While other shonen series at least try to mature along with their fanbase like Naruto going to Naruto Shipuuden or Dragonball going to DBZ, One Piece is the same goofy, juvenile crap that it was in 1999, right down to the eye raping HORRIBLE art. Another problem is that it tells a continuous story, which makes it difficult for new fans to get into it or get caught up without spending 5 straight months doing nothing but watching One Piece! Pokemon has an excuse for running forever and never evolving (get it?) because new games come out and each season Ash must move to a new region and catch more Pokemon. Most people don't continue to watch Pokemon, so it is constantly getting new fans that are experiencing Pokemon for the first time. Pokemon (insert edition here) is their first Pokemon game and the anime seems fresh and new to them. They haven't seen the original Pokemon series or played the original games and it doesn't matter! Detective Conan has been running for 20 years, but like the Sherlock Holmes short stories it took inspiration from, it is completely episodic with a new mystery each week and only a few established characters. A new audience can jump in anytime and it doesn't matter if you've seen the first 15 seasons. One Piece actually tries to tell a continuous story where it DOES matter what happened in the first 10 seasons. You can't just jump in at episode 600 and expect to really enjoy it and understand it. However, even you get all caught up with the 800 episodes of the Straw Hat Crew, it isn't worth it because the tone, characters, and quality of story telling never matures into anything that someone 16 and up and having half a brain would find amusing! All of this isn't to say that One Piece is a particularly bad anime. I have seen some REALLY bad anime, but One Piece isn't on my list of anime I actually hate. One Piece is an anime that I consider mediocre, insanely overrated, and having run WAY past its time without having the grace or decency to take a bow. It is much like the Simpsons in that last regard. At least one good thing came out of One Piece....None Piece! If you haven't seen One Piece yet, I would recommend skipping this one, but still check out None Piece on Youtube, because it's awesome!",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 4, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a27d78d2fa,1
"Ah, One Piece. The anime adaptation of the best selling manga in the world. I used to like this show when I first started watching it, but sadly I don't feel the same way about it anymore. So One Piece is a battle shounen anime, which follows the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who aspires to be the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, a crew consisting of both men and women, who all play an important role that helps keep the crew going, and they all have their own goals. Luffy is our typical, dumb shounen hero, who is a glutton, grins a lot, and is happy-go-lucky. He is a rubber man, whom can stretch parts of his body, gaining this ability after eating one of these ""Devil Fruits"" when he was younger. The rest of the Strawhat Pirates all have unique personalities, with their own quirks, and you're likely to find a favourite among them. Although, some of them can be annoying sometimes. The art style is something you'll either love or hate. It can be either appealing or unappealing to look at. In my case, I don't have a problem with it, and that there are worse-looking anime than One Piece. It's quite cartoony, and has a distinctive look to it. It's certainly a colourful anime throughout the series, with the exception of Thriller Bark, which is like a halloween-themed arc with dark colours being used instead of the usual bright and vibrant. The designs of the Strawhat Pirates look fine, both pre-timeskip and post-timeskip, but I do prefer Nami's sexier look she gets after the time-skip. But the show also has some of the ugliest-looking supporting characters you will find in an anime. The animation is ass. Not gonna lie. Produced by the infamous Toei Animation, the animation is average and just looks outdated compared to other long-running anime that aired (or is airing) around the same time. It's just disappointing and I know it could look better if another studio had done it, or if Toei put more budget into it like in the films. Along with this, the fights (which are mindless) just look unimpressive and are dull compared to the fights in other battle shounen anime like Naruto and Bleach, and it also uses a lot of still frames. There are also no fluid animation for the most important fights that happen in each arc. It's just the same average animation they use for every episode. They never treat the viewers with flashy animation. Not even in the climax of an arc. Barely any of the fights are memorable, they don't have strategy, and the choreography for the fights just suck. I've never been impressed with a single fight in One Piece. So the only things you can really look forward to are some plot twists. The sound effects are somewhat annoying. I personally hate the sound effect of a heart beating. It sounds gross and it doesn't sound anything like a heartbeat. The music is a mixed bag. It's upbeat most of the times, which goes well with the theme of the show. The first opening sounds amazing, and still is the best opening out of all the openings the show has had, but other openings, like the second one, are just painful to listen to. The main characters have their own theme music, which I always liked the idea of in anime in general, and they fit with the characters. The pacing is fine from episodes 2 to 301 (episode 1 was slow-paced), but it becomes permanently slow-paced starting from episode 302. Most of the filler episodes are surprisingly decent. Though in latter episodes, there are almost no filler episodes to speak of, which results in snail-pacing for the canon episodes. I think the anime should've taken a break for a year or two at that point so the manga chapters could pile up, or they could've made more filler arcs so the canon episodes would have better pacing. There are some things that have always annoyed me while watching this show, other than the fights. There is a lot of crying in it, from both main and supporting characters. Not only that, but they make these ugly, exaggerated expressions on their faces when they cry. It's probably a staple of the show, but it feels like they went way overboard with the tears, and it got irritating the more I watched the show and hear them wailing. They cry so easily. Accompanying this is the constant melodrama. Hate that shit. It tries too hard to make the viewers cry. The characters tend to overreact to danger in an anime where nobody dies in it. Yes. There are a lack of deaths in this anime. Basically, for the most part, nobody dies in this show (outside of flashbacks). Like nobody. In an action show about pirates, where characters have been put into situations which would've resulted in certain death time and time again. This got noticeable the more I watched it, and this may be my biggest gripe with this series. It just feels strange that a show like this to not have any deaths for hundreds of episodes. Like I wasn't expecting any characters to die within the first 100 episodes or anything, but the lack of deaths started bothering me after a while. I also didn't expect any of the main characters to kill people or die themselves (because of plot armour which is reasonable since they are main characters). Although, I remember a moment when Zoro attacked with intention to kill these two bad guys, and was surprised that they lived? Like wtf? He was actually trying to kill them? Okay, so Roronoa Zoro is also known as Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro, which means he has killed people before. But after he debuts, we never see him kill anyone, but he's the only person in Luffy's crew who we know that has killed people before. But damn, does it take a long-ass time for the first actual death to take place in the show. For the first 400 episodes, all the tragic moments are in flashbacks or end up being fake-outs if it's in present time. I don't mind lack of deaths in an action anime that has a realistic setting (Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi, for example, which is more focused on martial arts and delinquents as the bad guys, so you're not expecting anyone to really die in a show like that as there's no intent to kill). But One Piece has a fantasy setting and the villains have intent to kill. And honestly it's unacceptable to me for an action/fantasy anime like this have virtually no deaths. Where's the tension? And it's a shame because there are characters in this show who are irredeemable pieces of shit that need to die, but you know they won't, and that will leave a lot of us unsatisfied. What also irks me are the moments where the show makes it look like somebody has died, but later on you find out that they didn't. In fact, there's a moment in an episode where this specific supporting character should've died because what he was doing meant that he had zero chance of surviving, yet he lived. He was no longer relevant in the story after that moment, so why not kill him off? It is one of the most bullshit moments I've ever seen in an anime, it ruined their sacrifice, and it made the character less memorable and less heroic. The show has more fake-out deaths than actual deaths. After realising how rare deaths are in this show, I just roll my eyes whenever a character, in a non-flashback scene, says that they're going to kill or decapitate another character. We never have to worry about any character because they're just going to be fine in the end every single time. And speaking of flashbacks, why do most of the characters have to have overly tragic backstories? I get it! They had it rough! Stop making me feel sorry for everyone! Another thing is that the villains aren't really memorable. Dragon Ball Z has Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu, and they're more memorable than any villain in One Piece. The villains in One Piece tend to have they're own unique laughs too, but it just sounds silly. I also think that shows like Hunter x Hunter and Yu Yu Hakusho has more interesting villains than One Piece. I also don't really like the humour; it's just childish and involves slapstick and retorting. Things like Zoro getting lost all the time as a running gag. In other words, it's mostly unfunny, at least to me. Humour is subjective after all. And I just don't like the general tone of the series. You often see these minor, nameless characters commentating by screaming their lines to whatever is going on in front of them in a silly way in dramatic moments, and it's pretty annoying. Would've been better if it didn't have that at all. And the anime in general is a bit too goofy at times compared to other battle shounens, even if it is a comedy. I think Fairy Tail does it better when it comes to comedy in a battle shounen. Overall, the main characters are the strongest aspect of One Piece, and is the biggest reason why I try to continue to watch the anime. I admit it's fun to see the Strawhat crew's adventures. It's a pretty silly show, not taking itself seriously at all. I guess people like the show for the worldbuilding too. However, the abundance of melodrama might be a turn-off for some people. The arcs are also formulaic for the most part, so it gets repetitive too. There's 2 retrieval arcs too, meaning Oda recycled something he already did in the story when he decided to do a second retrieval arc. There shouldn't be more than 1 retrieval arc, even if it is a different character they're trying to retrieve! And even if One Piece seems to be largely its own thing with its own original characters, Oda still decided to have a character called Blackbeard (or Marshall D. Teach) in it, and it's obviously based on the real life pirate Blackbeard (real name being Edward Teach), and I am disappointed with Oda for doing that instead of making all the characters fictional. I also think the character Bellamy is based on the real-life pirate Samuel Bellamy, and Kuma Bartholomew is based on the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts. Well, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and like adventure, then consider checking this show out. But if you're looking for a battle shounen with spectacular fights, then I suggest you look elsewhere. The fights in One Piece are crap. Don't listen to anyone that says that the fights in One Piece are ""epic"" or ""fun"" or ""cool as fuck"" because the fights are the complete opposite of those things. They probably never watched Dragon Ball Z or Naruto or Yu Yu Hakusho or newer shows like Jujutsu Kaisen where the fights in those anime are actually good and will give you goosebumps. If someone thinks One Piece fights are better than Naruto's or Jujutsu Kaisen's, then they are a blind fanboy or they must be joking or not being serious. Because I cannot understand how anyone would prefer One Piece's shitty fights over Naruto's jaw-dropping fights. One Piece doesn't have 1 single fight that is good. So I myself grew tired of watching One Piece after the Thriller Bark saga. The show peaks in the Marineford arc, and there's little reason to continue watching this show after the timeskip. In fact, the first arc after the timeskip is one of the worst and most boring arcs I've ever seen, and I just wanted that arc to end as soon as possible. Honestly, I think the early episodes of One Piece, the East Blue Saga, are the best episodes.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 16, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_892c1fe630,1
"The pinnacle of mind-numbing tedium, One Piece proves that just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's good. It's issues are many and numerous, eliminating any chance it had at being the greatest anime of all time. 1. The Pacing: There isn't a single arc that isn't outrageously long. From drawn-out fights to lengthy (and usually dumb) filler scenes, I'd say about 70% of each arc is a waste of time and doesn't need to be there. The longest arc (Wano) is close to 200 episodes, and yes, they spend the entire arc fighting the same guy. 2. Length: It's not just that the show is drawn out, it would still be unbelievably long even if it the arcs weren't stretched to their limit. The anime has been running for over 25 years and the manga will soon reach it's 30th anniversary in 2027. 3. It doesn't have a clear demographic: Sometimes One Piece boasts idiotically cringe-worthy humor that only a child would find funny, but with dark moments, outrageous oversexualization of female characters, and blood, it's clearly not for young kids. But the series is so childish overall that it cannot be considered a show meant for teens. 4. Irritating Characters: All of the characters are either dumb or loud. I don't think there's a single episode that doesn't contain idiotic yelling. Luffy is so stupid and clueless that it's impossible to like him. Would I recommend this? No. Never.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 17, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8fe41ba85c,1
"REVIEW OF ONE OF THE BEST ANIMES (IF NOT THE BEST) EVER !!! //ONE PIECE\\ AFTER 982 EPISODES 2021 -NO SPOILERS INCLUDED- First of all, let's get rid of the most stupid reason that someone says before starting watching One Piece. Not watching because of too many episodes. If you want to watch anime and your only goal is to FINISH it then this anime is not for you. One Piece is made to enjoy its story, not to finish it ASAP. When you start watching it, you will get in love with the story, characters and then you will just go and watch it without stopping. After catching it up you would like there to be more and more episodes and you will never regret watching all 900 episodes. You don't have to finish it in like 5 months, take your time and seat and just watch when you feel like it and how much you want. As more as you are watching, you will get the point of the anime and it will be more and more interesting and enjoyable. As regards the art style, I would like to say that art style is unique, and if you don't like it at first you will get used to it and you will see that it will just make anime better. Every anime has its own art style and that's good that they are different, imagine every anime using the same art style it would be boring. As more as you are watching it, you will just forget about it and will be a normal thing, later with a clean and fresh look will show you the story in a beautiful way! The beginning of One Piece is very interesting. Introducing characters and story is well done. While you are watching you will get easily in love with every member of the crew and also through the story you will learn their past and you will get mindblowed. Every character has its own personality and background that is very well made and perfectly connected with the whole story and is important. One Piece has arcs, in every arc, there will be introduced new characters and every arc has tension and uncertainty. You will just wonder what will happen next and get excited. You will hype every episode and you can't wait for the next one. The feeling that you will be getting through the story and episodes will just overcome you in every way and you are going to feel so good while watching One Piece and while passing through the story with Luffy! Everything that is happening to the characters you will feel in your way and will just get connected to them like that they are someone who is important in your life and who mean a lot to you. They will become your friends and you are going to go with them on unforgettable adventures with a very interesting and unique plot and events. I can't describe how much this MASTERPIECE IS GOOD, words are not enough, you must see it yourself and will thank me later! !!! JUST REMEMBER - ONE PIECE STORY IS UNMATCHED WITH ANY OTHER ANIME !!! !!! One Piece has such a deep story that I haven't seen in any other anime. The whole story is done without mistake, all fights include epic moments that you will enjoy and hype, all EMOTIONAL and UNFORGETTABLE, EXTRAORDINARY moments will pierce through your heart and will stay there forever sealed, also will be giving you goosebumps. !!! Another reason why people won't start watching one piece is because of animation. - First of all, you cant expect old anime(from 1999) to have a good animation at the start. - Anime of 1000 episodes cant have constantly good animation, although the animation DOES get better and better every arc, and currently ONE PIECE has one of the best animations I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life and I am pretty sure that it will get even better without exaggeration. Even If One Piece doesn't have that good animation at the start and pacing later on in the anime due to anime catching up to the manga, TRUST ME, it doesn't matter. The story, world-building, characters are almost PERFECT that you will not even bother with animation and pacing. !!! If you don't want to begin this beautiful adventure because of some people saying that it's too long or that animation is bad, then I am sorry for you, because you don't know what are you missing !!! Once you get into One Piece you will regret that you didn't start it earlier and you will see that these reasons are really stupid. !!! Overall, One Piece is one MASTERPIECE !!! GIVE IT A CHANCE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! I hope you will enjoy this anime as I did! 10/10",10,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3fd7fbe581,1
"I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it. NOTE: This is obviously not a bad-ass/cool-mysterious guy on a seemingly complex mission that is trying to mind-fuck you. This is SHOUNEN. Straight-forward and easy to understand for younger viewers and deep enough for the older. This is business as well as entertainment ei: MAINSTREAM. Sure it has a VERY generic shounen anime base-line but it has a lot more depth to it that only a mature audience can understand. This can't be seen within the first 20 episodes; it's one of those things where you have to grin and bare with. Most likely, your efforts would be worthwhile. I'll just follow the trend and comment on the sections; starting with the weakest qualities. 1. ART: (6/10) This is a HUGE issue and it takes a lot of perseverance and patience to get used to the art style of this anime. It took me about 6 months to get used to it. At first, everyone looked like overly-hyper, 12 year-olds being too loud and just looking at them made me want to stop. Noodle-like arms and legs, weird anatomy etc. the list goes on. But if you power through however long it takes for you to get used to the art, the characters appear as catalysts of nothing but pure emotion. This puts you in a weird, neutral position. You know that the art isn't great but you can't seem to imagine this series in any other way. Changing the art style becomes a bad idea. The only reason why I'm giving the art style a 6/10 is because it's so damn hard to swallow. In the end, anime isn't just eye-candy, it's storytelling first and foremost and I think One Piece knows this very well. 2. SOUND: (8/10) The sound in this series isn't bad but it isn't spectacular though it does have golden moments during heavily emotional scenes. What IS fantastic is the seiyuu's performances throughout this colossal series. They (generally) capture the essence of their characters, flaws and all. For example: The annoying idiot aspects of Luffy. Mayumi Tanaka was THE voice for Luffy. No one could fill her shoes. The opening themes usually sets the correct tone for the series; an up-beat, ""let's go on an adventure"" kind of feeling. Corny? Maybe, Childish? Very, Effective? Absolutely. For what One Piece is and what it does; the sounds in the series definitely supports. It's doesn't suit my taste in music but it's very ""One Piece"", which adds to the experience. 3. STORY: (10/10) The depth of this story will surprise anyone. I had very low expectations for this series, having started years after it began airing but after watching it for a while, I truly believe that this is one of the best shounen stories to date. Despite being from a very obvious shounen base-line, One Piece delivers fantastically. One Piece explores society in a very extreme manner; often exaggerated to enhance the hype of the moment. You can see that this is deliberate because of how everything within the story drives to one particular moment. I don't think One Piece's story should be compared to reality because it's simply not realistic: It's not supposed to be but we can certainly compare and relate the ideas and themes within the plot. This is a truly well thought-out plot, beautifully integrated with the characters to provide a very wholesome experience. If you sit there and watch it -searching for flaws- you will be missing the point of One Piece. If you approach it with a ""What the hell but whatever, lets see how this goes"" attitude, you are guaranteed to enjoy this plot more. NOTE: Fillers are NOT stories, they fill empty spaces. That's why they're called 'fillers'. They are meant to be half-assed to buy time for the author. You can't judge a series by fillers, that just means you're stupid. 4. CHARACTER: (10/10) First impressions are important when it comes to characters. Unfortunately, One Piece fails at this and fails pretty hard. We are introduced to a very typical hero, off to be some king of something and be the biggest, baddest man on town: in this case, the world. Then we meet a typical tough-guy/Mr. Cool. etc. The thing that is amazing about the characters in One Piece is that though they appear very standard; they somehow manage to break their cookie-cutter mold. Each character basically has one strong quality about them but that one aspect of their character is what makes each character special. They then develop as the story progresses; being faced with challenges each character's physical, mental and emotional state to their limits; tests their judgment and instincts. They are never perfect but it's how they work around their shortcomings and utilize their few strong aspects to survive in the hostile world of One Piece, that puts the characters of One Piece in a league of their own. Once you get used to the whole atmosphere of this series, you will find that you won't be able to help but feel very attached to almost every character you come across. 5. ENJOYMENT: (10/10) It's fabulous. I can't think of any other series with this much depth; in character design and the execution of the plot. There is a lot to read into in this series, people just need to take a deep breathe and allow themselves to be drowned and suffocated by it. It won't kill you I promise. 6. OVERALL: (10/10) I obviously love this series. It's completely underrated and is constantly being flamed by 'mature viewers' that think they've actually grown up just because they watch brain-raping anime with what SEEMS like a complicated plot when it's actually just another generic anime to their related genre. This series deserves a lot more than that. It is worth the trouble of getting used to the painful art style. It is worth credit. There IS a reason why it's popular. We, in the Western world tend to think that it's mind-boggling to see that THIS is one of their most popular animes but I think it's our arrogance and denial that is causing this negative reaction. Apparently, anime is just pretty colors, characters with big eyes and crazy hair, and big tits or a scifi-novel with moving pictures. One Piece is a fantastic combination of business, entertainment and art. It's obvious why this series is such a success in it's homeland. It's just tragic how a disgrace to mankind (4Kids Entertainment) got hold of this gem before it could reach a wider audience. This is not a masterpiece; but it's pretty damn close to being one. There is no such thing as a perfect show.",10,Recommended,"Jul 3, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a7f099d3bd,1
"Yes, you can believe your eyes, I really rated One Piece a 6. But please! Wait before spamming the 'Not Helpful' Button. I'm myself a fan of Shonen Anime, so I should happen to like One Piece, right? Right?! Nope, not really. But let's delve a bit deeper. Story: 6/10 The definitely most promising about One Piece is its absolutely unique setting. The sheer vastness of the world makes this anime outstanding. And even better, in that kind of setting nearly everything can happen. Adventures on the ship, tropical islands, deserts, or some snowy winter paradise. However, despite this promising world, each and every damn arc is exactly the same, over and over again!! Our crew gets to island XYZ. Some evil enemy appears and beats up everyone. I mean, look how scary this boss is (more to said boss in character by the way). After being beaten up however, the Nakama get a powerup, and defeat the boss. Repeat. And again. Aaand again. Art: 6/10 I won't mention something about the unique Art-Style. Everyone has read up on that one already. Some might like the cartoonisch, and also childish, artworks. I don't BUT I wouldn't cut 4 points for such a reason. So what about those 4 points? Battleanimations. This single word is enough. One Piece has one of the lousiest animations in terms of battle of all time. Repeating scenes, classic cut scenes, everything. Just in the last fight I watched Zoro had a fight, where he parried an attack with his three swords. They change the camera angle, and suddenly Zoro holds only two of his three swords, with the last one being in his Saya. And the sad thing is, this isn't every once in the while, those mistakes are common occurences. Sound: 8/10 First of all, the OST/Backgroundmusic. Even though some OSTs were misplaced, the most of the OSTs are pretty good and fit the desired atmosphere. Second, the Voice acting: I won't hide the fact, that I like Zoros seiyu Nakai Kazuya. Ever since his first appearence in Gintama, he has been one of my favorites. The other voice actors did their share of work as well, I especially like Luffys, Namis and Choppers voices. Last, but not least, the opening and ending section: I'll start with this. Later on, the openings get far too long with 2:30 each. Stick to the common 1:30 damnit! Well, whatever. Most of the openings and endings blend in really well with the overall tune of the show. I don't really like the openings and endings, but they fit, which is the most important point. Character: 7/10 Can't really say, that I really like any of the characters (besides Zoro and Nami, but thats just personal oppinion) but they have their reasons of existence. Way worse than the main crew are the completely forgettable enemies. They have puny reasons for being evil, are completely incompetent, and worst of all, some of them even turn face (wrestlingterm: becoming one of the good guys) after being defeated. Enjoyment: 5/10 What can I say? Some of the jokes were okay, but serious matters are painfully dump to watch, because the series is just completely unable to stay serious. Also, for a battleshonen, the battles are awfully bad. Well, at least I'm able to crack a wry smile. Every once in a while that is. Overall: 6/10 Many think of One Piece as one of the Big Three Battle Shonen, together with Naruto and Bleach. Since I haven't seen Bleach yet, I won't compare those two, but there is no problem with comparing it to Naruto, right? Overall, Naruto wins by a large margin. Its battles are better, the soundtrack is better, the art is more detailed, the series can stay more serious, and whats most important to me: The whole skill system is more complex, but also way superior to One Pieces Devils Fruits etc. An example as ending? Okay: Why for example do Devils Fruits Users not loose their powers in rain? Due to Oda because its moving water. But at the same time they loose their powers in rivers. And strictly speaking: Oceans are moving waters as well. The only unmoving water I can think of are swamps.

"One Piece is honestly the most amazing series I have ever watched or read. The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest. The characters are some of the most endearing, well-developed and likable characters and the art, while not appealing to me at first, took a grand total of TWO episodes to get used to before I found it to be incredibly unique and my favorite anime art style to date. While this series has serious moments, it never stops being funny. Something important about the humor in this series is that it's ORIGINAL. None of the typical jokes that are recycled in every anime and even the serious moments I was talking about are sprinkled with clever and endearing humor that keeps me watching. Something that is important to me in a series is the characters. If I don't like characters, chances are, I'm not going to like the series. The lead cast to One Piece has won me over in their own individual ways. There is not a single one I don't like and I seriously thought that was IMPOSSIBLE.

"''I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become The Pirate King'' This is the quote, that sets the main plotline for the series. Along with the name of the title itself. Hearing this and glimpsing at the synopsis, I build up expectations of an amazing journey, coupled with an engaging story driven narrative and good sense of mystery. Unfortunately those expectations were not met with great content to satisfy them. My main motivations for starting this was my desire to understand why is this series so successful in Japan. And I'm afraid to say after I gave the show a shot, I wasn't able to get it, or even see the appeal like I would for others shows that I didn't like. Let's start with the Characters [3/10]. They might be one of my biggest gripe of the show. I could forgive the semi-episodic narrative of the show and the repetition found in the format of the arcs if the characters kept my interest and made me want to keep watching. It's not that I simply didn't like them, because Luffy the protagonist himself is pretty likeable, and I like Zoro and Robin. But characterization, progression and just the general writing of the characters fails to deliver. Luffy is two dimensional at best. Everything about him feels borrowed from Goku, and not much is exclusive to him. He doesn't have any significant character development for more than 100+ episodes. He has the same track mind, same point of view. Never changing or maturing. Not feeling any more sense of responsibility and not gasping a bigger sense of the world, emphasizing his naivety and immature personality. So he is a static character for a big portion of the show. While static doesn't mean a bad character by default, in the case of Luffy it makes him a bad character. It makes him super predictable in how he reacts to things, his interactions with others and his decisions in general. There is hardly any fleshing out of his character outside of simple dialogue and simple motives ''I want to be the pirate king'' '' I Will Protect my Nakama'' ''I love meat''. His characterization is very simple and while that could be considered likeable, it's yet not charming as Goku. Since it's just a copy. I just find him dull and non-simulating, the shouting and care free personality with the serious personality in fights doesn't make him interesting to me. There is just no particular depth in his characterization or the execution of his character. He is faced with a major life changing events later on in the series, but he is still the same character after it passes. When speaking of development, it's not meant to be a complete change of personality (180 personality change) but it means a significant change in characterization, while his fundamental character is still intact. A dynamic character most often than not is more interesting with more room to show more layers of the character. The other main characters more or less are the same as Luffy just slightly better. I found Nami's character to be good due to her conflict with pirates and her character development and back story in Arlong park. I thought that was a not so average aspect like most other things, and I even started liking her. But as soon as that arc finished she remains static with nothing to offer, making her interactions with the crew members predictable, annoying and hardly funny. I expected to see more to her than simple gags. They don't get development past their introductory arcs. Which makes them less believable and interesting, considering they are on a big journey that should alter their lives forever. Repeating of their dreams and motives every other time kinda makes them shallow, because they offer nothing else in conflicts, internal struggles or different dimensions or something subtle to make me wonder and try to think and understand something deeper or anything interesting really. They remain in a status quo for a very long time. The author just doesn't try and bring fourth interesting conflicts for them to develop alongside the story. It's like after he is done with their basic and initial characterization he just stops there. So they feel like very incomplete characters that have unharvested potential despite the length of the series. I really dislike Sanji. He is the worst crew member. No. He is the worst character in the entire show. No. He is the worst character I've ever seen in any shounen anime. There is bad, and there is offensively bad. Sanji belongs to the latter. His characterization, I don't exactly get what the author wanted here. Did he really want him to be a celebration of sexism? it's supposed to be chivalry but it goes beyond that, and enters the realm of sexism with Sanji. When he refuses to fights female characters even if the lives of his crew members depends on it. He is not supposed to be a comic relief character, so this isn't an excuse to how his character is written and presented. I don't see him as a classy womanizer, I see him as an offensive character who's love for women shouldn't be more than a comedic side to him. It shouldn't be a big part of his characterization. It came to the point where his comedic nose bleed became an actual plot point, I shit you not. It's like everything about him aside form his initial dream (that is never brought up as an actual point of relevance after his arc) is about women. And that's why he is that much worse than the other characters in the show. There is nothing redeeming about him (even his style of fighting is bleh) The story [5/10]. I didn't see something particular impressive about it. There are certain problems that is apparent in almost every arc. They are formulaic for the most part. The crew goes from an island to an island helping the inhabitants of said islands, and go on about their way. It feels like every arc is episodic and discontinued, with little things barely connecting them together to an overarching story. I didn't like that since I like continuity and for a premise such as this, I was more in favor of non-episodic storytelling. As it feels like padding, since you get introduced to a lot of characters that are in the end not important or even relevant outside of their perspective arc for the story or the main characters. Once in a while one of those characters make a surprise appearance and the fans get excited, feels a bit like tricking them from my point of view, especially with the characters that are supposed to be dead but are never shown exactly their death. The type of stories in each of these arc is more or less fundamentally the same. An evil oppressor (Arlong, Crocodile) does his evil ways in the island and controls it for his own objectives. The heroes (strawhat crews) became friendly and bond with the villagers, so they are asked to help them. Luffy takes on the big bad and the others take care of the henchmen. This type of scenario gets boring pretty fast. Especially when it in itself, without the repetition is dreadful and the bare bones of a hero vs villain narrative. In Alabasta, it almost feels like a Disney story, with the person asking for help being a princess. Villains in the series in general are evilly cartoon-ish. Another issue is the plot armor, and how almost nobody dies. 700 episodes and the death of important characters can be counted in one hand. Nothing wrong with keeping it light, but if that's the the intention then the characters shouldn't be facing that many near death experience and surviving through cartoon logic. It will really test your suspension of disbelief. Luffy for whatever reason almost always has to take the big bad of any arc, which adds to the formulaic nature of the arcs. There no logic behind it aside from Luffy being the protagonist. This negates the potential for more interesting conflicts or the chance for other crew members to get a bigger spotlight. Zoro's spotlight in Thriller Part is a fine example of how Luffy not hogging the spotlight for once was incredibly refreshing and most importantly great on it's own. The pacing [2/10]. This in particular is one of the biggest issues in the series. That overwhelming amount of episodes isn't like that just because of the great mass of content alone, but the almost snail pacing contributes to that greatly. Toei is the animation studio in charge of this adaption. It became infamous for this type of pacing and production. Intro in the beginning of each episode, recaps, a lot of paused shots, and overall just the mind numbing feeling that nothing of interest is happening for several minutes of an episode. This is definitely the biggest hindrance of enjoyment in the show, at least for me. But it's not all Toei's fault. The original source material also has a slow progression of events. Along with Toei's treatment, this makes for an unsatisfying watching experience. Which is one of the main reasons if not the biggest reason why I dropped the series above all else. Take in mind, that this isn't to say slow pacing is inherently bad, it actually can enhance the experience of certain works. But One Piece is definitely not one of those works. A balance would have been ideal, even if I have preferences for fast pacing in action shows. It's currently according to a lot of people unbearable, so it only gets worse. The action component of the series is, in my opinion just awful [3/10]. I personally consider the fights in One Piece to be the worst I've seen in any action shounen I've watched. Be it in terms of creativity, strategy, abilities/powers, excitement or animation. The abilities/powers are silly, while that works with the general style of the show, its still lacks creativity, as they feel like they are created by a child. A rubber man. Someone that can make anything into a door. Feet that generate fire from the passion of the heart, etc. I will get to the animation in it's own paragraph. The fights are sometimes really dumb, and are mostly devoid of strategy. The best you can get in terms of strategy, is juvenile tricks by Ussopp, and the silly 'tactics' Luffy comes up with, that shouldn't work but they do because of Luck or/and the incompetence of the villains (the classic trite of you are beneath me so I didn't take you seriously and was careless) . Shouting and straight forward predictable fighting, is what you will get. The tension created by how is this character going to best this character is simply not there. When Zoro gets beaten up badly by someone made of steel, but suddenly has the resolve and wants to believe he can cut steel, and he just does with no good explanations, you will know that you shouldn't expected anything smart out of the fights. In fact some are offensively dumb, Bon clay vs Sanji comes to mind. There is also how the comedy is inserted in some fights or certain scenes. I realize that show has a lot of comedy, and it's a prominent genre, but that doesn't mean it should be inserted whatever. With disregard of the current tone and atmosphere of the scene, a particular scene in thriller park had that. It undermines the importance of the fights sometimes and the mood that is being set, and it in itself is rarely funny. The humor in general is not great. As it's very repetitive and most often dry. How many times until Nami, yelling at the crew and showing her greed becomes just plain unfunny. Though maybe if you really like any particular gag, you will still like seeing it again and again (Zoro's bad sense of direction for example). So it depends on the individual's sense of humor. It wasn't until Alabasta that I found an episode to have legitimately funny scenes, so I came across more misses than hits. The Art and Animation, and OST [5/10]. I will be frank, I didn't really take much notice to the soundtrack so I can't comment on it. The artstyle of the series is often described as ''ugly'' by those who refuse or avoid to watch it. And I can't say that I blame them. Is the art different compared to similar shows? Yes. Does that automatically makes it better or good? not necessarily. The art is influenced by western cartoons and Disney. And it's fair point for those that think it's works well with the series, and I agree to a certain extent. But that still doesn't mean me or others will like it, as it's still very unappealing. It also has an apparent effect on the emotional scenes in the show. The facial expressions are so exaggerated that it disengaged me from whatever emotional scene I was watching. With big rainy eyes, and noses full of snot. It completely lacks subtlety. Bigger doesn't always mean better. It comes off as the show trying hard to emphasize just how sad what you are watching is. It can be ineffective and worse, counterproductive, when instead of feeling sorry and emotionally involved you feel like laughing because of the ridiculous faces. While I understand this is a long running anime therefore expecting fluid animation is unfair. It still should mean that at least once in a while you will be presented with good to great animation in important scenes and fights. Like with other long running battle anime. This unfortunately is not the case here. At times it feels like a slideshow. Barely any nice visual effects. Lot of pauses and staring. Still shots. No good Sakuga. And it only gets worse currently according to the fans. The Worldbuilding [5/10]. I left this at the last, because from my general understanding this is the most praised thing about the show. But why? from my point of view, there is nothing impressive about a city in the dessert or an island in the clouds/sky. Once again the creativity of the author seems child like. But maybe that's the appeal. The feeling of freedom, and childish imaginative without the shackles of reality. But it still doesn't necessarily make it great. It feels like it's praised because he created a vast world that is still expanding because why wouldn't he expand it, when the estimation for the number of chapters is beyond 1000. But then again, worldbuilding wasn't something that I cared for in general, in my favorite shows, or any work of fiction for that matter. I could appreciate well done aesthetics of a beautiful world, that you like to take a mental picture of. That's not the case here, so I can't really credit it. Ultimately, I truly and honestly wanted to like this. So the gigantic amount of episodes/chapters would become an advantage. I wanted to be immersed in a story and keep following it for years. But the series failed me, after giving it a fair enough chance. I stomached through the beginning since they said Arlong park where it will get good. I endured after that, when they said Skypiea is fun and worth it. I couldn't keep on hoping, when they said it's Water 7 this time, more than 200 episodes. I just gave up. There wasn't any pay off. Everything was standard average to below average, with few exceptions. Not special or distinctive to dislike or for this to become more than a disappointment. My enjoyment being hindered with the pacing, and lack of stimulating characters, I made the natural choice of dropping it. I just couldn't take another minute felt like I will just die from boredom. TL:DR- If you are hesitant whether or not to make this big time commitment, you should keep in mind that it's generally agreed upon by fans and haters alike that it doesn't get better until Arlong park, which more than 30 episodes into the anime. I would recommend this, if you are looking for a happy go lucky battle shounen, that has a lot of focus on the adventure. I don't recommend this, if you are looking for a continuous narrative of a complex story about finding a treasure, with interesting unique characters. Nothing of value is lost, or something worth the commitment if you are avoiding this.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 24, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b15ebbbb85,1
"You know what I really miss? The good ol' days of shonen anime/manga where something could have an outrageously bizarre concept with an equally bizarre universe which can be light in tone and set the stage for some grand adventures to unfold. Nowadays, it seems like most shonen anime and manga try to be all dark and edgy in order to defy those sort of preconceived notions that all shonen anime and manga is light-hearted and/or childish. While that's all fine and dandy, I can't help but feel that we're losing something special in the process of this sort of transition from light-hearted adventures to dark and grim tales of survival. With the cancellation of the Hunter x Hunter anime (further compounded by the manga's hiatus), it seems like brutal survival games chock full of fan service and outrageously violent battles are all that's left of shonen series. Then enters One Piece: one of the most popular shonen anime/manga series out there which is still going strong despite being around for 15-something years. It's had a lot of ups, downs, and more than its fair share of criticism levied against it but all things considered... it's something like a breath of fresh air in this stale climate that shonen anime/manga seems to have immersed itself in as of late. ***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING*** One Piece takes place in a world completely dominated by maritime travel that's currently experiencing something known as the ""Golden Age of Pirates."" The ""Golden Age"" was brought about by the death of the so-called Pirate King, Gold Roger and his final words about where he's put his entire life's fortune. Whosoever finds Gold Roger's treasure, the eponymous ""One Piece"" will then become king of the pirates (or so the legend goes; I question how finding a dead man's riches will automatically make you king of all maritime bandits, but that's beside the point). While many people might dismiss this concept as childish, this is one of the very things I love the most about One Piece. You want to know why? The reason why is that despite the simple set-up would seemingly get repetitive over a short span of time, Eiichiro Oda steps up to the plate and manages to deliver plenty of adventures that are so grand in scope that you'll have a hard time trying to keep your jaw attached to your face. The way that Oda manages to so is quite clever and something that I never really get tired of: the fact that the Grand Line (the place where the vast majority of One Piece takes place in) is pretty much a perfect canvas to unleash his creative mind. The Grand Line is literally a place where common sense won't get you anywhere. Conventional means of navigation are impossible because each island emits its own, strong magnetic field that interferes with regular compasses. Instead, you need a special compass called a ""log pose"" which basically leads you to the next island and that island is completely random. In addition to that, it takes a certain amount of time for the log pose to reset itself and lead you to the next island. The log pose can change at a moment's notice, so you can't even trust the calm of the seas or the weather. On that note, weather in the Grand Line is incredibly chaotic due to the irregular magnetic field that encompasses the entire area. On the topic of weather, every island in the Grand Line has its own climate, fauna, and such. Some islands are cloaked in perpetual winter while other islands are quite literally stuck in prehistoric times with dinosaurs and everything. Going back to the log pose, sometimes it can point you to seemingly impossible locations. Would you believe that there's an entire arc in One Piece that takes place on an island IN THE FUCKING SKY?!?! I'm not even kidding. Whenever Eiichiro Oda puts his mind to it, he really can surprise you with what he can come up with. In fact, when it comes down to the world-building, only Fullmetal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter come close to matching it. Of course, One Piece and HxH opt for a sort of ""make it up as you go along"" approach while Fullmetal Alchemist is more carefully crafted. A rather important part of One Piece's universe is the existence of the so-called ""Devil Fruits."" Whosoever devours one of these strange fruits will be given great power at the expense of their ability to swim. It should be noted that throughout the entirety of One Piece (thus far), there is absolutely NO explanation behind the mechanics of Devil Fruits and their effects on humans. Some people will undoubtedly take umbrage with this, but I don't. One of the things that irritate me the most when it comes down to shonen anime and manga in recent years is the fact that there's always NEEDS to be an explanation to EVERY SINGLE THING. Don't get me wrong, there's always going to be shit that will need explaining, but I find it infuriating whenever there has to be some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation given for practically EVERYTHING that happens to our characters whenever they gain/use a superpower. In One Piece, the Devil Fruit superpowers are indeed important but they're not the overall focus of the plot. I suppose you can consider the Devil Fruit powers to be analogous to Nen from Hunter x Hunter or chakra from Naruto if you need something you can compare it to (even then, it's not quite like those two). Another thing to note is that no two Devil Fruits will bestow the exact same power. ***THE STORY*** One of the biggest problems that the One Piece anime suffers from is a VERY slow start. Like most shonen series, the story of One Piece is told arcs. The first 61 or so episodes encompass what I like to call the ""East Blue"" arc (which comprises of several smaller sub-arcs). Basically, it's where Luffy is recruiting his crew and the various adventures that follow suit. By the end of Episode 31, the final crew member joins and the team is ready to set sail to the Grand Line... although that's not quite the case. After Sanji joins the team, Nami briefly defects as we go into an arc that dives into her own back-story before she returns and becomes a permanent fixture of the Straw Hat pirates. It's not that these episodes are bad or anything, but I just got done telling you all this amazing shit that happens in the previous section and yet none of that shit actually goes down until AFTER these episodes. Well... to be fair, these episodes were produced well over a decade ago when the manga itself was still rather young. I suppose it's like Phantom Blood from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the sense that it at least provides us with the foundation for these grand adventures to unfold. At the same time, I can't help but feel like Toei Animation could've at least skipped over some of the more superfluous stuff from the manga. Whatever, it's too late to do anything about that now. Aside from that, the story of One Piece is pretty damn good. For a series that's been going on for well over 15 years, it's surprising as to how consistent the overall story quality remains across the board. Yes, there are points where the storytelling takes a downturn, but this generally happens in filler arcs and whenever there's some excruciating padding in an episode to stretch out the chapters (more in the next section). Of course, there are also moments whenever you can tell that Oda didn't quite bring his A-game to the table in a particular arc. Yes, a man like Eiichiro Oda can also suffer from dry spells where his storytelling isn't quite up-to-par with what he usually brings to the table. He IS human, after all. Considering that One Piece is a shonen series, it's no surprise that themes of friendship and loyalty are quite prominent. What's more is that in a vein similar to ""classic"" shonen series like Dragon Ball, it's going to be a tale of adventure that is rather light in tone (for the most part). Does this mean that One Piece is automatically childish garbage? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Surprisingly enough, One Piece is fairly capable of taking itself seriously when the time comes for it to do so and what's more is that friendship/loyalty will ALWAYS be themes no matter what since those are hallmarks of the genre. No sense in complaining about something that's part of the course, you know... The overall arc structure of One Piece is fairly predictable, but that's not an inherently bad thing since it does offer a degree of consistency with the storytelling. The basic formula generally goes like this: the Straw Hats land on an island -> residents of the island hate them -> the Straw Hats meet the island's bad guy(s) -> they beat the bad guys -> residents of the island now love the Straw Hats. Keep in mind that this is simply the framework for an arc and the way an arc actually plays out may very well end up surprising you. This goes back to One Piece's greatest strength: giving us amazing adventures that are so grand in scope to the point where you can't look away from the screen for a moment. ***THE FILLER*** Surprisingly enough, Toei Animation did a relatively good job of remaining filler-free in a series as long as One Piece (roughly 98 episodes). It also helps that most of the filler arcs tend to be rather short (typically 2-5 episodes) across 670 episodes. It also helps that a good portion of them basically got their origins from ideas that Eiichiro Oda wanted to put in the manga but couldn't for various reasons. But does that mean they're worth watching? Well... I suppose you can go ahead and sit through the filler but the G8, Ice Hunter, and Ocean's Dream arcs are the only ones that I consider worth watching since the other filler arcs tend to be more hit/miss. Going back to how Toei Animation mostly managed to subvert filler, it was through adaptation expansion. Eiichiro Oda is a guy who packs quite a lot of detail into his stories, so it's easy for writers to expand upon concepts he brought up but didn't quite flesh out. Unfortunately, Toei Animation has this nasty habit of taking things too far. While the adaptation expansion was good enough that occasionally bordered on great in the first half of the anime, the latter half of the series (Episode 405-onward) is where Toei Animation's adaptation expansion takes a downward turn for the worse. After the Sabaody arc, Toei Animation decided to up and scrap the idea for filler episodes entirely and instead adapt the chapters at a 1:1 ratio. Considering the fact that not every chapter will have ~20 minutes' worth of stuff to adapt, Toei Animation had to improvise and they did so by means of VERY excruciating padding. It REALLY got ridiculous in the Marineford arc where you're basically panning over shots of the crew and have to put up with Buggy's pitiful attempts at comedy. It even got to a point where they showed one character looking for milk before going back to a fight. Now with that said, it DOES get better and it's really noticeable after the time skip but it's too little, too late by that point since the time skip is fairly recent (around episode 515?). ***THE CHARACTERS*** Considering the fact that One Piece has been going on for 15+ years, it's no surprise that there would be a LOT of characters. A good deal of them show up later on in the show/manga's run, but the vast majority of them are more or less just there for one arc before the focus of the story shifts to the next arc. Surprisingly enough though, even characters that have been around for just one arc were fairly well-developed and rather likeable like Dr. Kureha whose only appearance is in the Drum Island arc. There are certain characters who stick around with the Straw Hats for more than one arc (i.e. Vivi), but they're few and far between. Despite that, they receive more than enough screen time to the point where you feel like something's missing once the time comes for them to depart. For the vast majority of One Piece, we're stuck with the Straw Hat pirates: a rag-tag bunch of misfits with their own share of issues that also have such large bounties on their heads that rival Vash the Stampede's. The leader of the Straw Hats is none other than the rubbery Monkey D. Luffy. For lack of better words, Luffy is well... an idiot. What's more is that he's a gluttonous idiot in a vein similar to Goku or Naruto but thankfully he's not THAT extreme. A good benchmark as to how much you'll like Luffy is how well you can tolerate his airhead behaviour since it does get rather ridiculous at times. Regardless, he's got quite a few good traits to back him up and without Luffy, there would be no adventure, which would fucking SUCK. My favourite character would definitely have to be a tie between Roronoa Zoro (the swordsman) and Sanji (the chef). Why? Well... it's a combination of cool factor AND the fact that they play off of each other (and Luffy) rather well. I just can't get enough of their constant snark toward one another, nor can I ever get enough of Zoro's santoryu (3-sword style) or Sanji's ridiculously powerful kicks. That's not to say that the rest of the Straw Hats are forgettable, boring, or whatever because that is NOT the case at all. What I love most about the Straw Hats is that despite the predominant focus on Luffy, each member receives a good amount of development and time to shine on-screen. Of course, what are protagonists without their villains? Suffice it to say, Eiichiro Oda's creativity leads to us having quite a lot of interesting villains. Some of them are fucking AWESOME (like Enel in the Skypiea arc) while others are well... lame and stupid (like Buggy in the Orange Town arc). Honestly, this is something you'll have to put up with over the course of One Piece. You think that a limitless well of creativity is free? Oh fuck no! While Eiichiro Oda manages to hit the mark 95% of the time, there are moments where you have to put up with some of his ideas for villains that aren't stupid in an awesome way but are instead just well... stupid (ref: Buggy). Thankfully, arc villains aren't the only ones that the Straw Hats have to deal with. Considering the fact that the Grand Line is so vast in scope, there are a LOT of threats that the Straw Hats have to put up with, two of which being the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The Marines are essentially your maritime police force which deals with pirates while the Seven Warlords are essentially government-sanctioned pirates. In exchange for a cut of the treasure that the Seven Warlords find, the government allows them to basically pick off smaller pirate ships that try to traverse through the Grand Line. Whenever an arc deals with one of the Seven Warlords, there's no doubt that it will be intense. ***THE ART AND ANIMATION*** If the seemingly childish concept, Luffy's stupidity, or the sheer length won't repulse you, chances are that the artwork will make or break your overall experience. Personally, I feel like Eiichiro Oda's artwork has quite a unique charm to it. What I love most about it is that there isn't a single anime/manga series out there that has this exact art style (and before you say anything, Fairy Tail does NOT count). I can understand why some people wouldn't like it since it's rather cartoony and most shonen series nowadays tend to have realistic character designs. Regardless, Hunter x Hunter has a similar ""cartoony"" art style and yet people praise the everliving Christ out of it so if you're gonna talk smack about One Piece's artwork but not levy the same criticism against Hunter x Hunter, you're too stupid for words. Of course... there is one little gripe I have with the art style and that is the fan service. Seriously... One Piece's fan service is something that I can never quite get accustomed to despite having watched the anime AND read the manga for well over 6-7 years. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't find huge tits on top of a skinny waist and lanky limbs to be that attractive. If that weren't bad enough, post-timeskip Nami's outfit is essentially a bikini-top and low-riding pants. Come on, Oda! You expect me to believe that Nami just went through a growth spurt? Don't lie, she paid Chopper to give her a boob job and you know it. Same goes for Nico as well! But, I digress. While I can certainly complain about it all I want, the fan service isn't as bad as OTHER popular shonen series (i.e. Akame ga Kill, Fairy Tail). As for the actual animation itself, it pains me to say that Toei Animation doesn't really have that good of a track record when it comes down to animation quality because they have this nasty habit of producing several long-running anime series alongside one another as they're airing while rotating between animation teams that tend to vary wildly in terms of quality. There's a tendency to go off model every few episodes and it's actually gotten a lot sloppier in the more recent episodes with character proportioning changing at the drop of a hat (let's hope that these animation errors get fixed in an upcoming Blu-ray release or something). The first 206 episodes were more or less par for the course from Toei Animation. There was a lot of good, a good deal of penny pinching along the way, fights were decently animated but nothing worth getting excited over, etc. Episode 207 is when the show makes the switch to HD and a 16:9 resolution and from that point forward, the animation became more fluid and the artwork became a lot cleaner as it ditched some of the line effects and such that it used in the earlier episodes. A general rule of thumb I use is that if an episode I'm watching on Funimation's website has been dubbed, I'll watch the dub instead because dubbed anime generally uses the footage AFTER it's been cleaned up of most of its off-model errors. ***THE SOUNDTRACK*** Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot about One Piece's OST that really caught the fancy of my ears which is quite bizarre since there's usually one or two pieces of BGM that would stand out to my ears while watching. The OP/ED themes are fair enough, and I do have a fondness for a few of them (although I forget their numbers and I'm WAY too lazy to look them up at this point). I will say this though: Skypiea had some pretty damn good BGM even though I couldn't remember any specific tracks that stood out. ***THE DUBS*** If you've ever done a basic Google search on One Piece, you'll probably find out that it had a rather turbulent distribution history here in the USA. It was initially picked up by 4Kids Entertainment and was aired on FOX during Saturday mornings (only to eventually air on Toonami during Saturday nights). Unfortunately, 4Kids has this nasty habit of editing the anime they license WAY past the point of compliance with FCC guidelines. For a full list of 4Kids edits, you can Google it. Most One Piece fans will urge you to stay away from the dub and honestly... I can't really blame them for that (especially now, since Funimation has been distributing One Piece for damn near 7 years and their dub is significantly better). But if we were to take away the content edits that 4Kids was responsible for and focus solely on the actual dubbing, you'd be quite surprised. The actual dubbing isn't quite bad and if you want a real surprise, Marc Diraison (the voice of Guts in the English dub of Berserk) voices Roronoa Zoro in the 4Kids dub of One Piece. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that he's my favourite performance in the entire dub. Erica Schroeder, the voice of Luffy did a fair enough job in her role but some of her lines came off as a bit forced and unnatural (although I blame the ADR director for that, since the woman really is a talented voice actress). As for the Funimation dub, I'd have to say that it's pretty damn good stuff. It's common to hear dub haters say that Colleen Clinkenbeard as Luffy and Brina Palencia as Tony Tony Chopper make their ears bleed, but that judgement is really left up to you. Both Clinkenbeard and Palencia do a great job with the roles they've been given, but I will concede that they can get rather irritating at times (of course, I blame the characters since their voices can be grating in the Japanese dub too). However, my favourite performances would definitely have to be Luci Christian as Nami and Christopher Sabat as Zoro (although I wish that Marc Diraison was still Zoro's voice actor because Guts). It's nice to hear Luci Christian's regular voice and Christopher Sabat not being a large ham and I wish more Funi dubs would play them straight rather than having Christian and Sabat doing exaggerated roles. ***ANIME VS. MANGA/HOW TO WATCH*** When it comes down to anime vs. manga, the manga always wins hands-down for one simple reason: lack of padding. Were it not for Toei Animation's overuse of padding, I'd heartily recommend the anime over the manga since it does have quite a lot going for it. However, it should be noted that you can alternate between the anime and the manga so that you don't have to plough through 760+ chapters or spend 6 months trying to catch up to the One Piece anime. Thankfully, the One Piece wikia can tell you what chapter(s) the episode you're watching is adapting and vice-versa. Rather than sitting through the first 61 episodes, what I recommend is reading the first 100 or so chapters from the manga (it's not as much as it sounds, trust me) and then moving over to the anime at Episode 62. If you ever feel like an episode is dragging on in pace, look up the episode on the One Piece wikia and see what chapter(s) it's adapting, then go ahead and read the corresponding chapter so you don't have to sit through 20+ minutes of something that you could easily read in less than 3-4 minutes. If you feel like the chapter you're reading is confusing or whatever, look it up on the One Piece wiki and then watch the corresponding episode. It's as simple as that, really. What made you think you had to sit through all 670+ episodes to begin with? The manga does exist for a reason. ***FINAL THOUGHTS*** On the whole, One Piece is a very interesting beast to tackle. I like to imagine One Piece as the boss of the Big 3 with Naruto and Bleach standing by its side as its bumbling and incompetent henchmen. While the sheer episode count and turbulent distribution history may put you off from watching it, don't let that scare you. Whereas Studio Pierrot only began adapting Naruto and Bleach in 2005, One Piece has been going on since 1999 so of course there's going to be a stark difference in terms of episode count. For a series that's been going on for 15 years and counting with no end in sight any time soon, it's amazing as to how Eiichiro Oda is able to keep up this level of creativity. Are there low points? Of course, but thankfully they aren't THAT low and are instead very brief. Don't buy into the hate against this series since it's actually quite lovely. ***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS*** 1) Hunter x Hunter (2011) - The bonds between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are similar to the bonds shared between the Straw Hat pirates and what's more is that they both take place in bizarre worlds where fanciful occupations set the stage for tales of grand adventures just waiting to unfold. 2) InuYasha - Both InuYasha and One Piece are more about the journey rather than the destination itself. Both shows comprise of large arcs that are split up between many smaller, easy-to-watch sub-arcs and standalone episodes. Both shows also put a lot of emphasis on friendship and trust (although InuYasha does so for different reasons; it IS a partially romantic story, after all).",8,Recommended,"Nov 11, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d4feea5ae7,1
"One Piss is hands down one of the most childish and badly written Shounen I've come across. There is absolutely nothing interesting about One Piss. It fails at literally everthing it tries to attempt. These are the reasons why One Piss is trash. STORY: 0/10 One Piss is about a trash character called ""Luffy"" that wants to become the pirate king. He gathers a crew of even more awful characters that also have dreams of their own. Almost all of these characters are one dimensional and do absolutely nothing to accomplish their goals. Nami wants to draw a map of the world, yet there isn't a single scene in the manga showing her draw anything. Usopp wants to be a brave warrior, yet after 800+ episodes he's still a coward. Sanji wants to find All Blue, he does absolutely nothing to accomplish his dream. Luffy wants to become pirate king yet there are so many filler arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with this. Here are some examples of arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story: Alabasta, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Drum Kingdom, etc. None of these arcs have anything to do with Luffy becoming the pirate king, yet they each are at least 40 chapters. Even the arcs that are actually relevant are awful. Dressrosa is one of the most poorly written Shounen arcs I've come across. 120 episodes of one arc, bad characters that get too much screen time, generic villain with a generic back story, terrible animation, slow pacing, etc. It cant get any worse than that. For some reason Oda isn't capable of making a story arc that isn't extremely long anymore. He says that he isn't going to make long arcs after dressrosa, yet he makes even more bad arcs that are too long. One Piss arcs are essentially the same thing every single time. The plot is very formulaic. They go to an island and make friends, beat up the bad guys that are oppressing the country, new cremember (sometimes), feast, and then repeat. I mean it continues this bullshit over and over again for over 800 episodes. It already starts to get boring during the Skypiea arc, I'm surprised I could actually tolerate the rest of this trash. One Piss has some of the worst fights I've seen in Shounen. It's actually hilarious how One Piss fans criticize other Shounen like Fairy Tail because of ""friendship powerups"". One Piece does the exact same thing. Every single fight is won by Luffy's sheer willpower, not because he actually outsmarted his opponent. Every One Piss fight is the same exact thing: Luffy tanks evey hit, villain tanks every hit, but then somehow the villain loses because he isn't as durable as Luffy. This is why One Piece fights are extremely boring. It always just ends in asspulls/plot armor. Luffy has won many fights that he shouldn't have won, especially his battle against Katakuri. Katakuri injures himself because a random character interfered in their fight. If you cant see how much a contrived plot device that is, then I don't know what to tell you. One thing One Piece fans praise about this series is how good the world building is. In my opinion, it doesn't mean SHIT if One Piece has good world building. Why should I care about how detailed Oda made the world of One Piece when the crew is just stuck on one island for 100 chapters? The world building is irrelevant if we barely even get to see the rest of the world, besides the Island they spend 200 chapters on. For fucks sake they've only been on 5 for over 300 episodes. CHARACTERS: 0/10 There are rarely any interesting characters in One Piss For the most part, all of the main characters are poorly written. They just get their sad and generic backstories and then they never get character development again. A perfect example of this would be Nami. Sad backstory, then gets no development for the rest of the series. Usopp is another example. After 800 episodes, Usopp still is acting like a coward. 800 episodes and yet he still didn't develop whatsoever. I used to like Sanji until post time skip One Piss completely ruined him. He hasn't had any shine in post timeskip. He loses every damn fight, and he wasn't even in the most important arc of the timeskip. Then Oda makes an arc all for Sanji, which ended up being absolute trash. He just gets a generic sad backstory, doesn't actually change as a character, and then he still gets no shine whatsoever. No one should ever compare this trash character to Zoro. Speaking about Zoro, he's the only straw hat that actually developed as a character. Luffy is hands down the worst Shounen protagonist of all time. Luffy has no character development. None whatsoever. He has no internal characterization at all. None. Any chance he had at character development was ruined because he just ends up going back to how he previously was. If an anime/manga is over 800 chapters/episodes long and the main character doesn't have the abiltiy to reflect on his actions, then that's an absolute problem for the story. To be honest, there's nothing interesting about Luffy. He's just the basic Shounen protagonist that we always see in any Shounen. There are no good villains in One Piece. The only villain I enjoyed is Crocodile, yet he's just a generic villain anyways. Besides him, every other villain is bad. There are no complex villains in One Piece. None whatsoever! ANIMATION/ART: 0/10 Do I even need to explain this? One Piece has the WORST animation I've ever seen in ANY anime. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree with this. I've never seen a Shounen with worse artstyle than One Piece. The characters look extremely ugly too, especially in the Whole Cake Island arc. I don't know why Oda loves drawing ugly ass characters. ENJOYMENT: 1/10 How can I possibly enjoy an anime that has bad characters and a bad plot? The truth is, I cant. It was at least decent until Oda completely destroyed his manga. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because of Zoro OVERALL: 1/10",1,Not Recommended,"Jan 9, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_318f4a7c0d,2
"Well not long ago started watching this series and now have ""watched"" quite a lot. And I don't get how people have so a high opinion of this series. Story: Is quite boring honestly, if you like to watch the same joke 10 * in an episode for 700+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until the Summit War arc. In that arc, there was an interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he pleases and didn't give a damn what others were thinking. That is the only reason I gave this series even 6, would have been 4 or even 3 without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went back to boring as there doesn't seem to be any reason for any fighting again. Art: Well, quality in art is like a roller coaster in this series, some scenes it is good, and some are bad. But I like the old feeling what art style gives and that's why I rated it to 6. Could have been much higher if the quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seem to be they're not scared to use colors what I'm happy about. Sound: To be honest, nothing too fancy but the quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors are not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall. Character(s): Well, characters in this series are 90% of boring or fanservice. There is no character development in this series so I don't get how this series is even going on anymore. Luffy: Pretty good character but I have watched over 500 episodes and still personality is exactly the same as the beginning of the first episode of the whole series. As a fighter, he is getting stronger but it doesn't feel like it at all because still sidekicks give him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly. Usopp: 90% of boredom. He doesn't have growth at all in the whole series as a person. As a fighter, he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That's everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don't even get a reason for this character because of... Tony Tony Chopper: Chopper is pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if the situation requires it. Chopper is as a character is a direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also for Luffy to stop and cries for help but if the situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp doesn't. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series. Nami: This character is 100% of fanservice and nothing else. She doesn't have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just a side character who drops after she's arc end but no. Zoro: This is a most interesting character in the whole series, he is the only one who has grown as a person in the whole crew, and that's pretty sad considering how long this series has already run. Sanji: After Usopp, this is the second most boring character in the whole series. He has not developed as a person nor as a fighter at all. And his obsession with women, a joke that is gone for too long and got boring already. I hope he dies on a nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all. Brook: Can be a quite interesting character but feels like he's going to be in the same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed a really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy's boat he went to the bottom, he honestly doesn't give anything new to the series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper joke so they don't repeat same joke 3 jokes whole episode but 4. Nico Robin: Sometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive the story forward. Franky: Last but not least, this character got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite a lot. I hope they don't ruin this because Franky got a lot of potential as MC. Enjoyment: Well as I said in the story, this series is quite boring and I have been ""watching"" this. Only ""watching"" not watching cause it's hard to enjoy the same jokes over 500 episodes. And usually, I keep this rolling for background sound so when I'm doing other things. I had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations were crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment. Overall: Well this section is more like TL;DR for me - Do you like to watch the same joke in every episode till you die? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - Do you like series that are 90% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - Do you like characters don't grow at all (even after 500 episodes)? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - If you want to watch this you can skip straight to the Summit War arc cause there isn't any development in this series so you won't miss anything.",4,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9d8cab9d7f,2
"One Piece is definitely a must-watch anime series if anyone is looking for an amazing series with tons of character development, an intricate and engrossing story, very emotional moments, character companionship, some amazing fight scenes, as well as a lot of comedic moments. This anime has been in the top 10 in Japan for a long time, and for good reason. Right from the get go, the anime introduces you to Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist of the anime, as well as a few more of his crew that will be sailing the Grand Line with him. Each character that ultimately ends up joining the Strawhat pirates all have a big dream that they want to follow, and usually, that is the reason as to why they join to crew. It's amazing to see how everyone's dream is tied together and Oda has woven it almost flawlessly. Each character also has their strengths and weaknesses which come into play throughout the entire anime. If you haven't tried One Piece, I urge you to give this show a try. If you're not used to its animation, please, don't let that be the sole reason that you don't watch this show. In time, you'll grow to love the animation, and as the series goes on, the animation just gets better and more crisper than before.",9,Recommended,"Jun 1, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9d66c8e251,2
"Oh, I can tell I am getting my full of Battle Shounens for the day. And maybe for the week. So it's time to put away revisiting Hitman Reborn for a while and review an anime I watched recently. One Piece...oh boy. This is a difficult one to review. So let me just say this outright. There are two ways to review something. One, you compare it with its peers and see how it stands. And the other you test it on it's own merits. And you are probably going to say, ""Oh test it on it's own merits that is good!"" Well, I tend to do the former because that is the more Capitalistic of the two. Comparing it with it's peers to see whether or not you should take your time and money elsewhere. And in the end, the former fits more with the dictionary definition of a consumer review. And here's the ""but"". But One Piece's peers are all Battle Shounens, and One Piece is an Action Adventure (Shounen is implied here because Action Adventure is usually aimed at a younger audience). Now, One Piece is an Action Adventure who is competing with other Battle Shounens...so you see my predicament. How can I compare something to other things outside of its genre? It just doesn't work. And that is just not plain fair. But I must compare it to it's peers because it is competing with Naruto, and Bleach, and even smaller ones like Medaka Box, and the aforementioned Hitman Reborn. I must also do this because I have not seen any Action Adventure animes, and I can't compare it to stuff I haven't seen! So, I must grade it as if it were a Battle Shounen. Story: Usually Battle Shounens have bad stories, but this one takes the cake. This is the vaguest plot I have ever seen. And that is because there is no plot. There is no structure. You can look at Naruto and say that there is an overall plot and story line that adds up when you add in all of the arcs. But One Piece doesn't have that. The only plot that is in the show is when the characters are arrive at a new Island. Story: 1/10 Characters: Now before you stop reading this review and hit the ""Not Helpful"" button out of rage. Or God-forbid begin hate commenting on my profile or even sending me death threats because your favorite animu doesn't have a plot; let me get onto the characters. The characters in One Piece are surprisingly well written...To an extent. They all have their own goals and their own struggles which make them all grow together as a team. As a character story this anime does fairly well. Most of the arcs are there for the sole purpose of characterizing one of the characters more. And that is fine, but my question is as follows: Why have none of the characters have had lives outside of seven years old? Let me explain, whenever a character has a flashback to their past they are always seven years old, or a similar age. What, have they been stuck in the hyperbolic time chamber for their entire lives? I mean seriously all of these characters are in their early to late twenties.... What? They are in their teens? No way, those ages are arbitrary, there is no way Sanji is nineteen. And Luffy is seventeen. No way, Sanji is obviously in his late twenties. Maybe 28 or 29. But not Nineteen. And Luffy looks like he is 21. Who are they trying to fool? Seriously. And after the timeskip, Sanji looks like he is in his early thirties. I mean, he even has his Italian porno stache going on. But I am digressing. I am sure that these characters have had some other life changing conflicts outside of a very young age. I mean, the characters get more substance as they go on, it's just I feel that they could have done their initial characterization differently. Characters: 7/10 Sound: I have had no problems with the sound, there are no tracks that particularly stood out to me or ones that I just hated. Sound 7/10 Art: The art is definitely at the beginning of the series a 4/10. But over the years One Piece has gotten with the times and upgraded it's art to a 8/10. So I met it halfway and it is a 6/10. Length: This is a special criteria that will be added into the overall score because I feel that this needs to be mentioned. This show is 600+ episodes long. I love my long running series, Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho come to mind. But those were all 200-300 episodes long. And there is definitely a point where a show gets too long. Yes, Naruto is reaching it's 600th episode as well, if it has not already gotten there (I read the manga). But with Naruto you have the break between the original and Shippuden to break up the monotony. So, I think that One Piece being as long as it is is detrimental to the series. It makes it intimidating for the newcomers to the series, like me, to get into the show. It's like, ""Well, where do I start?"" And beginning at the beginning is a long and hard road to get through, man. And you can't begin somewhere after the beginning because the characters are consistent in their characterization. It's not like Bleach where events happen and they are never mentioned again. One Piece is consistent to the point where the characters are constantly referring to past events. And after their characters get going, this becomes more frequent later on down the road. The time skip is an example. So I am going to rate length like this. 10 being the perfect length for the show, like Madoka Magica. And 1 being so long, or so short, that there is no time to tell the story or characterize the characters, think Angel Beats. So the Length gets a, 4/10. Fights: After giving length it's own special criteria in this review. I hesitate to add another special criteria. But since a lot of peopl- fanboys talk about the fights and compare it to Bleach; I feel they would not be justified if I don't put this in here. For the fights I have not seen with getting as far as I did; I have looked up on YouTube and watched. So, the fights are short. Like, really short. Most of the fights are below 15 minutes with all of the bull edited out. Bull being talking and scene transitioning to see what all of the other characters are doing for a couple of episodes. And this just does not compare when the same thing is done to other shows like Dragonball Z where if all of the bull is edited, the fights go on for 2:40:37 straight. Don't believe me? Citation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB45FE6y_wg So these are the shortest fights, but length shouldn't really matter, shouldn't it? And it wouldn't matter if the fights were sweet. And they are for the most part. I just wish that some fights were longer, like the fight between Luffy and the ""Door Door"" guy with the bull horns. I forget his name. But unfortunately the fight was wasted because the entire point of it was to show off Luffy's new ability. And that is not to mention that some of the fights completely break my willing suspension of disbelief. Like the fight between Zoro and Kaku. I can't explain this with words. Just here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WtrRogy_w And the joke is that this is supposed to be taken seriously. I saw a similar post in the comments. And that person was bombarded with One Piece sales figures to try and justify this. But I noticed that in doing so the One Piece fanboys dodged the question: How can anyone take this seriously? I'm sorry, but I can't. Fights: 3/10 Edit: Oops It appears I forgot the enjoyment criteria, forgive me. Please. Enjoyment: Personally I don't like Action Adventure shows. 2/10 Overall: I guess I should end this with a miraculous conclusion that summs up everything and wraps it all up with a nice bow to boot. But I don't have the energy. Overall 6/10. Edited with Enjoyment this makes the Overall score 5.8/10 rounded up is a 6/10...wow.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_50c0494079,2
"One of the best anime i have ever seen, at points its not as interesting as other anime, but over all it is amazing. One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams. Monkey D Luffy is a character that everyone has to love, he\'s the captain with the strongest dream and love of his crew, but he doesn\'t really act like a captain at all, instead of ordering everyone around, he\'s always just trying to have fun. He loves food, but expecially meat, its supprising how much he can eat. (WATCH THE ANIME!) He can stretch because he is made of rubber and his dream is to become the Pirate King. Roronoa Zoro is the firstmate and swordsman, he always carries around his 3 katana and he seems to care more about them than people. He loves his sake and has a good drink when ever possible, but like a true pirate, he never gets drunk. His dream is to become the best swordsman ever. Usopp is a sharpshooter and total liar. He often calls himself the captain. Can\'t really think of much to say that makes sense if you havnt watched the anime. His dream is to become a true man of the sea. Nami is the navigator who will suddenly change course for money. She takes control of the ship when Luffy is negleting his job and tells them to get a move on. Without Nami, everyone would be always arguing and they wouldn\'t be going anywhere (until Luffy grew up and started acting like a captain). Her dream is to draw a map of the world. Sanji is the cook. But watch out if you are a girl because he\'ll soon be running after you. He always runs after girls when he\'s not busy (generally, but he sometimes does when he is..). He cooks the best food around and is always inproving, but he favouratises the girls when he\'s cooking and gives them the nicest things. His dream is to find All Blue, (WATCH THE ANIME!). Tony Tony Chopper is the doctor, he\'s a reindeer who joins the crew. He can become a human, but he always keeps his blue nose. He\'s a really good doctor and a funny and cute character. (WATCH THE ANIME!) Finnally, Robin, She\'s an archieologist who used to be their enemy. When Luffy saved her when she just wanted to die and had nothing to live for, she joined the crew. Recently, something strange happened to them (WATCH THE ANIME!). She wants to find the rio poneglyph. (WATCH THE ANIME!) It is a very long series and no one wants it to end any time soon.

"I give up. Most people do that before even starting when they see that the series has over 400 episodes. I've watched 490 of them and I just can't take it anymore! I really don't like dropping a series and I generally try to avoid doing so, but the reason to do so is quite plain and simple: this show is a waste of time. The first few story arcs are really interesting. I've even rewatched the episodes where Zoro joins Luffy a few times since it just really draws me in with its excellent story and characters. It's not like I just ""got used to"" the series and the newer episodes ""seem"" dull because of that; those early episodes were really just amazing. The filler episodes throughout the series are intolerable and water the series down greatly, but the main story arcs are quite interesting and can really hook you. The series kinda loses its charm after a couple hundred episodes, though they still keep it pretty fresh when they introduce a new main character. It's the filler that kills this series, really. One Piece appears pretty cartoony at first glance, maybe even stupid. Some of the characters look pretty cool despite that (such as Zoro and Trafalgar Law), and it's a little refreshing to see a group of characters that aren't just a bunch of sexy beasts. Characters like Usopp just look unappealing and ridiculous at first, but even a guy like him can seem really cool as his character develops. I've got no problems with the artstyle, and the series has many serious moments that are convincing enough to make you worry about the characters despite the cartoony look. The long opening themes are one thing, but the long recaps at the start of each episode are brutal and highly unnecessary. I think this problem starts around the Sky Island arc and continues on for the rest of the show. Anyhow, I'm quitting at the Marineford war. That was 30 episodes of Luffy endlessly running towards the platform shouting ""ACE!"" while Ace would shout ""LUFFY!"" and ""K...kh...hh...!"", whatever that means. Half of it was just random pirates and marines firing their guns towards off the screen. I think the ""war"" atmosphere was really just boring and not suited to One Piece, especially since the all the fillers made it appear very slowpaced. The show lost its emotion and intensity. There are better things to come, but I can't handle these worthless fillers anymore. One Piece is nearly 500 episodes long and it isn't going to end anytime soon; they're only halfway to One Piece and the real battle is just beginning. I'm sure there'll be peaceful people living happily in the ""New World"" just like in the rest of the Grand Line, though, despite the fact that it's supposed to be the most incredibly dangerous place in the world. 30 episodes of straight bullshit. Well, I'm sure the worthlessness and stalling amounted to at least 100 episodes. There are some truly incredible series that are only 24 episodes long; you'd do well to watch some of those instead of sitting through One Piece fillers. I recommend reading the manga instead; no fillers and the art is more interesting. I think I'd give One Piece a 9/10 if it weren't for the fillers. The last point would be saved for an ending, which this series will never have. Don't watch the fillers for completion's sake like I did; they really aren't worth it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 3, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bea1f0c4e5,2
"Recently I started to notice that the One Piece fandom has become really toxic and likes to compare/attack other anime, claiming that ""One Piece is the best anime"" and I honestly don't understand it. The pacing alone disqualifies this anime from competing for the title of ""best"" not to mention the rest of the problems this anime has. I don't read the manga, it probably doesn't have such big problems with pacing as the anime but never mind... I haven't read it, I won't comment, I mean the ANIME which is far from what One Piece fans think about it... Let's start with the ultra awful pacing... it's best illustrated by comparison to Jojo (a manga that has a similar number of total pages as Ona Piece) out of 80 volumes of the manga there are 190 episodes of Jojo (parts 1-5) and ATTENTION... as many as 755 episodes of One Piece, this series is so stretched and doesn't compensate for it with anything. The One Piece anime, trying to prevent it from catching up with the source material (as other long series try to do), does the worst thing possible. Other similar series prevent this with filler episodes, One Piece stretches/dilutes the original plot to the limits of its possibilities, drastically reducing its value, in the case of other series, episodes that are not part of the main plot could be easily skipped, in the case of One Piece there is no such possibility because the filler is written into the episode, it's just a tragedy. But OK, this anime has terrible pacing but is the plot really good anyway? No, it's average and ultra formulaic. This anime had the potential to be a really good adventure anime, 1000 episodes give the opportunity to tell about really many adventures of our heroes, however (also touching on the pace) we are trapped for several hundred episodes in one place and once again, most of it is not compensated by anything special. Because yes, most of the arcs (apart from the mass of pointless, boring and too long plots in between) look almost identical, the schematic nature of this anime is terrifying: The crew arrives on a new island -> Luffy meets new friends who are terrorized by a bad guy -> Luffy and the rest split up, Luffy runs to the boss and the rest beat up the minions -> Luffy fights the boss as always and Zoro and Sanji fight the vice captains, there are some exceptions but overall it looks the same, without any surprises. The fact that the characters always run somewhere for almost half of each arc is already a meme. I'm not saying that the plot is tragic, it has a lot of good moments but it's still far from very good. Moving on... ""Dragonballization"" from the beginning of the Wano arc, this anime decided to start moving towards Dragon Ball, when previously the fights of the most popular characters in this universe looked good but still mundane, in the Wano Arc suddenly the power scale skyrocketed, they started introducing various colorful auras and a lot of different exaggerated effects, it introduces a huge inconsistency compared to the rest of the anime. It seems like One Piece is losing its entire atmosphere in favor of the exaggerated efficiency we see in today's shounen, but they have been like that from the beginning and do not seem inconsistent like One Piece, which started introducing all this crap relatively recently. One Piece lost a bit of ""it"" after the time skip, it seems like the character interactions became less natural, more forced and there are fewer of them in general due to more frequent character separation, some characters lost their character and meaning, Usopp and Chpper were mostly reduced to boring comic relief. Luffy (MC) well... his lack of development hurts me, the lack of development itself is not a bad thing BUT when the plot hits the hero with a traumatic event that screams ""you idiot, you have to learn from this"" and he gets up and moves forward without a moment's hesitation... it's stupid and makes this dramatic and important event irrelevant. Luffy lost his entire crew due to his own stupidity (he was convinced of it) and what does he do in the rest of the story? he repeats the same mistake without a moment's reflection and provokes the emperor without any real preparation, stupid characters are cool and funny until their stupidity is simply annoying and gives the feeling that the character is completely empty. Additionally, for the vast majority of the time, Luffy stood out because unlike other anime of this type, he does not have hidden powers, he motivated by the fact that with seemingly weak powers, thanks to his willpower, he was able to pursue his goal, cliché? Yes, it works? Yes, but the author decided to surprise everyone and make Luffy a divine chosen one with divine powers and all this in the name of what? The ""symbol of freedom"" narrative does not compensate for this because Luffy is ultimately no different in this respect from the rest of the typical shounen MC. Yes, Luffy is a ""symbol of freedom"" even though he doesn't see himself as such, but in the end it seems like he's just an idiot and does whatever he wants, the fact that he frees the oppressed doesn't matter because he only does it when his friends are imprisoned, his perspective is limited and if he doesn't see that someone has a problem he won't help them, he won't stop the world government which is a symbol of oppression xD but still, being a ""symbol of freedom"" doesn't require being a divine chosen one at the same time, what's the value of all that determination Luffy has and everything he's been through so far? if at the end, when the ceiling was too high, the author came up with an ultra big plot twist and gave MC divine powers is completely uninspiring and contradicts what we've seen in most of One Piece. All that I wrote above is not everything, there would definitely be something more, but I didn't sit with a notebook in my hand while watching this anime and I don't remember everything, so well....

"One Piece starts great. It has original setting for its time, it introduces the best hook in all shounen anime, important characters are nicely fleshed out, the main character cannot one punch every enemy, and the story doesn’t feel like the original creator has run out of ideas. But this was many years ago. It doesn't look like an anime worth watching in 2017. Since One Piece was first published in 1997 as a manga, and was animated in 1999, it took decades to tell the story. Its creator Eiichiro Oda had just graduated from high school back in the 1990s. He kept writing the same story well into his middle ages. I grew old watching and reading One Piece. I sometimes wonder how many fans have died waiting for the story to end. Please, if you ever create a story do end it before your youngest readers get their menopause or other age-related changes. Fans aren’t immortals to indulge storytellers. Even Eiichiro Oda is taking more and more breaks to take care of his health. Otherwise he cannot continue the work. One Piece has one unique element that is hard to find in other long-airing anime. Its story is solid. It has actually two different storylines which Oda skillfully combines into a single plot. The first is the story of Straw Hat Pirates led by Luffy. The second is the history of the world of One Piece. As Straw Hat pirates continue their adventures they also discover the truth about their world. The pirate king who died decades ago left a great treasure called One Piece which somehow can change the fate of the world. The world government fights against pirates who want to become the next pirate king by finding that incredible treasure. As you can see, the lives of individual characters are more or less related to the world’s history. It makes the story more realistic. More, these two parallel storylines in a single plot make the anime even more interesting when they meet. This double-storyline method makes it possible for the lives of different characters to be intertwined naturally. In One Piece supporting characters have lives of their own. Every character is also part of the world depicted. They don’t feel like talking heads in the void. Their lives are not isolated from each other. Because the history of the world is so vast, there’s always something going on behind the stage. Actions of important people belonging to the world of One Piece have crucial importance. They can change the fate of the world. Furthermore, the aftermath of crucial battles does have repercussions for others as well. By careful storytelling Eiichiro Oda succeeds in preventing the main character from becoming an undisputed god in power. Another feature of this method is that there is actually more organic tragedy in One Piece. Overall, One Piece stands out for its original storytelling for shounen, but sadly, like all long-lasting stories, it got old. Its creator got old. Its fans got old. The world got old.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 9, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_af0028e4ea,2
"Well where do i start ... there is so much to say.. for the super fans of One Piece, i'm going to punish this anime so this review may piss you off. This anime, like any other big shonen, made a crucial mistake that i'm going to explore, besides that, the rest is fine. Story: 7/10. Well.. it is hard to explain this rate. Is the plot original and creative? Yes it is, but it does not sound nice ! It seems like they started with a decent plot, and then they just keep adding things to make it bigger. I mean, the plot doesn´t need to be 'stupid'. I don´t mind if there is unicorns or mermaids or even islands in the sky but keep adding things will not make the plot better. But this is not the main reason for this rate .. The story takes to much time to be developed.. I mean we have arcs with 60 eps or even more.. i've seen animes with 24 with more content than these arcs with 60 or more eps .. the pace is just to damn slow which makes the anime boring at some point. Plus, we can have one hundred different islands, each one with something different, if the story is always the same, it won´t make us hooked. Because yes it's always the same, we have a bad powerfull guy that took control of the island, and the weak good guys asked for Luffy's help and that's basically the entire anime is all about ... and ofc Luffy will always win. If the plot is always the same thing throughout 700 eps, there is no way for it to be good ! Besides all of those bad points, there is a good point.. the ""Akuma no mi"", those fruits that grants them powers are really nice. We have so many different powers and we always want to know which power the bad guy has. Because we never know, there are so many.. Art: 7/10. The anime starts with a crappy art, but then gets better with the time but never reached great levels ... the action sometimes has no detail. Some special movements or attacks we can´t even see them (especially when is about swordsman .. i mean they use their special movement, but we don´t see him actually using it, we just see the enemy being hit.. and that just sucks). The background is reasonable at least so as the character design. Sound: 8/10. Nice openings .. all of them portray the happy theme that One Piece talks about (friendship). The OSTs are reasonable enough to make the action and the drama good. Character: 8/10. For me, the best point here. We have nice characters with a nice development and a nice past (actually when they were telling the past of some character, i nearly cried at some, because they were dramatic enough to make me care a lot.) BUT .. it's like watching the same character every single time. All of them can be resumed to this sentence: ""I care about my friends so i'm going to protect them at any cost"" .. basically they look like this.. About the villians .. we have some nice villians actually .. they make us hate them, so when they get defeated we feel relieved xD but they are also the same shit. The motivations are always the SAME (take control of something, usually the island). So .. we don´t have that variety of characters that we see in other animes .. It's basically the good guys vs the bad guys .. Enjoyment: 7/10. This anime starts being good as hell, with nice fights and nice development but .. it was good because it was new for me. When i was in the 500th ep or so i was like ""yh yh let's move on to the fights instead i don´t care about your story !!!"" .. and there is even some arcs that were painfull to watch .. Overall : 6/10.. this anime is just too big .. it has nice characters, nice development and even a interesting plot .. but not for 700 eps .. if you are looking for some nice action anime, or even some nice shonen .. well you can watch this one, at least the first few arcs because those are good but i think it doesn´t worth, if you are like me, when you start something and then you have to end it, well don´t touch in this anime. Because you will get bored.. it's just to damn long. Furthermore, it gets repetitive so i don´t see the point in watching this.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 20, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9dfa63e5cb,2
"Okay, this is a LONG series, so it's kinda hard to review it as a whole because I feel completely differently at different points of the series. So I'll break it up into three sections My overall score is based on the last section though. First Section [Episodes 1 - 223] I'd call this a pretty fun anime almost out of the gate. It was really exciting seeing a very unique world, unique premise and interesting characters to wonder about right away. I really enjoyed that a lot of characters were introduced very early on as very powerful people, but we were totally left to wonder about them. This is very essential to getting people excited about what's to come. As far as the characters go, although they are all pretty one dimensional, they are all very likeable (except for Usopp, I can't stand him). Luffy is kinda hard to hate and there is someone to like for everyone in the series. The story definitely drags a bit. Lot's of filler and pointless sub-plots that drag on for several episodes, but still pretty enjoyable. The main plot continued to thicken and it definitely was alive enough to keep me watching. Second Section [Episodes 223 - 516] I'd say this is definitely the best section in the anime. This is essentially the build up to the Whitebeard arc, but not before going to Water Seven and really spicing up the story with new, powerful characters and big character development between Luffy's crewmates. Water Seven was good, but the chapter after that was a bit dull. Kinda just waiting for what eventually became the Whitebeard arc. Once that started, I was at the edge of my seat watching it all the way through. It does go on and on and on, but you finally get to see some badass characters fight and Luffy really stepping up in power quite a bit. Very fun watch, even though some episodes are worth skipping. I very much liked this anime up until this point. Third Section [Episodes 516 - 677 (ongoing)] Here is where I really started to fall off. At first it wasn't so bad, but I progressively realized that I wasn't looking forward to anything in this anime, and as soon as I caught up with the release cycle and was watching weekly since about episode 590, I realized that nothing was happening on an episode to episode basis and as it kept going, even less would happen in each episode. The last 20 episodes has been some of the worst. Every week I watch it for whatever reason, and every week I realize that I would have missed absolutely nothing if the whole episode was turned into a recap clip. Episodes don't really begin until about 4 minutes and 30 seconds in, and even then, it's essentially rehashing the last 5 minutes of the episode before that. They spend FAR too much screen time with reaction shots, sound effects and a bunch of shit that doesn't matter and very little with progressing the story line. I don't think there has been an episode in a while that would take more than 3-4 sentences to describe literally everything that happened. [Overall / Story / World] I do like the premise of the power system in One Piece. It's a pretty simple idea and pretty flexible. You obviously have to dismiss some stuff that simply don't make sense, but you fine with it... at least at the start of the story. Later on though, you quickly realize how unpolished the power system is. You have literally no balance at all. Bad guys will crazy OP powers can seemingly never exhaust their power, but Luffy is tired almost immediately after he starts a long fight. And as they add more concepts into the system, the more you think to yourself, why did we never see this before if everyone can fucking do it? They are all traveling the grand line, but seemingly every other pirate is waiting just ahead of Luffy waiting for him to catch up. Even with a 2 year gap, pirates haven't progressed at all down the grand line while it only took Luffy 1 year to travel the first half. The story just starts to break with time and characters are becoming progressively less interesting... However, it could be improve a lot if I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching each episode because nothing fucking happens. (and yes, I'm including even episode 677. Doesn't justify the previous 20 being about a bunch of nothing).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2952fdcd1f,2
"Where to begin!? One Piece is a very adventurous story. Never in one place for too long the story is full fun and unusual things. One Piece is about a rather childish 17 year old boy (Monkey D. Luffy) who aspires to reach his dreams of becoming Pirate King and keeping the promises he's made. Meeting many a friend along the way the story progresses through many story arcs that build the personality and integrity of each character. The first friend and crew member he makes is his ever faithful First Mate (Zoro) who also has a dream to achieve. I am not going to explain every character. That would take too long and it would spoil some of the fun. The best way to understand this anime is to watch it. One Piece is a really good story, perfect for anyone who likes pirate stories. Though a very long and yet unfinished story thus far, I find it to be very enjoyable. The comedy is some of the best I have seen in any anime. I recommend watching in its original japanese with english subtitles (preferably fan-subbed). The dubbed version by 4kids entertainment is TERRIBLE! They have also stopped dubbing it anyway. Funimation has taken over dubbing One Piece in English and has done a far better job. As far as fansub groups go, I recommend Kaizoku-Fansubs, Vegapunk and Instantz Noob Production. Kaizoku-fansubs (K-F)started subbing the series from the beginning and they are still subbing it today with flying colors. They are the way to go for most of the available episodes. The other groups have what goes after the episodes K-F has done so far. Good luck finding and downloading without any problems. Torrent is the easiest way to get them. Otherwise you can get them from IRC. This is my favorite anime above all so... Enjoy the show!",10,Recommended,"Apr 29, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_aabdde3a36,2
"The premise is simple enough. The main character seeks to become the pirate king by finding a treasure called One Piece (you wonder where they come up with these English names ..) and starts by assembling a crew. The pattern then becomes sailing from island to island, finding problematic villains and sending them packing, gathering crew members, and meeting people. I had high expectations of One Piece. As one of the most popular and best-selling manga stories in Japan at the time (and still is) and of the shounen genre that I am fond of, I expected nothing less. So when Kaizoku-fansubs first started releasing good quality fansubs in 2003 (as compared to the HK rips, where calling the subtitles English is generous), I decided to give the series a shot. I was disappointed. As I began watching One Piece, it wasn’t as though I didn’t like the series at all. It was watchable. Generally enjoyable. It just failed to meet the expectations I had. That was probably the problem. I continued to watch the series on and off, with the early main characters (Luffy and Zoro) growing on me slowly, and Usopp knocking down my interest a bit. I started warming up to the series during Sanji’s arc. Finally, Nami’s arc sealed the deal. For those familiar with her arc, which I still feel is the best of the crew’s back stories, I can say there were multiple, very memorable moments. The feelings were real. I cried for the first time while watching this series. I cared very much for the characters, and for what happened to them. I went from lukewarm to obsessed about One Piece. Its been over 5 years since then, and I still consider One Piece to be one of my favorite stories, both the manga and anime adaptations. I think One Piece achieves something very rare in its genre. This isn’t something that I felt all along, but as I’ve examined why I continue to love One Piece, it’s a theory that I think helps to explain it. Shounen series in general place a heavy emphasis on fighting. It defines the genre. Of course, there are reasons the characters fight, and those reasons can often result in long expositions and flashbacks (in the middle of fights, unfortunately). One Piece is no different. How One Piece is different is that the fighting is truly a means to an end, not because you know it should be, but because it really is (with many other series, the fighting is usually why we’re watching, whatever else the story might say). Often, the aftermath and outcomes of the fights are far more rewarding and what one looks forward to, rather than the fights themselves. A subtle difference, but it makes all the difference in setting One Piece apart from most shounen series. One Piece is at its most heartwarming in the aftermath of the battles, and in exploring its characters. It is most enjoyable when it focuses on the antics of the characters as they explore the places they go and generally get themselves into situations. The interactions between the crew members have spawned tons of hilarious exchanges and scenarios, many which are simply priceless. One Piece’s main characters, the Straw Hat pirates, are molded after common cliches, yet, as with better stories, make those cliches their own and find a way to be quirkier. The characters, one and all, can be unabashedly silly yet transition convincingly to deadly serious. No transition is greater than with Luffy, the main character. Although he appears goofy and simple, his attitude is better described as fun-loving and child-like, with an innate fascination of the world, new things, and exploration. He isn’t dumb; rather he ignores typical adult concerns and conventions because they just don’t interest him. Yet we understand what matters to him. So when those things are threatened, his seriousness is wholly believable, even if it’s in direct contrast with his usual demeanor. And when he is serious, he can only be described as incredibly cool ^_^ Remarkably, One Piece manages to balance a genuine lightheartedness through its humor and exuberance, with the gravity of the battles and hardships. That lightheartedness is missing from most shounen series. Other series have humor but there is joy in One Piece, which is apparently more difficult to create. Not to say that this necessarily makes a good story, but it is unique and I’ve seldom encountered other shounen series that exude the same fun and silliness, even as it packs on fights, special powers, and bigger and badder enemies. I should note that One Piece lacks some of what I consider to be vital elements of a good story, most notably character development and growth, and real tension (i.e., death is possible). I’ll skip the last, since most series aren’t going to kill off their main characters, but I've not missed the other things, yet. First and foremost, One Piece is a lot of fun. It's a story that inspires imagination, and a desire to explore and see new things. It consistently makes me smile. And while real tension may be lacking, it doesn't lack for touching or heartbreaking storylines. One Piece is an amazing ride. Not for everyone, perhaps, but if themes of friendship, dreams, and exploration, wrapped in a fun package not afraid to be silly, with a healthy dash of fighting, appeals to you, what are you waiting for?",10,Recommended,"May 11, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f5743c296c,2
"One Piece, is truly one of my favourite Anime and Manga. Although, in the beggining it took me some time to warm up to it. Story The first part of the series begins by introducing each character as they join the main crew. It didn't really seem that interesting to me at first, but since a friend of mine was watching it with me I decided to continue it. After the beggining of the Arabasta Arc I began to love the series more and more after every Arc. The mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy, Politics are all given in a smooth and enjoyable pace. Also, the story gives the viewers some important messages concerning friendship and how people should not give up on what they believe. Art The art is really good for a long running series, especially after the High Definition enhancement. It might seem pretty different in the beginning after adapting from Oda Eiichiro-san's art from the manga. I'm not saying it's perfect but it truly is interesting. Sound The Openings and Endings used in the show can sometimes become addictive, you might find yourself in the middle of the road humming the new Opening theme (At least I do some times :P). The background music is also fitting for the series adding some new tracks in later episodes but I don't think they're anything special. Characters The one thing that makes One Piece one of the top series are the characters. Each and every one of them has a different personality both funny and serious and all with a tearjerking past. Furthermore, all of them get equal attention and spotlight. Enjoyment As I said before, the more I continue the series the more I enjoy it. It's really continuing on at a good pace, exploring different genres (e.x. The Thriller Bark Arc) Overall, One Piece has been entertaining from every aspect. From it's hilarious comedy to it's Epic battles. If you have time or are interested in watching a long running series (and I'm sure it has a lot more to go) them don't hesitate to begin watching One Piece, you won't regret it!!",10,Recommended,"Oct 28, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b25ba34b3c,2
"Short review: For me, this anime was the greatest anime to ever exist for the first ~500 episodes (which is impressively long by almost any standard) but then after that, the anime began to steadily worsen over time. I'm going to portion my experience into three main parts: pre-time skip, post-time skip, and my overall general view. Long review: - Pre-time skip: When I first got into OP, I instantly fell in love with it for many reasons. I'll name the big main ones. First, the atmosphere and theme of anime was unique; the idea of sailing the seas to find different unique islands, finding exciting new things, and the variety of different devil fruit powers and bosses are all well constructed it felt like the anime had it all when it comes to overall theme: it's new, it's intriguing, and it's exciting especially for the first time you experience it. Second, the side characters in the straw hats were not very complex or advanced but they were very unique in their own way and likable (probably other than Usopp), each had an interesting backstory and dream, each said something interesting from time to time that was more than some overused gag, and most importantly (this is very important) they actually felt like they actively existed and were adding to the storyline while still peaking my interest. Third, I was so excited about so many things including the the other straw hats: I had so many exciting questions unanswered and my expectation would be that they would be answered soon enough (guess what? they weren't). Fourth, a lot of events just made me cry buckets. I rarely get emotional when watching anything really. I think making the viewer emotional over a show isn't easy to do since being emotional means that the narrator successfully made a good story with good elements and characters that one can get emotionally invested in along with a really good production team that can recreate those events very well. There were no cons in the pre-time skip that are worth mentioning other than some scenes feeling unnecessarily stretched out and Kaku being the worst gag of a villain ever (seriously? a giraffe with a nose for a sword?). - Post-time skip: My love/hate relationship begins here. At first it was all love, to me this was the greatest piece of fiction to ever be created but now, not so much. The novelty of a lot of concepts within the show such as the devil fruits, the crazy ideas of islands, and so on begins to wear off after the time-skip. Post-time skip, you start to notice that Oda has this script that he repeats in almost every single arc involving the straw hats; this script isn't really an issue when you first experience it but after a few times it just gets incredibly boring and predictable. What really pisses me off is that we are almost towards the end and Oda is still using the script again in egghead. The script is basically: 1- Luffy arrives at Z island 2- Luffy meets some main X friend in Z island 3- X friend is in trouble 4- Luffy helps X friend which involves miraculously beating bad guy(s) along the way which saves X's kingdom/island (usually a scene here where you're supposed to cry happens). This happens almost every single arc and it gets so damn boring to see after a while. I can already see this pattern happening with Egghead. Oda tries to spice the script up but it's more or less the same. This script is a very lazy and boring way of writing up a story that had many elements of success. The script also makes those emotional scenes I talked about incredibly less effective since you can predict what will happen very easily from early on. Remember how I was talking about the straw hats? Well, here these characters are incredibly dumbed down to one-liners (haha usopp has that funny scaredy cat disease! or haha Nico robin back at it again with a sad joke or haha zoro lost his away again ROFL). Instead of further developing the other straw hats, Oda is not only dumbing them down now but also making them incredibly less involved in any thing significant. Oda tries to undo this by sometimes having them involved in incredibly short-lived pointless subplots but it just comes out to be lame. Spoilers being in the show's opening is so frustrating. I do not read the manga, why am I being told of so many major events going on? I do not want to know all these spoilers; can I just skip the opening of the show? Sure and I have done that but I shouldn't have to worry about finding out there's a new crew member before they actually join from the opening OF THE DAMN SHOW, I shouldn't have to worry about finding out where X missing person's whereabouts are from the opening when they haven't found them yet, and so much other stuff. The story has been moving at an incredibly slow pace that the One Piece treasure hunt seems like a lost subplot: when other shows take years showing significant progress towards a character's goal(s), with one piece it is years ON THE SAME ISLAND with almost zero progress. I have reached a point where it does not matter whether the one piece treasure is is a bunch of gold on some random island, a bomb equal to 100000 nukes, or some secret majestic powers, the excitement just isn't there because it has been unaddressed for hundreds of episodes. Now that I'm thinking about it, this is a crappy thing Oda loves to do: he will tease you really hard with a supposedly HUGE unknown/possible thing within the story and either never deliver the answer or just take so long that you start to lose interest. My interpretation is that the author does this to maintain interest throughout the series but actually after a while it just gets annoying since it is sooooo overdone. One of the worst downgrades about the post-time skip is the introduction of haki within fights. My number one issue with it is that it made arguably the strongest type of devil fruits seem like a joke since haki renders it almost useless along with significantly weakening the other types of devil fruits as well. In summary, the introduction of haki is more of an overhaul of the both the power scale and battle system within the anime rather than an addition since haki is basically either just strength or some other busted type of haki that only a select few have. Pre-time skip fights were more fun and entertaining as fights involved some strategy or some expectation of how the fight might look like before it begins (I.e a logia vs a paramecia is not the same as a logia vs logia). However, now with haki it leaves fights way less interesting since more haki can demolish just about anyone, if you have enough of it, in the most boring way possible. - Overall thoughts and general view: The show feels completely different than what it started as in a bad way. What started off as a pirate crew's adventure towards an exciting unknown treasure moved towards a god-like superhero show where the MC is just saving everyone all the time. Normally, shows can have more than one plot(s) but moving the whole idea of Luffy from a pirate who wants to capture the great treasure into some God-like savior WHILE JUST BARELY moving forward the first plot in any meaningful manner seems like a terrible idea. Another thing is Luffy has to be one of the worst main characters of all time. His personality consists of shouting, being reckless, eating an OP devil fruit, and every other very basic main character (loves his friends crew, adventurous, honorable etc..). What do we actually know about luffy? Very little. Has luffy changed at all as a main character during 1000+ episodes? No. Has his experiences changed him in any way? No. We don't even know his ""real"" motive and dream related to wanting to be the pirate king. For me, generally speaking, the pre-time skip alone carries the overwhelming majority of my rating points. All the recent arcs along with all the post-time skip content is very underwhelming, repetitive, and simply put: a snooze fest. The post-time skip part of this anime makes it enough to not recommend anyone getting caught up in a show that starts off excellent but screws up everything as it gets closer towards the end.",7,Not Recommended,"Aug 14, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f70bbbeb0,2
"The story is quite decent and voice acting is also. This deserves 7/8, but some of the fandom is so trash like they adulates toei so much that some of them even say One piece's pacing isn't a problem. So, it fueled my mind and not giving it more than a 4. I request all of you to read the manga or wait for the remake to be released. Toei just butchered the series with insane slow pacing and below average animation quality. We live in a world where AOT adapts 33 volumes into 94 episodes and One Piece adapts 33 volumes into 300+ episodes 😭, man just accept it's pacing problem isn't just minor, it's huge.

Sound: One Piece have an amazing soundtrack that is working out very nicely with whats happening at the moment it is played. One of the best OST ever if you ask me. Character: Can't come up with another show with so good characters as there is in One Piece. They're all amazing, funny and you kind of get to know them yourself. Enjoyment: The enjoyment is on top everytime you watch a One Piece episode. You're sitting there, watching amazing fights, funny crazyness (mostly by Luffy, Usopp and a little from Chopper). You see very good friendship and some touching scenes. On top of this you got amazing animation, soundtrack and the best story ever made. Overall: Really don't know what to write here, other than that this show is the best ever made in my opinion. If you think it is a bit too long you should just try some episodes or one of the movies, after that you can't go back and you end up watching all the episodes!

"At first I was a bit skeptical to watch this but once I got more and more into the story I just couldn't stop watching. Sure there is a ton of episodes but I find it well worth it to watch it all. The concept behind the whole story is very emotional. I felt every possible emotion the characters portrayed in One Piece. I even laughed so hard and shed a few tears. If One Piece doesn't want to make you go out become a pirate yourself or simply follow your dreams no matter what, then I don't know what will!",10,Recommended,"Aug 1, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c734463925,2
"Well I thought it was a good idea for me to wright a review for my favorite anime and seeing as how I am a major fan of it I might over rate it but I will try to control this. :D Story: The story is about a boy named Monkey D Luffy he wants to become the greatest pirate and claim the title King of The Pirates. Now I will be honist here the first couple of episodes are not nearly as good as they are now, but hey he gets better soon. The story dosent pick up till Luffy gets four other crew members and the Fifth story arc (they are short atfirst). The fifth story is what made me love Op it has everything a person could want, humor, action, plot, emotion. Then after this point in the series it just gets better and is why it is one of the top anime/manga\'s of this day and age. Animation: The animation is a little differnt. I guess you could say it kinda looks like its a cartoon/anime and the characters can look kinda goofy sometimes but it does fit the setting of the show. I gave it a 8 even though I love how it looks. Sound: OMG some of the best music ever it is amazing. The sound tracks to OP is outstanding, that is the only way to describe it. (why they took it out of the english version and replaced it with rap still makes me wonder) Enjoyment: There is only a few other things that I enjoy more that watching OP. Including every above plus it has very good movies and fillers. I will actualy watch One Piece\'s fillers and enjoy them, thats how good they are. Overall: I would say check out this anime no matter what.",10,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_874fc2e499,2
"Instead of giving the anime a ten simply because it's One Piece, let's take a step back and look at this anime from an objective stand point. The characters and the story is amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites, but wow. Those are the only redeeming qualities about it and all of it comes from the mangaka. Let's start with the things that make this adaption garbage compared to the manga that cannot be argued. The pacing. I have no idea when it was, but at about the middle of the pre-timeskip, Toei decided it was a good idea to adapt a chapter an episode leaving some arcs almost completely unwatchable - full of scenes that drag on continuously and fillers that weren't originally in the manga. This is most apparent during the dressrosa arc, which has been a little slow in the manga, but is still pretty good, but is nearly unwatchable because of the pacing issues. The animation and the art. Do I really have to say anything about this? Anyone who's watched One Piece extensively knows just how garbage it is, but will continue to watch it anyway because it's One Piece (me being one of those people) and that is why Toei will keep doing what they're doing with the anime. http://oen-peice.tumblr.com/ Go through there and tell me that I'm wrong about this. This anime is not a proper adaptation for the manga and the only proper way to experience it is through the manga. It was somewhat good in the beginning, but become nearly unwatchable as you get to the later arcs. There is nothing I can really subjectively complain about except for maybe the lack of death and how subpar the timeskip has been compared to pre-timeskip.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 13, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_95f933c0c1,2

"""It has 700++ episodes"" ""This show is for kids"" ""This show sucks"" ETC *Contains heavy spoiler* Are what most people who don't watch One Piece would say. This is because they are just simply overwhelmed by the number of episodes. There are also people who claimed to have watch the show but it still sucks, so I asked a simple question what was their impression on Nami's backstory and they were unable to answer which is a solid proof that they didn't even watch more than 25 episodes. Three years ago, I was a hater of this series but after I saw the manga sales list, I was surprised to see that the manga sale is so overwhelming so I decided to start watching it and now I am here. One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy and his companions, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook travelling the whole world in order to achieve their own dreams. Story 10/10 The story started with an epic entrance. I have never seen any character enter the scene which such way. At first, it made people think that Coby was the main character because he was heavily focused on, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy just suddenly came out of it while shouting ""that was a nice nap!"", I was stunned because it was hilarious yet a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different island had different uniqueness! Oda is very creative! It's fun to see they are travelling around, discovering mysteries. Talking about mysteries, One Piece has this ""Void Century"" mysteries which is that 800 years ago, there were a period of 100 years where there were simply no record and the government stopped people from finding the full history. They would go to the point of eliminating every single innocent citizen just because of knowing this history. The only for someone to know the Void Century, one must know how to read Poneglyph. Robin was the last person to be able to read the Poneglyph and she was being chased for 20 years ever since she was an eight year old girl. One Piece consisted many tearjerking moments. E.g Bellemere's death, Doctor Hiluluk's death, story about Montblanc Cricket, Going Merry's final moment, Ace's death, Whitebeard's death, Corazon's death. Animation 1/10 Toei is lazy as fuck Sound 10/10 I don't really care about sound but One Piece has some good OSTs. Character 10/10 -Character development- The first character development started with Coby. He was a coward, but after he saw Luffy's determination, Coby fought his own cowardice and tried to achieve his own dream. The second character development was Zoro. He was not afraid of dying when he faced off the world's strongest swordsman. Zoro later acknowledged that he was a weakling thus he strove on becoming stronger. The third character development was Usopp. Despite he he himself knew that Kaya knew he was lying, he still lied to Kaya in order for her to relieve her boredom due to Kaya's condition that she couldn't live her life freely, Usopp started lying because of his late mother. He tried to cheer his mother by shouting ""pirates are coming"" because his dad, Yassop was a pirate. The fourth character development was Nami. It was revealed that her past was so sad. When she was ten, her step mother, Bellemere, was murdered right in front of her eyes. It was due to that Bellemere didn't have any money to pay to the pirates who invaded their hometown. Bellemere, despite having the chance to just say she lived alone in the house, chose to admit that she had daughter because of her believe that she would never say she didn't have a family. This showed that Bellemere rather die than to disowned her stepdaughters. The story didn't end there, Nami, being a genius girl who was able to draw a perfect map despite being a ten year old girl was forced to work for the pirate that killed her mother figure. The pirate wanted her talent. They made a deal that if she can pay him 1 million Beli (1 million Yen = 8135 USD) they would leave the village. For eight years, Nami stored up to 700 K like Arlong's slave. But Arlong betrayed her. I can go on but these are some proofs to show that One Piece does have lots of character developments. Enjoyment 10/10 With a good and entertaining storyline, of course the enjoyment will be there. Overall 10/10",10,Recommended,"Nov 30, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1bb8cb0e6e,3
"One Piece is the most over hyped piece of trash i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Below are some, but not all, (as there are too many for a simple review) of my biggest issues with this horrendous work of fiction. Female Character designs: When asked about his process for drawing female characters, Oda wrote "" Yes. Hello. It's drawing time at the SBS segment. I would suggest that you think of a woman's proportions as ""three circles, one X"". Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be leaving."" This is a great start because it shows what his female characters main roles are in the story; to be fan service. It's no secret that after the timeskip, Nami and Robin (who were both already done with puberty) somehow went through puberty again and grew huge breast. I don't personally have an issue with any of his female character designs but how is this any different than Fairy Tail or Bleach sexulaizing its female cast members? Nami and her dream: Nami's dream is to draw a map of the world. You'd think Oda would have a panel of her drawing a map at the end of each arc to show us that she's actively fulfilling her dream but you'd be wrong. The whole point of her traveling with the Strawhats is to help her friends achieve their goals and to achieve her own. So, instead of showing Nami actively achieving her goals, Oda simply writes about it in an SBS ""Of course she is. Her routine every day is to draw maps after dinner. As the story progresses during the day, she has to give sailing instructions as the navigator, so there's a lot she has to do out on the deck."" All we need is one tiny tiny panel at the end of each arc showing Nami adding Islands and locations to her map but her dreams don't matter. Zoro's goal of becoming the greatest swordsman: The way you become the best swordsman in the OP world is to do what Mihawk does and travel around the world fighting swordsmen. Zoro has rarely fought any swordsmen post time skip; he had a little skirmish with Fujitora, he had a fight with killer who's kind of a swordsmen, he ""fought"" Hyouzou and that's about it. We were shown how you become the world's greatest swordsmen through Mihawk yet Zoro never has actual, life and death sword duels with swordsmen anymore. How can I take him wanting to become the best at his craft serious when he never challenges others who are on a similar level or stronger than he is at said craft? Even in Wano, a land filled to the brim with samurai, Zoro never actually fights any of them. If I'm leaving out any fights Zoro has has had with any actual swordsmen post time skip, please let me know in the comment section. Chopper is a mascot now: Chopper has always been cute but would transform into a more serious form when using his transformations. Now, Chopper is just cute. Even his transformations are just adorable. The pre timeskip joke was the world government treating him as the Strawhats pet but now he actually feels like the Strawhats pet. His original personality has been replaced with a cute, cuddly, ""kawaii"" persona. Oda also doesn't really focus on his dream of curing every sickness in the world, he simply gives him people to treat each arc which is better than some of the other SH's. It'd be nice if we saw Chopper in his lab each arc working on actual medicine that can cure all illnesses but we never do. Usopp repeats character development each arc: Usopp's character development each arc is the same. He's afraid of going to an island, he gets into dangerous situations on said Island, he pussies out, he commits an act of bravery then he repeats this process in the next arc. Are we still supposed to believe Usopp is a coward at this point? He stood up against the world government, he regularly fights enemies many times stronger than he is, he trained on a dangerous Island for two years and he travels with notorious pirates on a daily basis. I get the irony of it but it's still redundant which is another issue with the story as a whole. Recycled plots: Almost every arc has the same structure. Luffy and crew goes to an Island, that Island's residents are oppressed by a king or ruler (Kaido, Doflamingo, Arlong, Crocodile, Big Mom, Enel, etc), Luffy vows to take down the big bad, Luffy fights the big bad and loses, Luffy gets separated from the crew, the crew has their fights with the Big Bad's minions, Luffy comes back into the story then ultimately defeats the big bad or at least wins a victory somehow. Very few arcs go outside of this general formula and it becomes repetitive after 900 chapters. P.S. I could talk about how Sanji is basically a gag character at this point, how Whitebeard not reaching out to Oden makes no sense, how Robin truly is just fanservice who occasional reads poneglyphs, how Oda has a habit of ""killing"" characters then bringing them back to life which is bad writing, how Big Mom is a meme or how Kozuki Toki's whole character was pointless but It'd take me forever to detail each issue. The point of my original post was to ask the question ""why can every other shonen be criticised but not One Piece""? There's tons of videos and posts criticising dragon ball, Bleach, Black Clover and Naruto. There's tons of posts on this sub criticising hxh and My Hero Academia for example but One Piece seems to be off limits for some reason. Is One piece just perfectly written so every criticism of it is invalid or is the One Piece fandom incapable of accepting criticism.",3,Not Recommended,"Jul 8, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_381641e462,3
"Story For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. Animation Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. Music Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). Characters Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. Overall Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time whereOne Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.",8,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eadd5f72cc,3
"The spiritual succesor to Dragon Ball (the original series), One Piece combines unforgettable cartoon visuals with knokout fight scenes and an epic plot Akira Toriyama never aspired to. In a fantastic world of vast seas, teenage Monkey D. Luffy-possibly the most cheerfully stubborn shonen anime caracter ever-yearns to raise a crew, become the King of the Pirates, and find One Piece, a legendary lost treasure. His special ability is the power to stretch like rubber, used mostly to beat up opponents, his special weakness is that, thanks to the same magic fruit that gave him strechy powers,he can never swim. the art gradually growing more detailed as the series gose on. The plot is set up like an RPG, as Luffy and his companions sail into a new area, become involved in the local troubles, fight the bad guys, and move on. Within this rough formula, however, grand plot threads are laid, and with each episode the world of One Piece becomes richer and more glorious: a tall-tale world of sea monsters, faraway kingdoms, cloud island, and superpowered pirates of every shape, size, and description. The mood is sheer over the top melodrama, every line is weeping, laughing, or shouting said with enough winking humor to be enjoyed by jaded hipsters as well as kids. The series is notable for its incredibly bloody and intense fight scenes in wich, however no one ever dies.

"Considered by some to be the heir to the throne of Dragon Ball in terms of Japanese market penetration, One Piece is certainly a phenomenon. The manga's print run recently outpaced Dragon Ball and the series, at more than 130 episodes, is still going strong. It's easy to see why; One Piece follows a very simple and very successful shonen action formula. It worked in the past for Rurouni Kenshin and Dragon Ball and it's working wonderfully for One Piece. The premise is pretty basic. Luffy D. Monkey, an irrepressible youth, ate the Devil's Fruit, which gave his body extra-strength elasticity. He's searching for the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will make him the King of all Pirates and finally allow him to prove himself to his childhood idol, a selfless pirate by the name of Shanks. Along the way, he collects an army of somewhat freakish rogues, including a tough swordfighter named Zoro who fights with a sword in his mouth, and Nami, a spunky thief. Together they have wacky adventures, beat up the bad guys, and collect treasure. It all sounds pretty harmless, right? Well, right, it is. One Piece is completely harmless entertainment. The battles can be surprisingly brutal at times, but overall, this is pure shonen action entertainment. It is entirely unpretentious and knows exactly what it wants to be, and excels at that. That having been said, One Piece is not a particularly deep show, although the characters are well developed. The focus seems to be on the crazy villains and the endless string of fights the main characters go through. Luffy and his crew of misfits go from town to town, saving the repressed masses and eliminating evil pirates who stand between them and the One Piece. In some ways, it's very reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin and Luffy are both laid-back badasses with hearts of gold that surround themselves with surprisingly capable outcasts and defeat circus freak-style enemies in episode after episode. If you like that sort of thing, One Piece delivers. If you don't, One Piece is going to bore the faith out of you. So, for fans of formulaic action shows, One Piece is a well-animated bit of fluff that sports decent music and some well-done action scenes. Unfortunately, the bizarre character designs are sure to turn a lot of folks off. One Piece is not done in a traditional anime style. It's very unique and it's bound to rub some people the wrong way. Otherwise, if you like your anime rife with fight scenes that last several episodes, declaratory statements (“Ore wa Kaizokuo ni naru da!” or “I will become the Pirate King!” is Luffy's favorite thing to say...), screwball humor and a touch of originality, One Piece will not fail to please.",10,Recommended,"Jun 13, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eee156647d,3
"As Hayao Miyazaki said, ""characters who never change are not interesting."" One Piece since the beginning of the timeskip has been a good example of that. For a while it was a flawed but phenomenal adventure that delighted partially by being unpredictable, while building dramatic momentum, the bonds of friendship, crafting a beautiful paradox of dark and goofy in its universe and making it credible enough that a five -year old minded spoiled brat would be capable of becoming the king of the high seas. Luffy is kind of the Tom Cruise of anime characters. He is small but he seems bigger because he is capable of specatular stunts, he has a trememnous s**t eating grin which was cute (for a while) and he is a little naive. And he has a great crew. They are the kind of characters you fall in love with, but falling in love is always a superficial experience. When you stand back you realize that they are all stereotypes; the coward, the alcoholic, the womanizer, the hunk, the perverted grandpa. The only character that resembles a real human being is Robin, who is so silently compelling that she should have been the start of the series. The crew go their separate ways for two years after about 500 episodes. Luffy hides away on an Island to train with a sensei in the art of Haki, much like Luke learns the force from yoda. Unfortunately he gains all of the action figure benefits of the training but none of the wisdom. Right from the moment Luffy reunites with his crew, not as a commanding captain, but like a little brother who is seeing his older brothers and sisters, the ship called ONE PIECE was sinking. The universe has gotten too big for Luffy to NOT grow up. His immature tendencies are no longer entertaining. Rather than make him a character, Oda is content to leave him as a formula: he is tacky during funny scenes and aggressive and supposedly sincere during action scenes. That sincerity feels phoney now, simply because it is not in the nature of the person that Luffy is. It is as phoney as Donald Trump's ridiculous promises to America, painting an illusion of a utopia. A show about a candidate for a pirate king needs a strong character for a protagonist, not a sketch of a kid. Now this wouldn't be a problem if the show were purely comedy, but no it also want to be a heavy drama at times too, and Oda's ambitions have gone beyond his ability to write them well. As a drama, The tonal shifts are so inconsistent. Sometimes it is played as farce, and sometimes it is played more sincerely. More often than not though, the darker subplots involving themes like genocide are done very two dimensionally, and they tend to serve messages that are very glib and lead to backwards minded sequences. Robin (for example) is an adult from a dramatic world who becomes a disney-derivative damsel in distress at one point, and her prince charming are kids from a comedic one. This is just one of many examples of Oda destroying the integrity of his characters by being too condescending of them. He makes the mistake of thinking that in order to make a character sympathetic he has to make them seem childlike in innocence. such is the case with characters like Luffy's brother Ace, who goes from a bad ass to a crybaby. Indeed some of Oda's philosophy is a complete insult to our intelligence, No subtly at all, and the emotional scenes are always breastfed to us. The Devil fruit concept was cute at first, but now it's just silly, like an idea stolen from a video game. There are too many fruits, yielding too many powers and likewise, there are too many characters in the universe. Some of them, in fact most of them have become far more interesting than Luffy, and his pals at this point. Since the timeskip, the Strawhat pirates have become increasingly less compelling and intimidating, and are now a bunch of pansies in silly costumes. We don't really see an increase in their straight because the antagonists are always two steps ahead of them in strength, when they should be more like 1 step ahead. As a result the fights all feel like recycled sequences. One Piece is a show that has gone on too long and yet disputed the distance we have travelled, it feels like we have gone nowhere.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_883f0e2015,3
"The perfect example of Quantity over Quality, both in characters, arcs, episodes, everything. Being a part of the big 3, and considering it's popularity and rating, it was to expect better, instead it is just a (long) waste of time. Under a promise of ""it gets better"", I watched 500+ episodes and it never did. As much popular as the show is, it tries to milk as much of the property as possible, and it shows how strict the schedule of publishing manga is considering how bad it is. Characters: Over the million characters it has, focusing on the main crew, they all give the illusion of being good characters considering the eternity you have with them, but they just have a typical sad backstory, and remain pretty 1 dimensional throughout the rest (the female ones being used just for sex appeal) growing only on power level and fighting abilities. The rest of the characters are as good as their designs: appalling and ugly, which is expected considering there's a million of them. Main Character: Receives it's own category by how terrible it is, the show treats him being a jerk to others for no reason as a joke, his humor is being vulgar, and there is no stakes to his elastic plot armor. He has terrible morals that only benefit him, and forces them into others by screaming, shouting, or punching while screaming louder. It makes a truly obnoxious character hard to root for, even when sometimes bad happens, not to him, but to others he cares about, there is no compansion felt since he also has no compasion for others. None of his fights were enjoyable for that. Story: What is does well is World Building, since it's expected considering how many episodes they have for that. Every arc has it's own location with it's own rules, which should be a positive point, however the payoff at the end of each arc is non-existent, it always ends in a easy battle to the plot-armor of the MC, or plot-convinience occurence whenever the situation gets rough. The loop is getting 40 or 50 episodes dedicated for build-up and antecipation to always end in a lousy and predictable way, and hope the next arc to be better (which it never is). The milking on the series is so bad that, besides having fillers (which are unwatchably bad), it also has entire arcs disguised as fillers which contribute nothing to the overall plot, streching it as much as possible. Animation: Cut all the corners, re-used animations, recaps, some seasons with 3 minute openings, we have 1000+ episodes and not more of 10 mins of quality. Fanbase: It gets the award of being the worst in all anime community, considering they have to dedicate so much of their times on this anime alone, it is all they can talk about, and trash on every other anime that gets popular, they have a mentality that only allows them to like 1piece and hate on everything else. In conclusion: There is no reason to watch this besides knowing how NOT to do storytelling, besides world building there is nothing of value here, it is a good thing that its sheer amount of episodes discourages people from watching it to watch better shows instead.",1,Not Recommended,"Feb 2, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7545d1c3ff,3
"One Piece is superb in MANY ways. The quality of both storyline, and production for this series was leaps and bounds over almost any other. Although I admit the artwork for a long stride of the series was only adequate, the epic storyline full of ambition, unique and enjoyable fight scenes, and a display of some of the most unique and down right amazing characters keeps this Anime at the top of the charts. The depth of the plot really only grows throughout the series, and the fact that you only get more interested as time goes on just goes to show how they've managed to last 408 episodes thus far(with many more to go). Their are two other great aspects to this, and many of my other favorite Anime, that should be touched on. The power-scale of One Piece is by far one of the most balanced and in check I've ever seen. Each character displays his or her own powers or unique abilities/traits without the sense of repetition. The second ""great aspect"" to the series is the party-up fashion the story takes. I personally LOVE when an Anime starts with a main character and as the events unfold they establish connections with others and for one reason or another unite. One Piece IMO has encompassed this in their storyline better than any other Anime. However other examples include Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is the dubbed version. In Summation, for those of you that don't mind subtitles One Piece is a top notch Anime that shows great fight scenes, in depth characters, and a plot that will keep you marking your calendars for the release date of the next episode.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b1da43b5cb,3
"I used to fall into the trap of &quot;The 4Kids dub = One Piece&quot;, so I figured One Piece was some totally lame series that only appealed to little kids. I actually got into One Piece after visiting a crack community on LiveJournal (capslock_op). I decided to check it out, but I was hesitant. Then, I ended up reading volumes 1-14 in under a month! (I know I'm reviewing the anime, but I read the manga first.) One Piece has very believable characters. The main crew members all have very real, very believable personalities. The storyline is interesting and easy to follow--hardly anything ever goes unexplained, so there are no loose ends or awkward plot holes (which is a problem I encountered with Bleach.) It has a great balance of humorous and serious moments. A lot of people seem to complain about the art style being &quot;bad&quot;, but I don't think that's the case. I think that One Piece's art style is appropriate for the mood and style of the series itself. It's entertaining and a little bit goofy. If One Piece's art style were &quot;better&quot;, it wouldn't be the same. Sure, sometimes there are some really oddly drawn frames, but the bulk of the animation is pretty good. Even some of the &quot;better&quot; animations have their &quot;wtf?&quot; moments.",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a4449119fa,3
"You'll either love it or hate it. There is no in between. The time is The Great Pirate Era. To find the treasure the legendary pirate Gol D. Roger left behind, One Piece, countless pirates have endured death. The boy who ate the Rubber fruit, Monkey D. Luffy, set out to the seas with the Pirate King as his goal. On his way, Luffy has met countless comrades. Today, they continue to sail through the greatest sea of all: The Grand Line. Accompanied by great soundtracks, Monkey D. Luffy and his nakama sail across the world. As they fight corrupt governments, bounty hunters or other pirates, they meet new friends, develop their character and occasionally give the viewer some comedic relief. The art may not be outstanding. Since the anime is catching up to the manga. there is some filler along the way and the recaps and previews are getting longer. So what? If you find comedy, fighting, music and character development in anime more important than anything else, you won't mind those small details. This is truly shounen as it should be. Note: I strongly recommend you watch the subbed version.

"The One Piece anime is a lot like Berserk (2016), yeah it looks terrible, and is badly animated, but it's still One Piece. I've been watching this loveable train wreck for almost twenty years, and I have to admit, I don't understand people who decide to watch this now that it's over 1000 episodes in. It takes 17 uninterrupted days to watch this, who has the time? Toei may be the bain of my ability to watch anime. Slam Dunk and Dragonball, both are great manga with terrible adaptions. One Piece is a pretty good manga with an even worse adaption then the aforementioned Toei disappointments. And what are the shared issues between all three, that cause them to be poor adaptions? The horrible weekly schedule, which leads to poor direction, bad pacing and terrible production values. Arcs get dragged out for ludicrous amounts of time, deflating the tension week by week as we wait for something to happen. Story: it's One Piece, it's looney tunes lord of the rings for kids and their families. I'm generally fond of the story, I mean I haven't stopped watching it yet. Characters: due to its length, One Piece characters do tend to feel very static, but they're charming enough to usually get you through whatever meandering plot thread is being covered in the episode you're watching (and the subsequent 20 that plot will run through). Themes: don't trust the government kids, treasure your friends and help out when you can. Good simple themes to teach kids and remind adults about. Animation: AHAHAHAHAHA.....it varies wildly, arc to arc, episode to episode... shot to shot..... Overall, it's pretty bad. Music: It's an anime by toei, you're going to hear the same 5 pieces of incidental music so many times that they will be permanently etched into your brain. Pacing: Luffy fought Kaido on the roof on Onigashima for over a year....... as a child, I thought those five minutes it took Namek to explode felt like forever, but that was only five episodes. Why is toei doing this to us? (So that TV tokyo's ad revenue isn't devalued during One Piece's time slot) In the end, do I think One Piece is worth it? I guess, if you've been watching it for decades, or if you want to share it with your particularly patient offspring. But it feels like a cheap product, made to broaden the reach of One Piece's market saturation, allowing the production committee to make even more money.And that just feels hollow. I'm looking forward to the remake, hopefully it addresses my issues and let's people who are intimidated by the length try out the series. But in the mean while, if you want to try out One Piece, just watch the live action show or read the manga.",4,Not Recommended,"Feb 13, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d50acbfc04,3
"I created an account just so that I could write this review. I started watching One Piece four or five years ago, and still find myself moved by this amazing series. I have seen and enjoyed many anime, from Gintama, to Death Note, to Legend of Galactic Heroes, to Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, a plethora of Gundams, and many others. One Piece has something that none of them have. In fact, One Piece has something that perhaps no other form of motion picture entertainment today has: rock-solid, consistently good writing. Good writing is hard to find, but good writing that can stay consistent and true to a massive overarching storyline through 500+ episodes? At first glance, One Piece presents itself as superficial, formulaic, light-hearted fun, but then it catches you off-guard with its depth of character, its surprising plot twists, its amazingly complicated and well-developed world, and its wisdom into the desires of the human heart. It lulls you into thinking you've figured it out, and then surprises you yet again. Plot threads left dangling for hundreds of episodes suddenly become significant again and seamlessly weave themselves back into the storyline, and you realize that you are viewing a grandly designed epic that is genuinely designed to span years. I have seen far too many shows that start off great, and then reach a point where the author or writers start floundering around and basically start just making the plot up as they go along. *Cough*Cough*Bleach*Cough*Naruto*Cough*LOST,DEAR GOD LOST*Cough. Not so with One Piece. Every story arc fits into place in a larger tapestry of the main plotline, and does so in some amazingly imaginative ways. In terms of artwork, One Piece certainly can be strange, but overall it contains some of the most original and fantastic locations and character designs you will ever see, anywhere. In terms of animation, it does occasionally suffer from the fluctuating quality levels that most long-running series have. The pacing is good, in general, although there are a few times where it feels like certain events are dragged out a bit longer than necessary, although it never reaches Dragonball Z-like proportions. Many of the of the arcs feel like they slow down right before the big conclusion, but in a way this only heightens the emotion at the conclusion of each arc. And believe me, every arc has a powerful climax. The music is fantastic, although noticeably repeated. It's difficult to have original music for 500 episodes, after all, and it's only to be expected. Many of the tunes are very catchy, though, and I love how main characters are associated with particular themes in true Wagnerian fashion. The characters are the best part of the show, and I would rate this anime higher than 10 for character if possible. They are all fantastically written, both amusing and bad-ass, and tremendously consistent in personality. The Japanese voice acting for them is also utterly perfect, and while I admit some other anime dubs are decent, I highly recommend watching this one in the original language. One Piece never fails to move me emotionally, and always in a positive way, leaving me feeling better about life in general. Paraphrasing something Luffy said once, ""As long as you are alive, something good can happen to you."" I started watching this show with my friends years ago, and I will treasure that time spent, both as a reminder of some good times I shared, and because One Piece is simply an amazing journey. - Happy Sailing",10,Recommended,"Jun 4, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cd3c7787fd,3
"Hands down, the best anime I have ever seen! Story is about a boy, Monkey D. Luffy who is aiming to become the Pirate king. On his way there he will need to conquer the sea, and meet up many new friends and ofc - Nakama. The everything is okay at first, but as anime progresses, story grows up to amazing proportions! I don't want to spoil all the great fun you could enjoy by watching it so i'l just give a few rates. Story: 9 - Pretty simple thing grows into something much wider and interesting, deserves the grade rightfully Sound: 9 - Great sound effects displayed through the series, even has few of it own songs (for instance ""Bink's sake"", really great one), and great sound effects. Characters: pure 10 - The crew meet up a whole bunch of characters, that are again - unique. I think that One piece has the richest line up of characters of all animes i watched,heard about or will watch in the future. And again nearly all of them played or will play, big or small role in the series. Enjoyment - Pure 10, as somewhat fan of anime, and BIG fan of pirates, I would personally give it 30/10, but that grade isn't available :D Even the ones that aren't necesserily fans of pirates/pirate era, will again like this series in some other way, because its simply flawless! Overall - Pure 10/10! P.S. As someone who experienced it, as well as many of other people as I heard, I must say from critic view that old ""4kids"" english dub did a pretty lousy job, poor voice acting and a lot of erased stuff. I almost dropped the series on episode 2 because of it. Back then I strictly watched DUBBED series, but I figured it would be a waste not to try, and tried out SUBBED version of the series, and I must say that I was STUNNED by a drastic change of the quality and enjoyment. So I just kept going on and on with the series, catching up in a really short period of time. I heard that ""Funimation"" started doing the job all the way from the start, in uncut version. Haven't seen it so I can't say anything on that subject, but I suggest you try SUBBED version anyway, after all it's original :))) My first review, hope it helps!",10,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e5016f29bb,3
"One Piece is a fun show, plain and simple. Normally, I'm all about serious, intelligent anime, but One Piece is my big exception. There are a lot of good, high class shows out there worth watching for the artistic value. But we can't forget the main purpose anime is designed for: entertainment. And when it comes to pure, non-thought-provoking entertainment, it's hard to beat a kid literally made out of rubber beating the crap out of a clown who can disassemble himself. (And that's just Season One! There's much crazier stuff than that.) What I love about One Piece is that it never even tries to be serious. The characters are all zany, yet they remain engaging enough to hold the attention of someone like me who looks for something with a little more substance than your average kid's show. New main characters are gradually introduced throughout the series, and each one makes a meaningful contibution. Most of these characters are added when Luffy, the self-appointed captain of this crew, randomly decides he likes them and wants them to come along which adds to the silliness. Another aspect of this show that sets it apart from the rest of the shounen action crowd is the consistency of the characters abilities. The members of the Straw Hat Crew are never forced to undergo some random quantum leap in power level in order to defeat their enemies. This means that despite the fact that the show is currently almost 350 episodes in length, none of the characters have experienced the continuous exponential increase in power seen in other shows that would otherwise give them the abilities of Superman by this point. Despite the length of the series, the material for each new episode is usually fresh, with a surprisingly small amount of filler and recap (though it does have some.) The action moves along fast enough that each new episode is simultaneously satisfying, yet leaves the viewer looking forward to the next one. I'd say the main weakness of the show is the tendency to crank up the cheesiness factor just a little beyond my tolerance point on occasion. Other viewers could be affected by this to a greater or lesser extent than I am; it's really all a matter of personal preference. One other disclaimer: do not watch the 4kids dubbed version. Just about any fansub is better, since the dub is censored and material is removed to such an extent that the quality is adversely affected.",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_80264f8984,3
"To say it simply my rating continued to drop from being 9 to now 2 over the years. This show turned from a fun, funny and interesting show to a complete disappointment.

"Before watching One Piece I was skeptical of watching it. It was one of the most popular animes out there but it just did not look like my sort of thing. Eventually my friend who got into anime started watching it and told me of its greatness, but I was still put off it. Finally after nagging me to watch it I caved in and started. I am glad that happened as it has to be one of my favourite anime's ever! Story (10) The story at first may sound simple. A young pirate sets out to find a crew and the lost treasure of one piece, although it quickly becomes more and more complex with all the stories of each character to the individual arcs. Oda has created a huge world like no other. Simply amazing. Art (9) The art at the start of One Piece may not look that great but that's because it was made in 2000. The art gradually gets better and throughout the 400+ episodes it starts to get amazing. Everything is thoroughly detailed. Sound (10) I loved the opening and endings to the anime aswell as the sounds that the characters make when they are doing their special moves. It makes the anime come alive. Character (10) One pieces characters are revolutionary. They are detailed in both art and story. The back stories of each character and their personalities are amazing. Enjoyment (10) One piece was a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs. Places when I would be in stiches from laughing or tearing up in some of the emotional episodes. One piece has everything in it from Comedy to drama to a bit of romance. I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish. I nearly went 24 hrs watching episode after episode since It kept me wanting more. Overall (10) Overall I would rate this anime a 10/10 simply because it is unbelievable. I am glad that I gave this anime a chance and would thank my frend for introducing it. It is probably my favourite anime right now",10,Recommended,"Aug 20, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_041d70847f,3
"i've been a fan of this serie since a lot of years ago. I dropped the anime when it started the previous saga to the actual one (punk Hazard, i guess), that means that i hav not seen a single chapter in three years. This series could be a very huge one, but it has some negative things. - the development of the plot lacks completely of fluency. The narrative of the chapters got worse, more or less since... Fisherman Island. Oda is obsesed about telling what is doing every strawhat, and that it's quite tiring. If you substract the op, the ending, and the resume, the chapter will get reduced to 10 minutes. Surprise! It won't happen anything in that time. The thing that names the chapter will happen at the last moment, so you'll have to wait another delicious week. -The obsesion of oda, of being always telling the past of the characters, olds and news. I found this aspect disgusting and pityful. Would not it be better, if you'd insinuate things about the character instead of let out all the information? It's horrible being in the middle of a great saga, and realize we have got involved in a 10-chapters flashback. I can understand it with the main characters, but Oda NEEDS TO DO IT WITH EVERY ONE. I DO NOT CARE ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THEIR LIVES. Those two aspects, made me take a little..... 3 years break. I don't know if i will see it again. The art has become poorer and poorer. Neves have been an important thing, but some of the last chapters i saw weren't very well animated. And the Tits of Namy and Robin looks like an universe in continue expansión. Those two used to be, 2 sexy chicks. That's only my humble opinion. It's still a nice series, but i can't follow it week by week. Or my pity and disgust will overpass me and i'll became a monster. Probably. However, in general is fine. Music can be very surprising, there are very epic moments (and there will be) and each time i listen ''we are'' i only can say..... that crap was good (in the good sense)",1,Not Recommended,"Dec 23, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f3c1cd5a0,3
"What could possibly be more exciting then being a pirate sailing the seas battling against other pirates, getting into ruffles with the government at the same time searching for new crew members and for the ultimate treasure? Sounds like an adventure eh? The surprising thing about One piece is that every small thing to the very detail is done to the finest level. I cant complain about any facet of this show and ill tell you why. One piece does everything surprisingly well, it possesses an entertaining story, with interesting characters and even mixes in intense drama which is huge since the show is a comedy first type show. One piece starts off with the main protagonist Luffy, one of the most ridiculous looking pirates ever, in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. This treasure was hidden somewhere in mysterious oceans known as the grand line by the greatest pirate in history Gold D. Rodger. Nearly every episode is hilarious as you watch this half-minded pirate do incredible things, meet incredible pirates and so on. For anyone who watches Action shonen animes like Naruto or Bleach, One piece actually does something better then those shows, it entertains fans nearly every episode(although a few fillers exist here and their, they are still quite entertaining) and it knows how to present a story with very fascinating characters. I&rsquo;m calling all anime fans to check out this great series but I would be doing you a disservice by not informing you of the fallowing: DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH SUBS. This show was introduced in Japanese and is excellent in its original without censorship. The American censorship attempts to water down the show for children by removing heavily violent scenes and explicit plots. The English voice actors are horrible as well&hellip; need I say more?

"I deserve a trophy. As of this writing, I have watched 577 episodes. At the very least I'm entitled to a ribbon for participation. Please excuse the satire, yet fully stated, following One Piece is a life decision you can't go back on. I've heard stories and things labeled as 'larger-than-life' from time to time, which as a literal thing is hard to imagine, and I'll tell you One Piece is larger than those things. If something truly is larger-than-life, as some frightful things are, it would lose recognizably, and have to appeal on upheaval or shock. One Piece is not larger than life. Hear me say, with all appeal, that One Piece delivers as large as life can. Now the life of a subject notwithstanding, there's the honest directive. One Piece is indeed huge. The manga has been serialized since 1997 and the anime airing since 1999. I'm amazed every time I'm reminded of this. Stories are rarely if ever allowed a life so long. Sense dictates the market at large would become bored, yet it marches on. I've only come to the series in 2010 myself, which is truly stunning both how long it took to finish and how it still converts so far into its lifespan. Shōnen giants have meritable criticism. Drawn out plots, dragging episodes, truly few bursts of action, and many disposable characters. It would be a bold-faced lie to claim that One Piece is an exception. The popular obeys popular formula. Only the contrarian will find problem with that and, besides, unimaginable popularity is not well-liked by the hipster generation. I once held One Piece to disdain. 4kids produced a very awful dub I saw on saturday mornings as a kid. Its huge popularity seemed unjustified to my closed eyes. A fan of something so huge and bland would likely be boring, a sheep coddled by peers and fearful of anything outside their comfort zone. Simple minded fans always exist, so do not take my elitist prejudice to heart. It's no quality I'm proud of. Winter break listlessly rolled by. I was a freshman in college and belatedly frustrated with my social situation. That may or may not matter. Animation has never been a focal point in my life, but I will always very much enjoy a good story. It doesn't matter where or how it comes to me - just if it reminds me of something, anything, important. There are infinite ways to look at life. I'll tell you why I watch animation to tell you why I finished One Piece, because it is the same. I was looking for something to burn out with, insomniac halfway into winter, my strength fissured into coping instead creating. That is when I want things to move in front of me instead of me moving them myself. What made me choose to start watching One Piece, and I mean definitively, I cannot say. I reasoned I deserved to give the show another chance - it was popular for a reason or something along those lines - but looking back there was nothing logical behind it. There isn't much logic to go around at three in the morning. I watched twenty episodes straight, ending at noon the next day. The show's whimsy and optimism - in a same line Luffy's childishness and excitement - kept me rapt during a dank time. It may have been a false attachment at first, but from Zoro's backstory forward I was in a combined state of excitement and satisfaction. Episodes turned like simple pages in a story, speeding forward until I reached an insane one hundred episode total. A long show spans a hundred episodes, but One Piece barely begins. In the middle of the Arabasta arc, some hundred episodes in, I actually had to justify and think about why I watched the show. Before then, watching continued effortlessly, just as only wanting to know what happens. Whether or not a story provokes such a feeling is only a trick of pacing and has nothing to do with quality. Eventually, everything becomes evaluated, and despite being bored with the Straw Hats wandering forever in the desert, I found it was not simple joy, excitement, or shameful pacing that held my attention, though they did help. It was the show's surprising depth, not only in character development, but the attention to detail put into the entire world. If you make it to the Water 7/Enies Lobby continual arcs, know that you've reached the single part of the story that enables me to say One Piece matches up to any great and peerless execution of storytelling. There are many stories with that honor, however, that makes it no less of a feat. Without giving much away, there is driving contention in the crew caused by a practical problem and a more sinister one. A new character's main reason for living intersects with one protagonist's main reason to die. An old protagonist finally succumbs to his lasting doubts and shadows, acting most shocking and out of character for the genre - but thankfully not the show. The main villians are inexplicable and hard to believe at first, yet after, and somehow because of, initial appearances, they are more than enough to drive the story forward. The many conflicts, subplots, and rapid changes make this story arc the most complex and rewarding in the series and allow me to recommend One Piece to anyone without a shadow of a doubt. I nearly quit in the second half of the Skypiea arc. It encompasses many of the bad points of the show - many bland characters outside the main cast (from Enel's wacky helpers to the clueless Conis), overkill pacing (Satori's ridiculous ""Trial of Balls"" lasted like four episodes), and few moments of excitement (Chopper had the only respectable fight and it was against a guy who would forget to open his mouth when speaking). However, snuck close to the end of the arc are three entirely wonderful episodes concerning a Montblanc Norland. They have nothing to do with the main plot - even occurring 400 years in the past from the main characters - and yet is of the greatest subplots One Piece has. The show had before convinced me of a world to breathe in, but somehow it had me interested in its history, even without a real pay off. Anything concerning a Gol D. Roger is even more exciting and equally removed from Luffy's quest, all to an extent. There aren't many stories where even its history remains interesting and convincing. If you haven't seen the show, I realize my review isn't being very accessible anymore. There is so much to cover when something is so long, so I know not to try to cover everything. One Piece truthfully remains very consistent throughout its entirety. Though many major plotlines have been boring or even poor from times, the show has never been dedicated to a major plot, or it would have ended by now. When others describe why they enjoy the show so much, many point to its character development, comedy, art style, and its densely woven plot. Especially liked is the very intense chekhov's army. Characters and concepts introduced anywhere in the show appear and reappear when it's appropriate (and many times even when it is not, such as Usopp befriending giants for no reason than knowing other giants), but appropriateness truly does not matter, for the directive is to make events connected, so that the characters live in a present represented by a real past. There is beauty in telling a story about a world, instead of only about characters, or only about a thing. To use a daft example, the Lord of the Rings has a fantastic reputation as a fantasy novel, maybe even recognized for the wrong reasons (thank hollywood). The Lord of the Rings is a post-modern epic and I mean that literally. I shall define an epic that lives in its folklore and obeys it completely, like a recognizable Greek epic The Odyssey. I want to believe the greatness of an epic is not totally reliant on its heroic characters, though they contribute greatly. A fantasy epic takes a picture of an impossible world and makes it a possibility. Those are the simplest terms, but it is not the act of creation that is important, it is the completeness. The world's culture, laws, & customs are obeyed naturally in the telling and the characters, while important, impact overall a small part in history. When I think of Lord of the Rings, I don't think too much of its band of heroes, the struggle of good versus evil, or the strength of good nature. For me what stays is how detailed the world is and how far Tolkien went. It is a story about Frodo and the Ring, and yet it is a world of so much more. One Piece can be called post-postmodern, if you're silly, because it is very much simple and bright instead of being grim and refined. Wouldbe epics try to be grim and defined. And wouldbe epics do not have a world I believe in, which is why they're only caricatures of the worlds around us. One Piece, at a certain point, became a true fantasy epic. It is a story about Luffy and finding One Piece, and yet it is a world of so much more. Everything surrounding the characters oozes with careful thought. One Piece no longer feels only like Luffy's story or just the story of the Straw Hat pirates but a recounting of history by the movers and makers themselves - a fictional history that feels so very real. I remember my cousin over and we were eating pizza. It was shortly into winter break. My hand was my plate, pizza doesn't need a plate, but he was holding a plate with pizza. Eating pizza, holding pizza, he looked liked he wanted to say something and didn't know how. The need to share won over the insecurity of sharing and he asked me if I ever heard of a show called One Piece. Call it coincidence, still, I had just watched Luffy's final fight with Crocodile and was able to express how much I liked the show. He was a bit farther, starting the Davy Back fights if I remember, and was very excited that the insecurity never existed. He was excited he had someone to share this world with, I'd guess. At first, when we talked about the show, we would focus on the main characters and talk about what fights we liked, what lines we liked, what backstories we most appreciated, and inevitably what characters were the best. Two years later, we have both finished the show, and end up talking about it when we see eachother, at least to discuss the most current episodes. Sometimes the discussion spills over when either mentions how much we like the show, or how such and such used to be better, or what arcs we loved and hated. Now when we talk about One Piece it could easily last hours - it is, after all, nearly 200 hours long - yet we do not focus on the main characters as we used to. A comparatively small part of our talks touches on the protagonists, partially because we both know them so well, mostly because we're talking about the world at large. One piece has a world you can picture, a world you can really talk about, a world to be excited for. I very much like stories, as I say, but it's hard to say flat things about a whole world. I very much like worlds too. It's different, to say the least, and despite any insipid moment, I believe One Piece is a world worthy of any others and is an absolute joy to experience.",9,Recommended,"Dec 19, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2145e56624,3
"One piece holds a special place in my heart, similar to how Bleach is for me because these two anime were the long running ones which I saw after watching Naruto and getting introduced to anime. One piece is seemingly just two words but if you'd ask me about how I describe this series then it would be just one word. Legendary! Initially before watching One piece, I was the type of person who like everyone else was daunted by the abysmal amount of episodes, I started One piece in 2015, and back then the episode count was around 500 or something like that. The story of what made me start One piece is a weird one as I was not compelled by something like the story or social media or something normal like that. What made me start watching one piece was, Believe it or not, It was Opening 14. I somehow saw that opening randonly on Youtube one day and it was so good that I started One piece not long after. Initially I binged the first 100 episodes but then took a few month break due to studies. Then I came back to watch it and the rest is history. Now let's move toward the review! Story : You cant find faults here, because there are none. It has everything, Action, Adventure, Mystery, Romance, Comedy, Politics, Dark side of society (Slavery), Prostitution etc. There's a reason why it has been running for 25+ years. It actually is the best selling manga in Japan, comparing with the likes of Superman or Batman comics and even beating their sales if I recall correctly. It's just such a wild and heartwarming journey which cant be explained in words. Characters : Every single character is unique , No two characters are the same. The cast is so so big and it keeps growing. The main strawhat group is one big family and makes me feel like I'm a part of their family aswell. Animation : Toei is infamous for the handling of the One piece anime. Poor pacing and dragging of an episode to the point of absurdity. But they've gotten better over the years definitely. They atleast did this story justice and continue to pour out episode after episode and lately their work in the Wano (Most recent arc at the time of writing this review) has been phenomenal. Soundtrack : Compliments the series so well, Every opening and ending is well crafted. Enjoyment : When you watch something for so long that it becomes a part of your life, kind of like what Naruto was for me. One piece is the same for me. Its still going on and I watch it weekly and have amazing and beautiful memories with it. If you truly have the will and time to invest for the amount of episodes, watching One piece wont let you down. Trust me. It is THE BEST anime probably and the day it ends will probably mark an end of an era and I hope Iam alive to witness that glorious historic occasion. Thanks for reading, Go watch and become a part of the Strawhats' journey.",10,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1bbcd5efb7,3
"i grew up with one piece and i will be genuine , at first the show was cool , the story was fun , the story pace and the characters interaction were good , the ARCs were sooo fun i dont remember getting bored at all but as i progressed towards the 700s episodes the story got ridiculous i even forgot their main objective , the episodes and the story pace got slow and it was boring and repetitive as well, from a shounen anime fan i will give this show credit for being good at first . i know some of you will say it will get good later BUT i dont want to watch and waste time throughout the boring episodes to reach the good one .",5,Not Recommended,"Jun 5, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4c0aa29032,4
"Initially I was wary of watching this popular shounen anime as I preferred shoujo or romance anime. I also thought the art was sort of wonky at first, but upon starting this show I was overwhelming pleased. The story and art are, for lack of better words, amazing. I began watching One Piece two months ago and caught up to the 455 episodes in that time and can't wait for more releases each week. Although OP is considered part of the Jump trifecta along with Naruto and Bleach it's really in a league of its own, far surpassing these two in enjoyment and story. Frankly, the others aren't worth watching at all. One Piece has amazing flow between episodes and VERY few filler arcs. Luffy is also one of the greatest main characters of all time and is supported by an amazing cast that really allows the viewer to understand One Piece's overarching theme of being ""nakama."" Even the secondary characters are extremely lovable. One Piece is definitely worth watching no matter what type of anime you are into. It definitely doesn't leave you disappointed.",10,Recommended,"Jun 18, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_59047757d0,4
"3 Simple words: BEST ANIME EVER !!! The big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, but to me, One Piece is the only big one. This one contains the least fillers of the big 3. Even tough every character gets introduced over a couple of episodes (in which you learn about their history and create a real connection), all eps are relevant to the series. Even episodes that look like fillers at 1st, get some part in the main story afterwards... A friend of mine said I had to watch this anime and he was right, so now I'll tell you the same, WATCH IT.",10,Recommended,"Aug 17, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bc9097a36c,4
"The Greatest Work of All Time One Piece is incomparable to any other story. You simply cannot compare a tale that has been building for 1,100+ episodes/chapters. These aren’t just episodes stacked on top of each other they are pieces meticulously planned by the author from the very beginning, all forming an intricate and cohesive narrative. Positives: - Cohesion: A grand tapestry continuously being woven together to form one final masterpiece. Nothing is random; everything is planned. Even the fights are structured so that no character is too strong or too weak, and no underpowered character holds a role that feels disproportionate to their strength or influence. - A story planned from the start: What happens in Episode 1 might not make full sense until Episode 452 and even then, your perspective will shift again at Episode 683. A simple drawing that seemed meaningless at first could turn out to be the cornerstone of the entire story 600 episodes later. - A living world: While Luffy is living his adventure, things are happening elsewhere in the world, leading to real consequences. Likewise, the crew’s actions impact the world around them. It doesn’t feel like we’re just following a protagonist—it’s like witnessing an entire ecosystem and global geopolitics unfold. - Countless plotlines and subplots: You’ll never run out of mysteries to explore or theories to debate in One Piece. - Unparalleled diversity: With over 1,000 named characters, islands, creatures, oceans, powers, and mysteries—all interconnected with their own stories, relationships, and secrets you’re guaranteed to have at least 10 favorite characters. - Incredible soundtrack. - Fantastic voice acting (as is often the case for anime in their original version). - An ever-improving animation quality despite the demanding weekly schedule. Negatives (unfortunately, there are some): - A sometimes slow pace, especially towards the end, due to the weekly release schedule stretching out episodes. - Story arcs can sometimes feel too similar. - Humor gets repetitive: The same jokes for 1,000 episodes can become tiring. - Too much focus on every crew member: While it's admirable that Oda wants to give every character their moment in each arc, it slows down the story at times. Final Verdict: The negatives I’ve mentioned are minor nitpicks compared to the overall quality of the series. You will never regret investing your time in One Piece.

"I've said this before. One Piece is one of those stories you'd write as a 12 year old, look back, have all kinds of good feelings, but realize it's a FAR cry from a real story. Some characters have amazing designs, pretty cool abilities, but the rest... nah. No character development, no story progression. Luffy doesn't question his actions once. Sure, he's hardened by the death of Ace, but at the end of the day, he's still the same Luffy you know from before right? He hasn't changed. Most characters don't change. Their goals remain the same, their ""never-ending adventure"" goes on, and the story doesn't leave you hints about what the one piece treasure could possibly be. In a sense, you can compare it to a cartoon like Scooby Doo. The gang's doing the same old shenanigans, just with Shonen tropes thrown in. Sabo has something that's akin to development, because you see how he was back then, then how he grows up, but I'd argue that's because Oda himself has admitted at a point that he doesn't know what the other characters are like in an interview besides what they do. For example, he knows Luffy would eat a piece of meat if it fell off the sky, and Zoro would slice it up, but, what else? People are human beings, not human doings. In a sense, you need to articulate real feelings to make them relatable. Anyone can write a death scene, it's the easiest thing to write. But that's because everyone experiences death somewhere somehow in their life at least once, and it can be from a person close to your heart or a complete stranger you just met. That's why I said Sabo is a prime example of he's kind of grown as a writer, in a sense that he's able to develop a character that goes through a certain state of change based on the circumstances given to him. That's why Oda focuses on building more places, more islands, more things to explore, because his world doesn't feel LIVED in, as in, it's like seeing something for the first time, but if you were to watch or read it again? What other depth is there? Does the character's power symbolize some kind of critical change and defining moments of character growth? If so, is it positive or negative? For example, Obito from Naruto. He sees Rin dies, and that's because he wasn't able to make it there in time, in fact he's always been kind of late to things his whole life. What's the Mangekyo that develops for him? Kamui. To transport himself anywhere, to make it in time. With Itachi, it's the fact that people around him made him question their worth, even his own clan, so Tsukuyomi, the ability to make people believe in illusions, and Amaterasu for him and Sasuke, for both want to burn those who have hurt them, with Sasuke even more so, because his other eye controls the flames to an even larger extent as his target isn't just hatred towards how he's been forced to act, but how the world around him robbed him of his entire family. You see the same thing with Nen in Hunter x Hunter. A person's aura and Nen ability is developed alongside how their characters have changed and the abilities grow and progress towards how their characters have changed as a person. This is most prevalent with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. A Stand goes through Acts 1-3, sometimes 4, signaling growth in the person's character, how they either gain confidence or falls. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Let me ask you this, if you stayed the same throughout your life without changing, do you think that's a good thing? And please don't give me the ""it's entertainment, it's not real life"", like no. Art is a form of self expression, in an essence, it is derived from real life experiences and emotions. If you had a friend who never learned their lessons despite the problems arising from their actions, would you still hang out with them knowing YOU could end up as collateral damage? This is why Flat characters RARELY work. No one in reality goes with changing. You aren't even the person you were yesterday let alone a few seconds ago. You aren't even breathing the same oxygen molecules you just did. Is there anyone you actually know in real life that remained the same? Nope. The character they play? Maybe it remains the same, but the inner person inside of them must have gone through some changes, am I right? Oda's usage of the Flat character trope is shallow at best, when it comes to literature. On the other hand, Yoshihiro Togashi uses the Flat character with Gon, and goes the length to deconstruct him, and build him back up. He's still a ""Flat"" character, but the way he goes about being one is entirely laced with deep nuances. It also doesn't help that One Piece is entirely a product that looks like the editorial team meddling with the work. It just looks, sounds, and feels like a product of business decisions, made to remain the same for the sake of being as recognizable over the years to make as much money as possible. In a sense, any artistic exploration is denied for the sake of being household milking cow. I have read the manga, surprisingly, up until the latest chapters. And, I'm also aware that every character is simply sinking into the idea of the characters embodying their philosophies. I am also aware of how different the manga and the anime are in regards to it's depiction. What I've argued is that there is no depth. And I know it is a thematic choice. That's specifically why I said it's something that looks like it came from a 12 year old who hasn't learned reality. I didn't say it was an inability, but I did say Oda doesn't give much thought to what each character would actually be feeling, beyond their beliefs and ideals. It is by no means, a higher art form. And it's fine being that way, but that means you gave up any thought of self improvement because you're fine with being who you are, even if realistically speaking, it's not a healthy way to be. See the reason why epic poems made sense and are considered higher art forms is because they were layered with nuances. One Piece is not. It tried to emulate it, but it ultimately isn't, even if it follows the same format. Also, might I add that being a ""Pirate King"" makes no sense? Being a pirate means you are free already, doing whatever you want, and for there to be a King, do you think that that plays into an ideology of what a pirate is? It's not the same thing as being Hokage. Luffy stated he doesn't want to be someone important, he just wants to be the Pirate King. But isn't the Pirate King an important person by title then? This is like a child saying he wants to be president, but he doesn't want to do anything important, he just wants to achieve the status and rank. I'm not saying it's wrong to dream, but at some point, the dream ends and reality begins. It's the epitome of strawman arguments, ironically, that's the title of his crew, the Straw Hats. Even epics write in stories about overcoming hardships, furthering ideologies, but they also highlight weak flaws inherent in the characters that can be reflected back to the human condition. Luffy, for all purposes, is a caricature of what characters like Goku are. Stupid, stubborn, strong, and have a certain charisma to them. With no explanations beyond those. He does not embody any weak flaw the human condition has to offer that can reflected back into the person viewing it, which is why I think it has no value beyond provoking imagination. Ideologies need to be questioned, even by one's self in order to reinforce it, not just go forward with it with no repercussions. Even Naruto learned this the hard way. Sure you can say characters don't need to develop and progress into something new, but that's basically making a show for kids that's actually meant for kids. Which is probably why it sells well. It does the Shonen trope by the books, and does nothing more. What's more boring than doing everything by the books, especially since there's a hundred of them out there JUST like that? The first ones you pick up might leave a special place in your heart, and I've remained with it just because it was something I picked up when I was young, but any reasonable adult will eventually realize that dreams do come to an end at some point. There is no meaning in a never ending story or dream. Good stories have an ending, because they offer lessons to be learnt. One Piece is subpar at best. And it's the king of it. The problem with Oda is his inability to portray them beyond that. At least in MHA, we got Stain and other villains who aren't really villains. With One Piece, it's clear as day if you have any logical comprehension skill who's on what side because Oda relies on the labels he created too damn much. Sure, characters can say they don't have an allegiance anywhere, but at the end of the day, you KNOW who they're going to side with and WHAT they will do. You KNEW Law would play the whole ""I'm your ally, but not really gonna join you, but I'm still somewhat of an ally"" trope just based on his design alone, by how unique it looks and what it says about the characters. Law wanting revenge of Doffy? Man, his backstory just reeks of Oda's usual ""oh look, character with tragic backstory."" Also, about Brooks? Yeah, A LOT of writers do that. They look back on their work or have an idea in mind about how to relate characters back to some other character they created. It's actually relatively as easy as ""this is my long lost brother"" character trope. My point has always been, does his character designs and powers say something about their psyche? The human conditioning they have? Are their relationships reflections of what each other lack? Is the relationship a metaphorical symbolism of some statement? In most cases, Oda doesn't even do this. Take Persona 5 the game for example. Each character manifests a Persona that is a reflection of their psyche based on Tarot cards, much like Stands were in the beginning of JoJo. They each represent some type of metaphor, straight down to their designs. One Piece has nothing on this. Just because someone does something to appease to a larger crowd doesn't mean it's any good. That's just settling for what you can get. What the public loves and what you yourself love is different to begin with. You go by Mob Mentality, rather than what you yourself think has value, you're doomed to be stuck an entertainer who can only entertain based on things you know the public loves, for example, juggling, performing circus acts, walking across a rope, all that stuff. It's all been seen before, and it offers nothing new.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 25, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9cf1b05758,4
"Let’s cut to the chase, this anime has a good concept but is horribly executed, it is entirely consistent of filler episodes and movies that don’t perform well as this show constantly keeps going and going never reaching the premise or point of things. At the end of the day its the same thing repeated all over again, a stupid adventure, dumb jokes some being sexual which are overall unfunny. This anime certainly does have a successful idea but at some point it just gets tiresome. It is not worth watching over 1000 episodes for, its filler, filler, filler, nothing more and nothing less. It is so slow and it is definitely for the money which infuriates me onto why people like it, it’s slow purposely I believe for money and they keep making more movies and shows instead of actually getting to the point.

"""I'm going to be the King of the Pirates and find the One Piece!"" -Monkey D. Luffy.... *goes on to never actually TRY to find the One Piece, and instead parties and goofs off in every arc possible. In fact, the only person in the crew searching for the literal title of the show is Nico Robin (best girl by the way).* Like many shows, One Piece has its good qualities and its bad ones...unfortunately, the bad qualities of this show heavily outweigh the good ones in my personal experience. Let's talk about the good qualities first: WorldBuilding (great): One Piece has one of the most intrisic worlds in animanga, and is not afraid to show it off. Oda-sensei did a fantastic job with his worldbuilding, although...he kind of has to considering it is a series focused on the adventure and journey. 9/10 That's it. That's the only good quality I could find. Now let's get into the rest: Characters (mixed): Characters are the biggest mechanism for a story to progress, and One Piece often fails to impress with its cast of characters. The main crew lacks any real character development outside of levelling up in power, and are only each given a sad backstory to satisfy the mark of attachment that readers and watchers can attain. After their backstory, they don't grow at all. They just have the same personality and quirks that we already saw from them in the beginning. The main character being stupid isn't new, but the level of stupidity he has is far too much that it isn't even funny. The comedy from the characters feels like it was written by a five-year old that goes around telling the same jokes because one person laughed at it before. The art style of the characters is ""unique"", but appalling to look at. Like seriously, what is up with their designs?! All in all, the characters are not terrible...but....to each their own I guess. 4/10 Pacing (horrendous): Lawd gawd, where do I begin with this one. Never in my years have I ever watched something so slowly paced to the point that i would dose off in the middle of the day....even if I genuinely HATE taking naps! This anime's pacing is BY FAR its biggest issue, as it takes filler material and adds it to the canon episodes instead of just leaving filler episodes seperate like Bleach and Naruto. If something like a shock factor happens, it will take years for Toei Animation to milk all of the reactions as much as possible from the people seeing it unfold, until finally deciding to carry on with the plot. On top of that, there are always tons of minutes allocated to recaps, making up for at least 5 minutes every damn time. I can understand that it is a weekly show, and that they do not want to catch up to the manga so that they can still have space to breathe...but enough is enough, they are simply ruining the show. You know it is bad when your show's fanbase has to literally create a seperate website where they fix the anime's pacing issues (onepace is the website I am speaking of by the way). 0/10, and that's being kind. Story (boring as hell): I'm sorry, but this story is boring as all hell. Luffy screams he want to be the pirate king once every 200 hundred episodes to the point that I forget that's even the point of the show. Majority of the time I keep assuming he just wants to party and goof off with his friends. He doesn't even give you a reason to follow him on his journey, he just screams and screams and people seem to love it. Naruto wants to become the hokage to earn people's respect, Asta wants to become the wizard king to prove people wrong, Luffy wants to become the pirate King because....when his brother/mentor talked about he thought it sounded cool. Wow. How inspiring. The arcs are repetive, it's just about the Straw Hats going to a random island, getting split up because...who even knows, Luffy encounters a princess or damsel in distress, Luffy fights the bad guy and loses, plot armor saves him, he comes back like a hero accompanied by his crew and he beats the bad guy while his crew beats the side villains. After saving the island, he jumps around like an idiot, eats meat, takes some treasure, and then leaves. Sound familiar? Yes...because it's the most basic plot structure you can ever find in a story. Not every arc is the same, but even the ones that are different end up being stupid as all hell. Such as Marineford where all of the pirates come to save one idiot that ends up forsaking all of their efforts just because of a ""yo daddy"" joke. The plot is HEAVILY dependant on the worldbuilding, which I believe often masks the eyes of fans from seeing how poorly written it is. Such as the comedy in Fairy Tail or the fights in Dragon Ball (I'm a Fairy Tail fan, I would know). All in all, the story doesn't inspire me, and that's that. But like I said, to each their own. 1/10 Animation/Quality (bad): The animation of the show isn't my biggest issue, but I do have to say that I do not find it appealing in all of the 700+ episodes I forced myself to watch. The fights feel stale, I've seen fanmade animations better than this stuff. That doesn't necessarily only go to the animations studio's issues, but also to the source material - no offense Oda-sensei, but I genuinely wish you could make better fights that have better tactics and stakes involved. The sound designs are also terrible, all I'm hearing is some type of horns and slow beats that sounds like a newly formed marching band at a high school game. For me, the intensity of the sound design in fights adds to the hype...and I certainly feel no hype whatsoever watching and listening to this show. 2/10, the impressive voice acting is the only reason I rated it higher than one Fanbase (worst of the worst): Even after everything mentioned, I don't necessarily hate One Piece at all. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I don't like being a negative person, I simply reciprocate emotions that are pushed onto me. So why am I making this review? BECAUSE OF THE GODFORSAKEN FANBASE! These people have somehow created a faction of worshippers to not only the show, but to the creator! They call him Goda. At first I thought it was cool that they would be so respectful to their favorite mangaka, but it's actually past the point of insanity! These people see NO wrong with the show whatsoever, to the point that if you don't like it, they will literally attack you for it! I've never seen a fanbase, not only in anime but throughout all of fiction, behave the way these people do. Making fun of a Boruto fan that passed away in an accident, mass downvoting on IMDB for Attack on Titan's highest rated episodes, slandering every anime fandom and their favorite anime if they don't have One Piece in their top 3 at the least...and many many more. They have even turned the idea of it being a kids show (which it is) into a philisophical masterpiece...because of what? Luffy embodying freedom? AS A PIRATE?! Luffy literally has higher IQ than these people, I kid you not. With all due respect to Goda, I mean Oda-sensei....One Piece is made even worse because of its fanbase, and I stand by that. Negative Infinity / 10 Overall, One Piece at one point almost made me quit anime because I used to believe that anime is specifically for weirdos, and used to make fun of anime watchers all the time. The pacing, the lack of motivation I feel, and the lack of entertainment I attained all made that point even more clear to me until my friend and sister forced me to watch Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia. I only kept watching more of it because of consistent harrassment from One Piece fans on my Tiktok page, as they said I have no reason to not like it if I haven't ""watched enough of it"". Now that I have, I simply ""don't understand it"". I'm tired of this show, and even more so its fans. So if you are reading this...do yourself a favor, and stay away from this show. Even if you even up likiing it, I would hate to see more people added into that shameful fanbase.",2,Not Recommended,"Sep 20, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7c71cfa6bb,4
"One Piece is one of the three kings of Shounen. This is an undisputed fact. The anime started back in 2000 (the manga in 1997), and has been going strong for over 10 years now. Given that, I think it's fair to say that if nothing more, something's gotta be going right for it to last that long. Now I, like everyone else who has reviewed the show, am giving it a 10, a rave review, and overall I've lopped off one of my fingers and replaced it with a thumb, solely to gain the ability of giving this show 3 thumbs up. But understand, I've re-watched this series from the beginning 4 times now, and read through the manga twice. I know One Piece inside and out, and I'm not here to simply rave. I'm here to give it a fair review. Shounen Syndrome is an anime infection with symptoms ranging from over-exposed attack explanations to lengthy conversations where they aren't necessary to horrendous filler arcs and even all the way to episode recaps that take up a good quarter of the time the episode is alloted. One Piece is not immune to this. No attack can simply go unnamed, or unexplained. Though they'll only explain it once, and it's usually not as horrible as it sounds. Though One Piece is in an interesting position in that they know it's ridiculous. The joking nature of the characters often brings up the ""It's not cool if it doesn't have a cool name"" mentality. So you could let One Piece off the hook to some extent, as it almost satirizes the rest of shounen by participating. One Piece also did something I'm not a big fan of. Starting around episode 300, they started using opening themes that lasted a full 2 and a half minutes. Followed by 30 seconds of intro, and then 30 seconds - 3 minutes of recap. Sometimes you'll have to start watching 6 minutes into the episode to actually get to new content. But this is both a blessing and a curse. For you see, One Piece filler tends to be pretty horrible. So, around episode 300, they upped the animation quality for widescreen TV. And to be able to put out this quality animation once a week, a shorter episode time makes the jobs of the animators easier, and production more cost effective. This meant a more quality product, in shorter spurts. The shorter spurts however, contribute to less filler. And for this reason alone, the reduced episode time and long recaps are in fact a blessing for One Piece fans. Though not many would know it. So what about the actual show? I'll assume if you're on this page, you already know a bit about One Piece. It's a show following the adventures of Monkey D Luffy and his ragtag crew of pirates searching for the great treasure ""One Piece,"" with the ambition of becoming the Pirate King (the one who rules over the greatest seas of the world). The story is solid, and has only been better developed over time. Oda has done something wonderful, in that he had his story planned out long before it got there, and it seems he's having even more fun with One Piece now than at the start of his career. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment factor One Piece provides. The art style is the biggest complaint I've heard about One Piece. A lot of people have told me they just flat out disliked the art style, and that was one of the biggest reasons they didn't want to watch the show. Though I can't understand this, I guess One Piece's art style is more cartoony than most anime. But that art style reflects the values of the series. It IS cartoony, in spirit. That's kind of the point. That being said, if that's not your thing, I can respect that. The other thing to mention about the animation is that it's been going since the year 2000. As such, earlier episodes definitely aren't up to snuff in terms of animation quality, especially as it's a shounen with a budget. But as the series and time progressed, the animation quality progressed as well and is now very well done. By far though, the characters in One Piece are what you enjoy the most. Luffy is your typical anime shounen, the kind of guy you can't help but love. He's simplistic and dim-witted, but his heart's in the right place and that's what sticks. Everyone is well written and typed, and the character development throughout the series is rather impressive. New synergies arise that both reflect Oda slipping into a more comfortable mindset whilst writing his character's parts, and the characters themselves becoming more accustomed to each other. Overall, One Piece has been going 10 years. And in those 10 years, the crew has grown up and developed with it's audience. Even given it's Shounen faults, it still does an absolutely wonderful job of story telling and entertaining. The main point I would bring up is never watch the 4kids dub. It's not One Piece. If there was one example I could provide to convince you of this, they turned a french chef into a brooklyn accented disaster... smoking a lollipop. That is One Piece. My most timeless anime. It's an experience I would recommend to any and all anime fans, though I know it may not be a good fit for many.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a8d79f6a7e,4
"""One Piece – A Journey Worth Every Second"" One Piece isn’t just an anime—it’s an experience. What starts as a simple pirate adventure quickly turns into one of the most incredible stories ever told. The world is massive, the characters feel real, and the emotional moments hit harder than you'd expect. Luffy and the Straw Hats aren’t just a crew—they feel like family. Each character has their own dreams and struggles, and watching them grow over time is one of the best parts of the series. The world-building is on another level, with every island, faction, and mystery tying together in ways that make you realize just how much thought has gone into it. At over 1,000 episodes, it might seem overwhelming, but that’s what makes it special. Every arc adds something new, and the payoffs for long-running storylines are unbelievably satisfying. The humor, the fights, the emotional gut punches—it’s all perfectly balanced. And with the Wano arc’s insane animation, One Piece is better than ever. If you’re looking for an anime that sticks with you long after you’ve watched it, this is it. Once you set sail with the Straw Hats, there’s no turning back. Waiting for the return of the Straw Hats after the long break!! Rating: 10/10 – A masterpiece that only gets better with time.",10,Recommended,"Apr 2, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a6470d748b,4
"In short One piece has been beating a dead horse for about a decade now I see quite a bit of overhyped fans on here, I'm afraid it's just anywhere close to the hype anymore. Lets start with the story. Story. 1/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Ridiculous Pirates go on Ridiculous adventures is how I would sum it up, add in a couple of cheap laughs and cheap emotional segments and you have summed one piece up. Art. 2/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. Enjoyment. 3/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... overall this series has been dragged on way too long, and for me personally has lost it's appeal long ago, I just had to drop it. However every now and then I will watch it on Toonami for a few cheap laughs other than that i highly recommend you stay away from this anime it just is way to over hyped and they are just beating a dead horse at this point.",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 17, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a946d52892,4
"One Piece, originally a manga written by the genius Eiichiro Oda, was adapted into an anime in 1999. Both the manga and anime are still ongoing, even after hundred of episodes and chapters, and yet One Piece still remains more exciting and thrilling than ever. Even after 400 episodes, the story is getting better and better. It is extremely hard and rare to find animes that have more than 100 episodes... and to never loose its pace is surly an accomplishment. Oda has done something rare - he has created a convincing alternate reality with thousands of interesting characters and places. Each are unique and bizarre in their own way. One Piece is a unique and epic masterpiece which tells the story of a young pirate, named Monkey D. Luffy who sets off to sea to gather a crew and to become the most famous pirate who ever lived, by becoming the Pirate King. The character interaction between Luffy and his crew mates is brilliant in One Piece and never becomes dull. After hundreds of episodes of this show, I gradually became attached to Luffy's crew. This is much drama, fighting, and comedic moments in this grand anime. Since this show was made in 1999, the art for the first couple of episodes can turn people away from this series. The art, of course, gets a lot better as the series progresses and was always interesting for me regardless. It is always inticing to observe the bizarre and intriguing world that Oda has created. The soundtracks are also classics, and even to this day I occasionally listen to them on my youtube playlist. Watching One Piece has become a sort of a ritual for me, as I have been watching a new episode every weekend for the past couple years.

"I don't understand why some people were put off by the arts at first. I just thought it was different when I saw it. I enjoyed the first few episodes and laughed a good couple of times and quickly labeled this show as &quot;For entertainment only&quot; since I thought it was some sort of Random-Funny clip shonen that takes a while to end. But as I continued to watch it and up to the Arlong arc, I was SHOCKED TO DEATH. I didn't know it could get so emotional and deep but it manages to be light hearted at the same time. I was so utterly charmed by Luffy and his crew's personality. They practically highlight each other perfectly, like the colors of a rainbow, they all stick together but each of them stand out, nobody is the same color. Others are for you to actually watch and find out what it's really about.

"Before I begin, let me just say that this all my opinion and completely subjective. If you enjoy the show then please ignore this as you will disagree with this for sure! One piece started good and I will be the first one to admit that. It does a good job of giving us a sense of the vastness and richness of its world and the interesting bunch of characters it houses within itself, and not gonna lie, that had me hyped AF. I had a fun time with the first few episodes and I truly used to think that this could be one of the most enjoyable long running anime for me. But as time went on, I started to see the faults in One Piece, and now I just look at it with a sense of disappointment because it has become such a bloated mess that has absolutely not kept up with the modern anime times. At this point, every arc feels like a modified repetition of the previous arcs. It starts off as an epic, long adventure anime which hooks you right from the beginning. The world feels fresh and invoke a sense of curiosity and adventure, and the character interactions felt wholesome and warm. The initial arcs feel enjoyable because of our curiosity to discover the lore of this world, and also because we get invested in the overarching plot of Luffy becoming the Pirate King and finding out what One Piece is. One of the things I really enjoyed and waited for at the end of every arc was to see what Luffy's new bounty would be. Now, here's where things go down the drain. The anime, inexplicably, decides to stretch the main premise to such an astronomical length that you just can't help but feel exhausted and burnt out. Each successive arc feels like the previous arc with added disguise and makeup. Luffy and his crew visit a new island where they discover that the people have been subjugated by an extremely strong Devil Fruit user who just so happens to be relatively somewhere around Luffy's strength. Luffy is set to fight the final boss, Zoro fights the second strongest person, and so on and so forth. You get the idea. People suffer life ending injuries and lose gorillian liters of blood only to somehow clutch the fight in the end. Luffy successfully pulls out a BS new move which defeats the final boss, leaving Luffy barely standing with 1 HP. Then, everyone has a celebration and a feast and the crew carry on with their journey to the next island to pull off the same exact arc once again. The whole thing kind of starts feeling cheap. If this sounds bad, wait till you hear how worse it gets after a certain time-skip. The story repeats upon itself so many times that you just cannot for the love of god feel any excitement at what you are watching. The novelty wore off quick at least in my case. Entire arcs were stretched so much that you cannot even sense any form of a meaningful progression in the plot. To give you an idea, consider this: Usually a decently paced anime adapts anywhere between 2-4 chapters per episode depending upon various factors. Usually, more chapters are adapted per episode if they have a lot of action scenes, and less chapters are adapted per episode if they are dialogue heavy. One Piece has taken 1015 episodes to adapt 1000 chapters. What that means is that the show has not even adapted 1 chapter per episode in its run up till the 1000th chapter which honestly is atrocious to say the least. Also, needless to say, the stakes - both physical and emotional - feel superficial and fake. Same old tropes and methods of trying to evoke an artificial reaction or emotions from the viewers. Also, no character development, in my humble opinion. Usopp, who we once rooted for, became a comedian. Sanji is still a simp with no growing up in sight for him, Zoro is either fighting or setting up his overused gag of being unable to find the way. The world felt huge and interesting in the beginning. Now it feels boring and less creative and just plain predictable. Also, the author kind of forgot to keep the 'One Piece' aspect of the show relevant by at least throwing in some small arcs or plot points and giving us a few substantial crumbs dedicated exclusively about it. But all we get is some insignificant, random teasing with no concrete development to shape what One Piece might be. Kind of frustrating, personally speaking. At this point, the journey has become so boring that I don't care anymore. I will just read up on what One Piece is when it finally gets revealed in the manga in the year 2099. My conclusion is that, the journey was definitely not worth it. I tried getting into manga as well which I was not a big fan of either. I guess that was because the anime left such a sour taste in my mouth. But oh well! There are so many better, shorter, more enjoyable shows out there. I would rather watch the one piece remake by WIT studio which I just know is going to exponentially superior than this slug fest. It might take ages but that's fine, I would rather spend my time watching other better shows in the meantime. 4/10",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 5, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fccd4db86d,4
"Where do I even begin with this monstrosity called ""One Piece""? I had heard so much hype about this anime, but after subjecting myself to a few episodes, I'm left wondering if the creators were on some kind of hallucinogenic substance while putting this disaster together. First of all, the art style is an eyesore. The characters look like they've been drawn by a five-year-old with a crayon in one hand and a chainsaw in the other. It's as if the animators decided to take every feature of the human body and exaggerate it to the point of grotesque deformity. Seriously, I've seen less exaggerated expressions on cartoons meant for toddlers. And let's talk about the pacing – or rather, the lack thereof. It's like the creators discovered the concept of filler episodes and decided to take it to a whole new level. The story moves at the pace of a sloth on sedatives, with pointless detours, irrelevant side characters, and enough flashbacks to make your head spin. I've seen snails move faster than the plot of this anime. The world-building is also laughable. A nonsensical mishmash of pirate clichés, fantastical creatures, and bizarre abilities that make no logical sense whatsoever. I get it, it's a fantasy world, but at least make it internally consistent. It's like the writers throw in whatever random idea they come up with, without any thought to how it fits into the larger narrative. Oh, and the characters? Don't even get me started. Luffy, the main character, is a brain-dead buffoon with all the depth of a puddle. He's so one-dimensional that I'm surprised he doesn't disappear when he turns sideways. The rest of the crew isn't any better – a bunch of forgettable tropes that you've seen a million times before in better anime. The dialogue... ugh. It's a cringe-fest of cheesy one-liners, predictable speeches about friendship and dreams, and enough shouting to make your eardrums bleed. I've seen more nuanced conversations on a playground full of screaming toddlers. In conclusion, ""One Piece"" is a colossal waste of time and brain cells. It's an assault on the senses, an insult to storytelling, and a blight on the anime world. If you value your sanity, stay as far away from this abomination as possible. Your brain cells will thank you.",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 28, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7161198f0a,4
"I believe the only redeeming trait of One piece is that it has good world building that serves as a driving force to keep the story interesting for so long. The animation is bad and so are some of the designs; though this does interplay with the mood that the story portrays, lighthearted and cheerful. I personally found this part of the story off putting because I feel that One piece can serve various age ranges. It is clear that the style is overly exaggerated when it comes to the lighthearted, bright and cheerful designs to reach a younger age range. This makes the setting sort of stale as every place the characters visit the mood doesn't change. This draws the attention that we used to have on the setting away because the adventurous islands became normal to the story. This isn't exactly bad though because it is part of the worlds style as an adventurous and wild world it helped establish a feel. Sound: This is more about dialouge. ANNOYING CHARACTERS at first. As stated in the previous section the story makes veiwers get used to parts of the story. I HATED the characters at first I had to get 500 episodes into the story to get used to the character troupes and traits to the point I enjoyed them. Don't like characters Only thing good about the characters are comedic aspects and if there are good characters like Doflomingo or Whitbeard they aren't well rounded. The characters usually have one good thing about them shown and are not developed any further. STALE CHARACTERS My favorite character is Bartolemeo for those who have watched One peice I hate Nami I like Sanji I sorta like Zoro I like Brook I hate Chopper I'm iffy about Segoking (wish Ussopin had joined again) Dislike Franky (only because he does not get enough screentime/action ) No feeling about the sushi Don't like anything about Luffy most of the time don't care bout ROOOBIIINN-SWAAAANNNN I love the Going Merry Hated pacing, fights, conflicts and pretty much every stupid moment happening for the sake of conflict that should've been easily ended or prevented.

"This review will cover the first “half” of one piece (Ep 1-516) just so you can tell what period this is based on but I won’t give any spoilers so calm down. Let me start by saying my first introduction to one piece was through the 4kids dub and I have to say I didn’t mind it. Of course a few years later when I watched the original subbed version it really shows the major flaws with the 4kids version luckily I didn’t get too far into it. I have seen some of the FUNimation episodes and for those of you who do prefer English dub that would be the way to go. Now for the review… Story: One piece’s story is one of the best constructed anime series around, you watch it back and you can pick up references to people or events over 400 episodes in the future… that’s a well thought out story line. You see Luffy grow from a young child to a capable captain of a crew, dreaming of being king of the pirates! It’s not only Luffy that has a goal, every crew member has their own dream and these are explored as well. Each member of the Straw Hat crew is a main character, while not being as focused as Luffy, you see everybody’s backstory making every person someone you become attached to. One of the best features of this series is that it can deliver on the paths it chooses either if it’s a more fantasy styled setting like Skypiea or a hectic battlefield at Marineford each setting works in the one piece universe and the emotional connection you end up getting towards each character makes the comedy/heartbreak/success/failure of each plot a gripping one. Art: Honestly, when I first started watching it I didn’t enjoy the art style compared to other animes and a lot of the people I showed it to at that time had similar opinions but once you watch it for a bit it grows on you and you wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The way Oda has drawn the characters really has given him the opportunity to throw some very “unique” looking characters into the mix in the future episodes without them seeming out of place. Sound: The music and sound effects are perfect, if you watch the first OVA of One Piece you can hear the dominant sound of rubber being stretched every time Luffy makes an attack, while good for effect they made it look like it took a lot of effort in order to stretch. The anime series changed this making the sound not as harsh and as a result it makes the action more free-flowing. The music itself sets the mood exactly like it should and the times where a song you know becomes dominant in the series when something is about to go down really increases the effect the scene has one you. The voice actors also do a terrific job of conveying the right tone and volume for each scene. Conclusion: In the end I base my scores on how much enjoyment I felt while watching each series and in this series 10/10! And I don’t like giving out 10s but from the amount of wondrous time one piece has given me… it’s worth it and you should definitely watch it. First review, any feedback would be good to help improve future reviews. Thanks for reading.",10,Recommended,"Dec 10, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_86ebbeaf4e,4
"The Story - It starts out feeling Cliche with &quot;im gonna be king of the pirates&quot; by finding one piece! but really the story more revolves around Luffy wanting to go on adventures and if there's one thing that One Piece delivers on its the feeling of a huge world and a very very Epic adventure that you are almost not gonna get in any other anime. The Art - alot of people do not like the art style of one piece. but i myself find it very unique, so you actually feel like you're watching something very different in a very good way. The Sound - One Piece, in my opinion, has some of the very best japanese voice actors and the music in it is just phenomenal when something big happens you know its something big because the music that goes along with the show complements it all so well. Characters - unlike what seems to be the current standard of emo main characters and clingy annoying girls, this show breaks away from all of that using a very enthusiastic main character, and instead of a girl a clingy guy that is handled in a comedic manner instead of annoying. This show also has possibly the best character development of characters in any anime i have ever seen. when you watch the show you real get to feel like you know the character instead of just watching them. Enjoyment - You may look at the length of the show (which when this is written was almost 400) and say &quot;I'd prolly get bored watching such a long anime&quot; but this is not the case as the show just gets better the further you get. Overall - this anime is a must see for anyone who likes anime. and do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch the 4kids Dub, watch the sub, or else its a whole different experience.",10,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b51c0b0f09,4
"""A man's dream will never die"" When I started my venture into anime, there were three shows that I told myself that I was not going to watch: Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. This is because these three show have one thing in common: They're still on the air. Watching a lot of anime is as bad as it sounds, but watching something and trying to catch up with is even worse. Plus, I mocked these three series for their appeal to the younger crowd. Then, suddenly I was told that One Piece, the childish-looking one out of them all, is actually the best out of all of them. To be honest, I always thought One Piece was the butchered piece of crap that was presented to me by 4Kids when I was younger. Then I found out that Funimation picked it up and re-dubbed it when 4Kids went out of business. I watched the first episode of Funimation dub...I have now seen all 10 movies, 430 episodes, and watched most of the OVAs. In other words, One Piece is one of the greatest and most addicting animes of all time. How could a show that I once regarded as juvenile be masterful? Well, first off it's not juvenile, in fact it's quite brutal. At first, it's starts off normal. We are introduced to our protagonist, the carefree and determined Monkey D. Luffy, the self-proclaimed future king of the pirates. He seeks to achieve this goal by forming the best pirate crew, sail the whole world, and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece. This is our first step into the brilliance of this show. Luffy, while not the brightest person and well-mannered person, is the character we as the audience want to look up to. While some can debate that his decisions always tend to cause destruction and violence, it's that utter lack of not having fear that chills go down my spine. It's the idea that we must go on our own adventures in life and pursue our dreams even if others say that they're dead and unreachable. However, we've all seen this story before right? There have been numerous stories about going the distance and following our dreams. What makes One Piece so different then? If I were to summarized One Piece in one line then it would be this: One Piece cuts the bull shit. Most stories about going the distance always have that one point where the characters give up or something happens that prevents and then something happens that suddenly makes them want to move forward. One Piece...there is no such thing. One Piece is all about becoming stronger. Stronger to stand up for the people you care for, stronger to advance on your journey, stronger to be ready for that final goal. This is One Piece's true accomplishment. The show also has a strong sense of humor. There are so many times where I have chuckled and even laughed out loud from the comedy of this show. Even if it's running gags such as Zoro's lack of direction or Sanji's weakness for beautiful women, there is always something fresh and some sort of new take on it. This leads me to my next point. One Piece not only emits happiness and laughter, but all other emotions as well. Emotions such as sadness, fear, hope, love, and sometimes even anger. We as the audience feel this because our main characters feel it as well. I can say that you will probably find something about yourself in the form of these characters. For example, like Luffy, I have always have had tried to fight for that one dream. Like Sanji, while his actions are exaggerated a bit, even I have to admit that I have always catered to woman's needs more than men. Like Usopp, I have always have felt like the weakest of group, the one who is inferior compared to my stronger peers. Like Robin, I have always felt like the one who was misunderstood, the one who has been labeled by society as this type of person. One Piece shows that sometimes it's okay to be different because even when the whole world is against you, there are people who will stand by your side and will fight to protect you. These character only then are brought to life by the people who play them. I have seen the first 205 episodes in English and it shows off what Funimation does best and makes up for what 4Kids did. After that, I switched from the English, as new dubbed episodes are coming out later this year, to the Japanese track where the voice acting is also top notch. It was interesting to know that some seiyuus here are actually well known. For example, Chopper's seiyuu is Pikachu, Zoro's seiyuu is Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and the one that I think that a lot of you are going shocked by is that Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamguchi, the voice of L and older Detective Conan. Right now I have been introduced to the character Boa Hancock and her seiyuu is Kotono Mitsuishi, the original voice Sailor Moon, the voice of Misato from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Excel Excel from what else than Excel Saga. The voice actors do amazing jobs in both languages giving some truly powerful performances. It should also be addressed that the score to One Piece is unforgettable. The music of One Piece not only matches great anime scores such as Cowboy Bebop's or the original FMA anime, but even stacks up to John Williams and Danny Elfman film scores. Trust me when I say that after watching the show for a long time, background music will become so familiar to which you will start humming plus also indicating the type of situation that lies ahead. The animation of One Piece is also something of noteworthy. Unlike, traditional animes, the animation of One Piece is more of like of that of a combination of old animes, American cartoons, and in the hi-res episodes like that of conventional animes from today. In a way, it's a something of it's own style, probably the one thing that will make anime fans, who are used to animes looking like shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, not want to watch to this show. However, the cartoonish visuals of One Piece only makes it unique from everything else. While we do see some carbon copies of characters here and there, not often does a character look like another character and have the same personality. I tell you one thing, I have to admit while characters like Nami or Robin or any of the women in this show do have ridiculous anime proportions, it only makes me wonder are there woman in the world that possibly exist (oh it's times like this that hate that I'm a geek). However, this also allows me to say what you should know when watching it. Do not question anything that happens. I know that's a weird thing to say considering that ""no duh it's a cartoon it shouldn't be taken seriously."" However, I say this because the thing is the show keeps you so invested that you forget that a lot of wacky cartoonish things occur and some animes of this nature like to take themselves seriously when they shouldn't. Luckily, the show is aware of itself and often makes meta jokes about the characters and the situations that occur. I have seen a lot animes and the ones that I consider my personal favorites I wish have lasted longer than just 26 or 51 episodes. One Piece, on the other hand is still running to this day and to be honest when that day comes, it's going to be sad seeing the final adventure of the Strawhats. I love One Piece, it moves away from the standard conventional ideas and gives them the middle finger. Damsel in Distress, screw that, we already have two ladies that that can kick ass. Living by government rules to which One Piece answers, ""there is no honor in the government, it's full a people stubborn people who only do it for the sake of following orders."" What about villains? Clearly all of them have the same personality right? ""who is the real villain here, is it the government hunting the pirates, is it the other pirates, or it could it possibly be Luffy and the rest of the Strawhat Crew who are the real villains here?"" One Piece on the surface may look like the average shounen but deep down there is something more than just skinny yet large chested women and cool action fights. I'll just say this right now: One Piece is the first anime that made me cry. More than Wolf's Rain, Clannad, and Grave of the Fireflies. One Piece will be and should be remembered among anime fans as something as a tale of hopes and dreams. If you have not seen One Piece, then there is no better time than to start watching now. How can I put this: If you wanted to choose out of the big three (four if you include now Fairy Tail) shounens, then One Piece is your answer. I love it and I swear you are going to love it as well.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_32495ff687,4

Good: Characters - One piece has some of the best written characters I have seen in anime Humour - maybe not at the first few arcs, but one piece has made me genuinely laugh a few times, which is more than I can say for most anime Plot - It might feel repetitive when you go through arcs and there are new people to save and whatnot, but it gets super intricate and I love how everything is connected Bad: Pacing - the pacing is so terrible in the anime it is borderline unwatchable.

"I absolutely must write a review for One Piece because it's my favorite anime to date. Shonen-action wise, I think that One Piece easily beats competitors such as Naruto and Bleach. (Apparently, in Japan, it has sales that outrank Naruto and Bleach combined? That's quite the opposite of its status in America lol) Anyways, One Piece is an epic anime series. It has the awesome fighting that a shonen fan needs, it has an EPIC storyline, great character designs, (I love basically every character that Oda introduces other than the villians he makes that readers are suppose to hate so that when he gets his ass kick it'll be so much more satisfying, of course) an awesome awesome soundtrack, lots of intense drama, and just overall greatness. I even enjoyed *most* of the fillers; I felt that they were somewhat on par with the canon. It's a definite must watch for...everyone...WATCH IT!",10,Recommended,"May 16, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5d295d15ca,5
"There are stories, and then there is One Piece. To call it a masterpiece feels like an understatement—it’s a phenomenon that stands as a towering testament to the limitless power of storytelling. Eiichiro Oda hasn’t just written a manga or inspired an anime; he’s built a living, breathing universe that beats with the heart of its fans. This is more than fiction. It’s a legacy. At the center of it all is Monkey D. Luffy—a boy with a straw hat and a dream so audacious it shakes the very foundations of his world. Luffy isn’t just a character; he’s a movement, a spirit that reminds us to laugh, to cry, and to fight for what we believe in. His pursuit of the Pirate King’s crown isn’t about treasure—it’s about freedom, friendship, and carving your place in a world that constantly tells you “no.” But Luffy isn’t alone. The Straw Hat crew isn’t just a group of allies—they are a family forged in blood, tears, and unshakable resolve. Zoro, the steadfast swordsman with a will as sharp as his blade. Nami, whose navigation skills steer them toward hope even when her heart has weathered storms of betrayal. Sanji, balancing his culinary artistry with a penchant for chivalry. Robin, Franky, Usopp, Brook, Jinbei, and Chopper—all of them are dreamers who have dared to defy a world that tried to break them. Yet it’s not just the characters that make One Piece extraordinary—it’s the world they inhabit. Oda has built a universe so detailed, so intricate, it feels like it’s been waiting for us to discover it. The Grand Line is alive: from the bustling ports of Water 7 to the haunting majesty of Thriller Bark, from the skybound wonder of Skypiea to the war-torn beauty of Dressrosa. Every island tells a story, and every story leaves you in awe of Oda’s genius. And the themes—oh, the themes! Dreams. Freedom. Sacrifice. Justice. The weight of history and the unrelenting march of time. Oda threads these ideas together with surgical precision, creating a narrative tapestry that is at once epic and deeply personal. He doesn’t just want you to watch; he wants you to feel. The laughter of a crewmate. The sting of a betrayal. The crushing weight of Ace’s final words: “Thank you for loving me.” The writing is a masterclass in foreshadowing. Events you barely notice in one arc explode into life hundreds of chapters later. The emotional payoffs are staggering—every tear you shed, every laugh you share with the Straw Hats is earned. And let’s not forget the animation. Over the years, Toei Animation has turned One Piece into a visual marvel. From the iconic Gear Fifth reveal to the raw emotional devastation of Marineford, the series transforms panels into moments that make your heart race and your soul soar. One Piece isn’t just peak anime or peak manga. It’s the peak of human creativity. It reminds us that dreams are worth chasing, no matter how impossible they seem. It shows us that freedom isn’t something you’re given—it’s something you take. For over 1,000 episodes and counting, One Piece has stood as a lighthouse in the vast ocean of storytelling. And as we sail closer to the shores of its conclusion, one thing is clear: no matter what the One Piece turns out to be, we’ve already found the treasure. 10/10. Peakkkkkkkkk.",10,Recommended,"Jan 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ec578c2f45,5
"So I wanted to do an updated review of the mainline series because I have some new thoughts about it but I couldn’t do that unless I deleted my OG review which I didn’t wanna do. So I decided to post my updated review first from 4/17/2025 where I was on episode 1125 and then at the bottom is my OG review from 04/02/2024 where I was on episode 1099 just letting you all know. And don’t worry I’ll separate both parts so as not to confuse y'all. ---04/17/2025 (1125/? episodes) So ever since One Piece returned from its hiatus about a week ago, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. And the more I do think about it, the more I realize how much of a fan I am of it. It’s really the one shounen that I can think of where it was hard for me to get into at first, but once I hunkered down and decided to lock in, it would only grow on me and win me over, which is a phenomenon that fans like me call: “The One Piece Effect.” You know that one episode from SpongeBob where Squidward was hating on the Krabby Patty and didn’t wanna try it, but then he takes this teeny tiny bite out of it, then says it wasn’t good, but next thing you know he’s eating so many Krabby Patties that it’s making him fat af? Well that analogy has been pretty much my experience with One Piece. Now I wasn’t hating on it like Squidward but I only thought it was ok and I didn’t have the strongest feelings for it at first. And I’ve said this before, but I was even thinking of dropping the series entirely. But now that I’ve caught up with the anime and have been watching it weekly for about a year now, I can look back at that time and laugh at it, because I'm now grateful that I've stuck with this series through thick and thin. This is easily the longest I’ve ever been with any TV show that I’ve watched, and watching this show weekly has pretty much become a part of my daily life. Now the consensus that I’ve heard from manga readers is that the pacing is worse in the anime compared to how it is in the manga. Which is why there are websites like One Pace, which is a fan made project that cuts out filler scenes from the anime to try to make it more in line with Oda’s original work. And you may not believe me when I say this, but I had no idea websites like this existed until I had already caught up with the OG anime. Yeah I was watching the normal ass episodes that apparently had worse pacing for the longest time and once I found out about this, I thought: “Wow, that could’ve saved me sooo much time. Too bad I’m already caught up!” And I do have one big complaint with this series but it’s really a personal issue and nothing against the series itself, but there is so much shit to keep track of and remember with this series that it is just overwhelming for me. Now don’t get me wrong, this is great cause it gives the audience a lot and I mean a lot to chew on and digest. The word building and attention to detail that this series has is really second to none. But as someone who doesn’t have the best memory and as long as this show is, it’s a guarantee that I’ll forget some character names and lore. However, the special thing about this series is that just when you have forgotten a plot point or character that may have happened/appeared 100 episodes or more earlier, or in real time, these things may have occured fucking YEARS ago, the series will remind you of that moment or piece of lore at the appropriate time which is very cool and that does help with my memory a bit. And it kinda blows my mind that a slow burning series like this is as popular and mainstream as it is. And like it or not One Piece is one of the most influential and culturally significant anime/manga of our time. Recently they’ve collabed with sports teams like the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Lakers, the ladder of which featuring my glorious King LeBron James. There was the live-action One Piece adaptation on Netflix which was quite successful and that I found to be a pleasant surprise. There’s The One Piece which is the anime remake by Wit Studio that’s said to be more in line with the manga but idk when that’s coming out. I’ve even heard that there’s a freaking stage play at Universal Studios Japan and even a future attraction coming soon since the show is THE anime in Japan, it’s practically worshipped there. And of course, there’s One Piece skins in Fortnite, which I don’t even like Fortnite but once a fictional or even a nonfictional character gets a skin in Fortnite, that’s when you know they’ve made it into the modern mainstream audience. So to say that fans have been eating in recent years is really an understatement. And as for me, even though I’ve been eating the main course I wanted to taste a little of the side dishes if you know what I mean. So I’ve been watching a few of the OP movies, at least the ones that most people consider to be good. Even tho they’re not canon I think they’re fun little distractions. I’ve also been playing a few of the games, and when I say a few of the games, I mean only like one game, and that's Pirate Warriors 4. Because I've heard most fans say that it's one of the better OP game while the rest aren't as enjoyable which is understandable since most anime games for the longest time have been known for being either mid or ass say for a few exceptions. So overall, while I still think Hunter x Hunter is my personal favorite shounen of all time, One Piece has been doing a great job filling the void that the HxH anime left behind for me, because at this point I’ve accepted that the HxH anime is not going to return anytime soon but at least the manga is still being published, very slowly that is. So with that info, I’d say One Piece is now a close second as far as shounen goes. While I don't think it's perfect (I mean no anime is perfect), I’ve realized that I've given anime 10s with more flaws than this one, plus the positives in this series still outweigh the negatives and I’ve never seen a TV show with THIS many episodes being more consistent than One Piece. Keep up the good work Oda! 😊👍 ---04/02/2025 (1099/? episodes) If you ask me, One Piece is one (no pun intended) of the most fun anime I have ever seen. Those are the best words I can use to describe it: it’s just…so fun. But unfortunately, I don’t think I would recommend it to first-time anime viewers. Mostly because it’s obviously a pretty daunting show clocking in with over 1000 episodes, in fact the longest story arc as of now (that being Wano Kuni) is approximately 208 episodes! Like, damn. But despite its intimidating reputation, I think once you have a little more experience with anime and if you are a more patient viewer who’s willing to give it a try, I think you’ll find something very approachable and rewarding. But on the other hand, I also think that this is the one shounen that’s just not gonna be for everyone. Because I remember back when I first took the plunge with this series, I thought to myself: “Man, this show is slow and boring!” Yeah, I just wasn’t feeling it at first, it wasn’t my jam. I wouldn’t say it was bad or anything, I just thought it was ok at best. But I was kind of turned off by a lot of things in this show, from the artstyle and humor which is all very cartoony and childish to the kind of annoying characters, I’m looking at you Luffy. And I wasn’t really watching it as much as other shows, movies, etc at the time and I was thinking of dropping it multiple times. But I was still willing to give the show a chance because it’s so popular and beloved and I wanted to know why that is. And I think it was at the point where once I started the Alabasta arc (episode 62), I began to realize: “Wait a minute, this show is actually kinda good.” And the more I watched it from that point, the more this show began to grow on me and win me over. To the point where after Robin had her iconic moment during Enies Lobby, I was like: “Goddamit, I love this show now.” And I have been riding with it without turning back ever since. It was like my third eye was opening just a little bit more with each arc and I was gradually beginning to see Oda's vision for how insane but also creative this series can be. And the aspects that I didn’t fuck with at first started to grow on me in a big way, like the art style and humor. Which yes, the humor is your typical over-the-top anime humor which isn’t really my thing, but I began to realize that this type of humor fits like a glove with this art style that’s so colorful and distinct and also weirdly nostalgic, because it kind of reminds me of cartoons that I used to watch as a kid. Another thing that began to grow on me were the characters, specifically the titular Straw Hat captain himself: Monkey D. Luffy. Who at first I thought was the most annoying character in the whole show, and while I do think he kind of stays the same headstrong and food-obsessed boy that we have seen at the beginning of the show, he does actually become more of a badass throughout the narrative. There is this one moment that really stood out to me during Fishman Island where Jimbei tells him that he needs to be more responsible as a captain instead of just dicking around all the time and getting his crew in danger since at that point in the show, that's what he's been doing as a captain. But then Luffy reveals that he is aware of that responsibility but he'd just rather take his chances and see what happens since for him it's more fun that way. Uh, alright, I'll accept that answer I guess. I wouldn’t exactly say it’s character development as much as it is character progression. And this goes for every Straw Hat crew member. Now I have heard the complaint that this show has no tension because all the Straw Hats survive every predicament they are in. And yeah, you’re right, but there’s still plenty of tension in this show. It just chooses to use the environment for tension instead of what will happen to our main protagonists. Like in Alabasta or Wano where the Straw Hats have to save a country from a cold-blooded ruler, or anything that happens in Marineford. If you don’t think this show has tension or stakes, well then I don’t know what to tell you. As far as my favorite characters in this series, the one character that I easily liked from first impressions alone is Chopper. Who is just so goddamn cute and adorable that I’m tempted to buy a stuffed animal of him off of Amazon. He kind of reminds me of Shippo from InuYasha but if he was less annoying, more interesting and contributed more to the Straw Hats success, since he is the doctor of the crew. So yeah, he might be my spirit animal and I also strangely really like Robin. Not because she’s hot…ok maybe because she’s kind of hot but y’know she’s a cool character, she’s got enjoyable qualities if you know what I mean lol. But seriously, I feel like she has one of the more interesting backstories out of the Straw Hats, and I also love how she acts kind of motherly towards Chopper, like it always warms my heart when those two are together. Oh, and she’s an archeologist, which reminds me of Indiana Jones, which is a major plus for me because I get really nostalgic and giddy when something reminds me of Indiana Jones. One thing I respect about One Piece is how despite this show looking very cartoonish and colorful, it’s never afraid to get depressing and even kinda violent. I also love the theme of found family which I think is pretty universal and is most likely one of the traits that has led to this series' widespread appeal. Another thing I respect is the animation, or at least how it evolves. I even once thought: “You know maybe the animation will stagnate because there’s so many episodes.” But that is absolutely not the case here. In fact, the animation actually improves with each passing arc. To the point where once I got to Wano Kuni, I started thinking: “Where did this animation come from?” Yeah I’ll just say that Wano is easily without question the best animated story arc that we’ve gotten so far and I’ll just leave it there. I did mention that Wano is the longest arc in this show and I’ve said this before but I'll say it again, I’m not the biggest fan of long arcs. I’ve said why in some other reviews but when it comes to this show, long story arcs are its specialty and kind of something you have to accept. This series is very much trying to be a slow burn compared to other shounen and I respect that. From the continuity to the subtle foreshadowing to of course the world building that’s always on point. Oda really has the nerve to make each arc better than the last one. How he even comes up with some of this shit is beyond me because like I said before, this show is just insane. Even during the beginning of some arcs, I would be thinking: “Yeah, this isn’t really that interesting to me, maybe this arc will be one of the weaker ones.” The story will get flipped on its head out of nowhere to make me engaged again. A prime example of what I’m talking about is during the end of Sabaody, if you know you know. Now as I am typing this review, I consider myself a very casual One Piece enjoyer. Like I only watch the mainline series, I don’t watch any of the movies, or read the manga. And for some reason, manga readers seem to hate the anime and I wasn’t really sure why so I decided to look into it and it mostly just has to do with the business model of the anime. People just complain that the pacing is worse compared to the manga. I don’t know, I feel like this personally doesn’t concern me because I’ve never read the manga. I’m sure the manga is great but I don’t really read much manga. That’s why a lot of manga is adapted to anime because most people just don’t like to read, me included. I mean you always hear the “manga is better” excuse whenever a new anime comes out. To the point where I just have to ask: Why even watch anime at all when people are just gonna say that the manga is better? Anyway, I would talk more about this show, but then I would be getting into spoilers. But even though this show has grown on me a lot since I first started watching it, I still do have a few critiques. For one, I think the animation from East Blue to Skypiea has really not aged well which is probably why they're going back and redoing them. Plus this show does have its fair share of filler episodes but compared to other shounen that’s over a 100 episodes, there’s surprisingly very little of them despite this show being super long so it’s not the biggest deal breaker in the world. Also some of the fan service can be a little distracting at times even if my intrusive thoughts say otherwise. Another thing is that as much as I like Zoro and Sanji as characters, their pissing contest has started to become a little played out, especially since I have seen more than 1000 episodes of this show and those two still have beef with one another. I assume they are going to squash their differences in the end but who knows. Oh another thing that’s become played out is Sanji being a simp for women. Now I get that’s like his main joke and flaw as a character but when I think of down bad anime characters, Sanji is usually in the top five, and that’s not a good thing. Although I will say at some points I can definitely sympathize with why he violently nosebleeds over the sight of some of these women because…y’know…who wouldn’t do backflips for some of the women in this show? Yeah, this show can get kind of horny at a lot of points. I feel like Oda purposely drew some of their knockers almost bigger than their head just to fuck with us straight men. Am I being weird? I’ll move on. And the last nitpick that I have is that the story arcs are kind of the same to me. Not that they feel the same, but they are more so structured the same. They usually follow this pattern: The Straw Hats arrive on an island, shenanigans ensue on the island, and the arc usually ends with Luffy fighting the main bad guy. There are obviously exceptions to this, but that’s kind of how most of the story arcs play out and I kinda wish there could be a little more variety although this series does do a good job at masking the similarities of other arcs to help you not notice. But despite this, there really isn't a bad arc in this series to me. Yeah I guess arcs like Fishman Island are a little weak and pale in comparison to the best arcs but I wouldn't say they're terrible like other people have said. So even if this series does have some flaws and it isn’t exactly my favorite shounen ever, I cannot deny that it still absolutely rocks and I think the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. I’ll probably continue to watch it for years to come and I’m glad that I have stuck with this show for as long as I have because if I dropped it, I feel like I might have regretted it. I have no idea when this show is gonna end but god dammit I’ll say that it can go on for as long as it wants, just if it continues to keep a consistent level of quality and I hope to be there when it does end. I know the Big Three (One Piece, Naruto and Bleach) isn’t really a thing anymore, but I definitely see why most people call this the best one out of the three because it kind of is. It’s the most creative, the most colorful, and the most planned out. Again, I don’t think it’s a masterpiece for me but I can still see why people call it “peak fiction."" So for now, I'll probably give it a 9/10.",10,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6c2f271835,5

"I think I can overlook the cons of this show because it's pros outweigh it by a lot. First off, I commend Toei for being able to consistently drop episodes weekly for the last 25 years, with animation that never ceases to disappoint. That's one of the pros. Another is it's excellent world building. I think it's got the best world building for any show ever. There are over 1000 characters and each of them have enough depth (for their roles). Everyone is accounted for and no one gets left behind or forgotten in the story. Another one of it's pros is the insane story telling and the depth the story goes into, particularly the foreshadowing. Nearly everything has a meaning in One Piece, and it will always lead to something big later on in the story. That takes me to my next point, the mysteries surrounding the show. It keeps the viewer always wanting to know what happens next. The story baffles and mindfuckes the viewer when the viewer realises the connections between mysteries and previous events to the later parts in the story. Another great aspect of the show is how well developed the characters are. They each have deep backstories that really connect the watchers to the characters on a personal level. One Piece does a really good job at advancing a characters progress in arcs where it makes sense. They don't force progression just because other characters are progressing. Be advised, this is peak. Be prepared to cry and to be amazed with this show.",10,Recommended,"Sep 1, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_244ea4a515,5
"I started watching this anime when was showing in Cartoon Network back there and then I found out about the 4kids nonsense so I switched to Japanese anime, this is the first anime I watched in its original language and I was enjoying it, until I guess the Skypea season, I think this is where it went down hill or maybe it was since the beginning and I just figured it out, anyway... I started to get frustrated by the pacing of the chapters, the same thing made me not like Dragon Ball, the feeler in the chapters that ruins the pacing I hate it, I that Toei stretch the emotion scenes so much. It makes it unbearable. But what made me drop the anime was the fandom, I know you can be passionate about it (I'm a unapologetically fanboy of Naruto and I like Boruto FIGHT ME!!!!) But I understand the critics this anime has and I still enjoy Kishimoto's work, but with One Piece, I just can't comprehend how unhinged they get when I complain about the pacing of the anime. They get mad. Funny thing, those are the same reasons I don't like Dragon Ball either, interesting, another Toei anime... I don't hate Toei, they made Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon, Yu☆Gi☆Oh!, Digimon, etc. which makes me very frustrated Read the manga, let's see the reboot by Wit studio how will go, hope they fix this",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 18, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0622f3f0ce,5

"*Spoiler Free Review* One Piece is an Anime about Pirates, Mainly one crew of Pirates called ""Straw Hats"". It is a action adventure anime, where the characters have special powers and are super strong. The Main storyline isn't that amazing, It's typical boy has a dream, boy goes out to obtain said dream, but what is amazing is the side storys that mixes into the main story, and there are tons, most of these are character background or goals, but it all fits in very nice, due to how big the One Piece world is, and how well the characters are devolped. The main reason I gave Story a 7 is due to the real main story, it's been done tons of times. The artwork and animation in this Anime gets alot of negitave response, but on the whole i'd say its average, its not rubbish by any standard, and sometimes has some very nice effects, But it's not the best out there. Don't be put off by the people who list the animation as why one piece sucks, because its the most stupidest thing ever, people still play old video games and watch old anime, do people complain about the graphics/ animation in them? No. The Sound is this Anime is epic, The Voice actors are very good at their jobs eppeically Zoro and Luffy. The Music is full of epic win! Most of all, all of the sound effects sound like the real thing, which is always a good thing, you know somethings up when a sword sounds like a wet fish hiting a rock. The Characters are very well devolped, even the majority of the lesser know characters have somewhat of a devolped background and continue to devolpe in the anime, something most animes don't have. I like that One piece does this, as it adds to the well written universe the creators have made, and it also allows the One Piece world to expand. To finish things off, the amount of enjoyment i get out of this anime has only ever been rivaled by Death Note, comparing it to other animes of the same genre however, nothing has came close to topping how well everything in One piece goes, and sometimes I hope that the show will never end, because I find it that much of an enjoyment to watch. So go check it out, if it sounds intresting to you, if not, well i guess my review skills suck, and you should go read a diffrent one piece review :P",9,Recommended,"May 14, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_331c821c93,5
"SPOILERLESS REVIEW: I don't know what to type in this review to not get One piece fans upset but I'll say this, One piece isn't bad but in my perspective it isn't good either, it's in the middle or what you call mid, I can understand why people call this ""good"" or even ""great"" but it seems to me that people have become too carried away and started saying things like no piece of fiction comes close to One piece and Oda's writing is perfect and all mangaka or authors are inferior to him which is false and shows people's ignorance and sheep like mindsets that caused One piece to become a toxic ""cult"" like fandom, this doesn't include 100% of the fandom but still a scary majority of them. Now I'll go over the review which I'd go over various categories and what I think: Characters: The characters in one piece are very simple with surface level depth, we can see that Oda didn't think too hard while drawing and writing them, when Oda writes a new character into one piece I can imagine It going like this: first he thinks of a design that looks wacky and ugly or deformed or funny or cool or sexy or anything that isn't a normal human being with normal anatomy, the designs are easy to draw despite their attempt to stand out and look unique, some of the characters are circle with limbs or with a head 3x the size of their body or with any other features that stand out , the designs stand out but aren't ""creative"" or something that requires thinking, just pick up the pen and everything goes basically, secondly after getting a design he gives them a personality that most of the time resembles their designs making them act as goofy as they look, they mostly have a ""gag"" that even if heaven and earth flipped they wouldn't mature and stop using that ""gag"", what I mean by ""gag"" is a certain personality, act, laugh, way to talk, traits that are common with all shounens anime like killer bee's rapping from naruto, sanji's degeneracy, luffy's stupidness and obsession with eating meat, etc. those ""gags"" aren't always a bad thing, but with Oda's overuse of them he creates himself a cast of characters that are bland and static, they don't develop anywhere, they can be ""funny"" but never interesting, and the lack of character development shows a big flaw in Oda's writing, static characters are easy to digest but fail to leave an impression, you can know what they are going to say or do 99% of the time, the lack of dynamic characters in one piece and the overuse of painfully static ones is easily visible, dynamic characters are the characters that change as they grow and do things that change the course and direction the plot is going, they are deep, unexpected, and as long as they are on screen you don't know what they are going to be or do 1 episode later, dynamic characters are needed and are hard for an author to write because of the thin line between character development and character assassination. It's easy to write a character knowing what it will do for the rest of the story. a show that focuses on being easy to digest will be childish with the depth of a kids show no matter what gory themes like slavery, racism may appear in the show, Oda gives some of his characters a finale touch with a backstory, in my opinion one piece backstories are mostly repetitive tear jerkers despite some good ones, the backstories mostly have one thing in common, either some of the character's loved ones died in an accidents or some dictator or government killed them, even the ones that don't fall under this category are forgettable and fail to touch me or connect me with the character emotionally, backstories also doesn't equal character development, those are different aspects of writing and can't cover on one another's flaws. Plot: the plot of one piece has a loop of a crying girl, dictator, fight , repeat with some standouts here and there, one of the most dominating theme in one piece is corruption, the theme revolves around evil dictators, governments, pirates commiting injustice with the power and influence they have to reach a selfish goal or desire. Here is how the loop goes: the straw hats pirates are a group of pirates devoting their trust and faith in a captain named Monkey D Luffy, they go to their goal which is the finale island to find the one piece and help Luffy achieve his dream (by the previous category you know my opinion about the characters and how they are written), they stop midway in islands to get clues on the poneglyphs which reveal where the one piece is, on those island there is always some signs of a problem or corruption going on, the straw hat pirates split up and meet a girl who will cry to luffy to stop the dictator, then she will go on about why Luffy doesn't have any reason to help and then a dramatic music will play and he will say ""I'll help you!"" then they run for 50 episodes to reach the finale boss spawn area with 100 of flashbacks and then they are in a state where Zoro fight the boss's right hand, sanji fights the left hand and the fodders go for all the other crew members, then Luffy reaches to the boss and says: ""there you are, I'll beat you!"" and the boss says: ""you have no chance"", and the fight starts with Luffy getting clapped till he says: ""I saved this power for last"" and then proceeds pull an asspull out of nowhere then the boss says ""impossible"" and Luffy lands the finale attack and everyone is happy. Repeat. World: the world of one piece consists of 2 lines with monothematic islands each island referencing a real place or a fairy tale theme. The world is very fun and unique and a plus to the show, there are various places across those 2 lines like a sky island, underwater island, elephant island , a palace of gods (mary jose) and a world government filled with history on the 100 year void. The world has a ton of history and mysteries and is infinitely expanding, that is probably the best part of one piece and what kept me watching despite bland characters and poor plot decisions. The world has depth the characters sadly do not. In summary: one piece isn't bad but is held back by poor writing and characters and has a great world. I don't think I'm some harvard graduate that knows better than everybody else and I don't even know if this review is good or not, I'm just expressing my opinion on a show I watched that wasn't for me + I wanted to go over more categories but I think that is enough to express my opinion about one piece. Hope you enjoyed.",5,Not Recommended,"Dec 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5d627c76c1,5
"I used to like One Piece a lot until the Whole Cake Island Arc, but from that point on, the anime seemed too childish. I think my opinion changed after watching other anime where the main character has a decent level of intelligence and delivers a final blow to defeat the enemy instead of chit-chatting. In One Piece, they often waste time talking, allowing enemies to return and cause more trouble later. That said, if you are new to anime, you will most likely love it, just like I did. However, if you’ve watched many other series where the protagonist acts decisively and doesn’t hesitate to finish off an enemy, you might find One Piece frustrating. I’ll probably watch a story recap after one or two years when the series is complete.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c736dcae47,5
"It's just sooo sad to see how shows like Bleach and Naruto are more popular than One Piece...it just goes to show how understimated this show rlly is... This is one of the few anime that have evrtyhing you would want in any series, from awsome action sequence, to hilarious comedy and then to drama. This is the only series, besides elfen lied, that has made real tears come from me. People shouldn't put a barrier between this show because the art style, which is what most ppl have problems with in this series, just because the style is unique and trying something new is not bad at all. Also, it shouldnt be judged by the bad job done on the dubbing of the series which totally killed it. There is a character for evryone here and anyone that truly calls themselves an anime fan should definitely give this show a try. It's no mistake the manga is #1 in Japan and since the naime is exactly like the manga...well u kno. Anyway, just don't judge a book by its cover and give it a shot!!!",10,Recommended,"Jan 6, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_813aba0fcd,5
"I just don't get why this anime is one of the most popular and loved ones of all time. I'll give my objective opinion. The thing that I like most about One Piece is just the atmosphere: the adventure of pirates sailing over the sea with a bunch of companions from different backgrounds. It's so dreamlike. It's anyone's dream. For the first few episodes (probably around 300 episodes or so), the anime successfully depicted and highlighted this kind of atmosphere: Luffy would travel from island to island, fighting against enemies, and recruiting a new colleague along the way. Eventually, the team grows in number and they adventure together. Each member has a unique ability and character which also make it more interesting. All in all, from the atmosphere perspective, it's heaven. But I think things just get worse and worse as the show continues. The scenes were predictable and repetitive. The fights become so dull and boring. Many awkward moments. Basically, you can summarize One Piece with this: entering a new island; finding out that the island was occupied by some villains; fighting against the villains; almost getting lost, but eventually winning; the island is successfully retaken. That's it. You'll just get this kind of pattern on every arc. And I would tell you something: the core members of the team would never, ever die no matter how strong the enemy is. The fights were extremely boring. Don't expect any logical and hype moments like in AOT and Naruto. You'll just get to watch both sides punching and throwing random powers and let the author decides who wins. Of course, eventually, the Luffy team would win. They may suffer in the beginning but eventually, some magic happens to rationalize their winning. Really, you can't analyze their power. Is the amount of power makes the opponent knocked down? No. Is it the quantity of the attack? No. The author decides which attack event determines the defeat of the opponent. How about the marine squads? Well they're just punching bags. From episode 500s and so, amateur and cringe stories are spread all over the place. The most cringe one: Kozuki Oden's arc. This is probably the worst arc ever. Spoiler alert! A man who basically was capable of defeating the occupier of his island, but perhaps he was a moron and an extremely idiot guy that never learn from experience. He got defeated and humiliated times and times again simply because he accepted the peace offering from the villain. Eventually, he got arrested. He then self-incinerating himself in the promise that if he's capable of staying alive after a certain period, he'll be released. The villain, of course, broke the promise and shot him down and he died. People called it a hero. I would definitely had call him a crackbrain.",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 19, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fac840bc37,5
"I can't stop talking about this show – I love it so much! I know this is a rough start to a review, but I don't care. I can't even begin to scratch the surface of why this anime and manga is just the best EVER. Especially now that 'The One Piece' is soon entering the anime world, I think the only valid criticism it might face (pacing) will disappear entirely. Though, I fear I will always love this version so much more. There's something magical about some of the filler episodes, where the characters interact without any real stakes, like G-8 early on. This series has it all: complex characters and dynamics, social commentary, soul-crushing moments, and moments that will make you laugh until your stomach hurts. There's immense world-building and lore that unfolds immersively. The characters are so compelling that most of them could have their own show, and I would tune in every time. The show lets you get to know the characters well in the pre-time skip, before its soul-crushing introduction to the time skip where things take a more serious turn. In the pre-time skip, the characters are the most compelling element. In post time-skip , the mysteries of the world, intriguing character lore , and the world-building and action take center stage. It becomes entrancing to the point where I would watch 100 episodes in less than a week and regularly lose sleep because I had to know what happens next. By the time I caught up, I cried for hours because I would never experience going into this show for the first time again. Anyway, watch 'One Piece'; you won’t regret it. It’s a journey for the ages!",10,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d3b1860b7b,5
"If you told me from a year ago I would watch One Piece, I would genuinely laugh but here I am fully caught up on the anime and manga and being one of the biggest fans. I can't put into words how much my love for one piece is, it was a journey for me, a long one but one I don't regret at all. Coming home and watching it, seeing the characters go through arcs and difficulties was just amazing and I felt so invested in it. Some of my favourite things about this anime are of course the cast of characters, main ones and side, each being so perfect that there's not a single arc's characters I disliked, the world is so detailed and planned out perfectly, the antagonists which are all so good in their own unique ways, the story arcs and how each are actually significant and don't get thrown away as the plot progresses, the entertainment and comedy, the fights and emotions, I could go on for hours. I can understand why people get turned off from the length, I do agree that the pacing is bad but mindlessly hating or watching it not to enjoy but to force yourself will never make you like One Piece. I'd say start it if you genuinely want to, if you actually watch One Piece with no bias, no matter what age you are you'll love it. It may seem like a kiddy show but I've been watching it for years and haven't gotten sick of it at all.

"So, it's a shounen, a goofy and silly shounen indeed, but I think what it fills even better is being a prime example of what not to be. So the art. It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down. It has now become a running joke amongst my friends, I guess it has that going for it.",1,Not Recommended,"Nov 2, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ea22a0938e,5
"Hi there. This is my first review and i hope that most of you wil find it helpful.One piece is one of the best animes ive seen so far.I started off with naruto and bleach, and then later One piece after my friend told me about it.He was like&quot;Man there's this amazinggg anime called one piece that you should start watching, im alredy on episode 57,im hooked on to it,i cant stop watching ....BlahBlahBlah&quot;.So,when i got home i watched the first episode of OP and said&quot;wat the @#$%^&quot;.(at the beginning of the anime)The effects and quality( art )of the anime were horrible and the main character looked like a complete retard(to me).And i knew that there was no way i was gona get hooked on to this anime.I called up my friend and told him about it, and he said that thats what he also thought at first ,but after watchin a few episodes he completely changed his mind.So i decided to watch a few more episodes. Without even realizing it i was drawn into the anime(by the time you get to episodes 20-30 it gets intresting).The story got way better as i progressed through the anime and i enjoyed every single episode i watched. The characters also got way better. The main caracter (whom i thought was a retard at first) became my favorite anime character. He's cool (although he doesnt look it) and funny and will make you laugh so hard till you cry( this also applies to the other characters). Some fighting scenes(main ones)in the anime are INSANE, the music is beautiful,and the sad scenes in the anime will bring you soo close to tears( many people actually cried. i wsnt one of them....BELIEVE ME, I WASNT!!. but i got close to crying). The art and sound in the anime also get a lot better later on but you wouldnt really care about them bcz youd be soo hooked on to the anime by the that time.I dont wanna write so much so ill just end this by saying that for those of you who havent started watchin this anime..START NOW!!! ,cause ull regret it if you dont.SAYONARA!!!",10,Recommended,"Nov 27, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1f27181bff,5

"To start off, I had seen quite a few episodes of one piece as a child on toonami, prior to even discovering what anime was in fact. From the very beginning I had adored this show, even watching the horrendous dubs on american television. To speak of the dubs, do not judge one piece by these. PLEASE. For God's sake don't hate one piece or anything about it because of what 4kids decided to do to it. Simply put they took something of masterpiece and full of depth into a shallow, horrid voice acting, and choppy version of the original. Funimation has done quite a decent job of recreating the dubbed version, but nothing can compete with the original, as the original is what it was meant to be like. Also, do not dismiss this lovely anime because of the earlier animation style of the first few episodes (as well as the more cartoony based style.) To dismiss something because of the artwork is no good reason to not watch it. THe characters are so unique and so original, and each character has meaning. Oda (the author) goes into complete detail with each of his characters. Even creating the characters in all of the filler episodes. What I can say about the story is that I have never laughed harder, sobbed more intensely, or fangirled more viciously than in this anime. The pure plot of this anime is so in depth and so intricate that I have re watched it several times (yes, all 554 episodes) So many people I come in contact with ask me ""How in the WORLD do you watch something so long? I just can't start now it's too overwhelming."" Well, let me tell you. I got so into this I was watching about 20-30 episodes daily. Just from the fact that I couldn't get enough of this anime. I really couldn't. It's starts off as a regular kind of pirate scenario where everyone wants to become the best. What really caught me is the fact that it takes every type of pirate ""legend"" or mystery and puts it into a reality. Sea monsters, crazy powers, evil marines, everything. What also caught me is starting out with one boy and one dream, and making that dream seem more and more real by the battles and crew-mates he finds along his adventure. I guess I like the flavor of starting off small and crawling your way to strength and ambition, but this anime just packs that flavor into one huge ice cream sundae. With a friggen cherry on the very top. I really have only praise for this masterpiece. Unforgettable characters, amazing scenery, endless adventure. Simply put.

"ok, let me just start by saying that approx 25 episodes in (with my friends pushing and screaming at me to continue watching) i got caught up in the storm. Every arc begins calmly, and ends in shock/epic , and they always do it right. With this many episodes, theyve set a parallel universe in our minds, and all this is due to 50% Luffy and 50% everything else: because Luffy, although he looks simple, is just the ultimate favorite character i have ever seen in all the animes i can think of. and i have never seen a more powerful redefining of the word CONFIDENCE in all my life. if you havent seen it, what are you waiting for...",10,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eeeea99da5,6
"One Piece: Is it the most overrated anime of all? If this simple sentence was enough to insult me and provoke a 'confusing' reaction, you probably belong to the group I'm about to mention. The reason I say this is that, despite the incredible nature of this work, its community tends to overly praise it without any objectivity, portraying it as a perfect masterpiece. If you dare to say anything degrading about it, you are simply criticized and insulted. Personally, this significantly impacted my critical opinion when I decided to delve seriously into this work. It had been hyped up so much as a flawless creation that when I discovered it for myself, I was disappointed because it didn't live up to the expectations set for me. This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy what I saw and discovered; it simply means that the community negatively influenced my view of the series. With the final saga just beginning in the anime, I felt compelled to share my comprehensive opinion on this incredible series, One Piece! One of One Piece's biggest strengths, in my opinion, is the vastness of its universe. The various landscapes, characters, and connections between different places create a fantastic sense of constant discovery, making us feel the immensity of the world we're immersed in. This is a testament to the author's skill; you can feel Eiichirō Oda's dedication to his work and how well he knows and masters the universe he created. He can create links between episodes that only come to fruition 500 episodes later, leaving us in awe and saying, 'Wow, so that's what it was!' Another incredible aspect is One Piece's ability to appeal to a wide audience. While it may seem childish on the surface due to its humor, vibrant colors, and rounded character designs, it also has depth and addresses complex subjects like slavery (Celestial Dragon), racism (Fish-Men), poverty, and many other profound themes. It took me a while to realize how remarkable it is for One Piece to tackle such deep topics! Now, let me discuss what personally displeased me in One Piece. Although it's also a strength I mentioned, the childish aspect was sometimes too prominent for my taste. It took me a long time to adapt to One Piece's style, and in the Alabasta saga, I was frustrated by Bon Clay's character. It annoyed me to see such an eccentric character in the midst of a serious battle that could cost him his life and the lives of many others. It detracted from the seriousness of the arc and the importance of the events. I'm not against One Piece's humor, but I was often frustrated when it took up a significant space during serious and crucial arc events. I don't like to judge the plot until it's finished, especially as I write this message when the final saga is just beginning, promising to be rich in revelations. I'm somewhat skeptical about the Devil Fruit-based power system. I appreciate the credibility given to powers in anime like Naruto or Hunter x Hunter, currently, we're simply told that it's a fruit granting a specific power with a curse. I find it somewhat simplistic, but perhaps the final saga will provide more information! This point primarily addresses the anime, but the pacing is painfully slow. In simple terms, to ensure the anime never catches up to the manga, One Piece follows a pace of approximately 1 Chapter = 1 Episode. It's very slow; a seasonal anime like Chainsaw Man operates at around 3.5 Chapters = 1 Episode. The value varies depending on the arcs, but during Wano Kuni, it reached 0.6 Chapters = 1 Episode. I don't know if you realize how slow the progression is! It's sad, but if One Piece had been a seasonal anime, it would have concluded in barely 400 episodes instead of the soon-to-be 1100! One Piece's musicality is quite good with its OST, immersing us well in the universe. However, I was somewhat disappointed with the Opening/Ending songs. Apart from the cult classic ""We Are,"" none have truly left a lasting impression—they're justified in not being extraordinary. The animation has continuously evolved; the early episodes were truly awful, but the animation improved with the anime's popularity, culminating in the Wano Kuni arc, which was exceptional in style and animation quality! In conclusion, despite the long and challenging journey, much like the Mugiwara's adventure, I would recommend this work to anyone. It's an incredible universe waiting to be discovered. NO, One Piece is not a perfect anime or manga, just like any other work. However, it remains exceptional, and I invite everyone to embark on the Vogue Merry to start this long journey and discover all that One Piece has to offer!""",8,Recommended,"Jan 11, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_99e6610141,6
"More than 25 years ago a little rubber-boy popped out of a barrel on a fat ladies pirate ship, and little did the world know at the time but that rubber boy would be the main character of one of the greatest stories ever told. What might seem like a silly show about pirates is deep down a story about political corruption with themes of slavery, war, and more. With the end of One Piece's fast approach, I recommend you start watching sooner than later because once what the one piece is is revealed, it will be almost impossible to watch the show without that massive spoiler. If you are still hesitant not to give one piece a shot then I, The Real Big Fat Guy, will tell you why one piece is one of the greatest stories to ever be told. Side Note: there is a lot I really want to talk about with this review due to one piece being such a grand series. Its almost impossible to talk about all those things without spoilers. So if there is going to be a major spolier, then I will put (spoiler) before it and (end) at the end of it so you can skip that section. Lets start with the negatives We all know the main one: The pacing is absolutely horrible. All of the earlier Shonen were released on a weekly basis unlike the seasonal route most shows go today. other shows of the time like Naruto deals with this fast production of episodes by creating non-canon, 10-30 episode filler arcs. Although most of these filler arcs are horrible they can be easily skipped over and it wont take away from the experience of the show. One Piece was like I am not doing all that and what it does instead is hundreds of times worse. along with the occasional 4 episode filler arc, One Piece also fluffs up the canon episodes to drag it out. This basically drags the episode out to include the filler within it. What the anime does is stretch out panels in the manga that should take up one or two seconds of the anime (like running or crowds of people) to 6-12 seconds in the episode. This is very apparent in the ""running episodes"". There are episodes in the arcs before the big fight that involves the characters running to get to a location or problem. There are full episodes that consist of just running that really sucks. its not one or two episodes either. at its peak annoyance, arcs like dressrosa, Punk Hazard, and Fishman Island have a solid 60 ""running episodes"". The worst part is it isn't even skippable unlike filler arcs because in between those 15 minutes of running, there are 5 minutes of significant plot stuff. If you cant handle the pacing and don't watch one piece because of that, I totally understand it. I'd recommend the manga or to just wait for the Netflix/WIT animations version which is going to be seasonal which is what the anime should have been in the first place. Another bad part of the show is how Oda handles killing off characters, or should I say how he doesn't kill of characters. Unless you physically see a character get a massive hole in them then don't ever think a character is dead. (the rest of this section is a spoiler) There are so many people who just die and come back like nothing happened: Pell, Bon clay, Bon Clay again, Pekoms, Jack, Sabo, Bellamy, Sky island dad, Gecko Moria, Brownbeard, and most recently Saul. With someone like Sabo or Bon clay (the first time) is understandable because they play an important role later in the series, but with someone like the sky island dad who tragically and heart-wrenchingly sacrificed himself to Enel's lightning to save his daughter. Then he just walks back Scot-free for absolutely no reason. Just a second ago this mf was looking like Ash Ketchum after Charizard blows fire in his face in disobedience and now he's fine. Its not even like he plays an important role in the story so why ruin his tragic sacrifice The most famous example is Pell. There is a whole dramatic chapter were Pell says his final goodbyes to Vivi before flying that bomb (which by the way, HAS THE POWER TO BLOW UP THE ENTIRE CAPITAL CITY) into the air to sacrifice himself for the people in the city. ten chapters later and he waddles up to his tombstone and has the audacity to ask why they think he died. MF YOU TOOK A NUCLEAR BOMB TO THE FACE, EVEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD A COUPLE EPISODES AGO. not only is that ""dramatic chapter"" were he says his goodbyes so cringey now, but it takes away from the from the emotion of the show. What good did keeping Pell alive do? He hasn't come back to help the straw hats like Sabo and Bon clay (the first time) did, and he came back right at the end of Alabasta so he didn't do anything else that arc. All this did was loose the emotion and also One Piece's credibility. Because of all these Fake out deaths, I wouldn't be surprised if Ace came back riding on whitebeards shoulders because there happened to be a guy with the Undonut fruit at Marineford or something. (end of spoilers) The comedy doesn't land most of the time. Some jokes do it but that is very occasional. Then again, most other Shonen's comedy doesn't land most of the time either so if I'm deducting points on one piece for its mediocre comedy all other Shonen's with mediocre comedy is getting deducted too. However, there is this one moment I cannot overlook because a bad gag had plot relevance. (very minor spoilers for fishman) Sanji's Perviness has always been Unfunny nuisance at best, but in the Fishman island arc Sanji is so turned on by the big-titty Mermaids that he does the anime thing were he shoots blood out of his nose and ALMOST DIES OF BLOOD LOSS. (end) In what world is that funny? To be fair, Fishman island would still be a bad arc without this moment but it genuinely ruined his character until the whole cake arc saved his likability. And that's all I could think of. I didn't mention the minor inconsistencies with devil fruits (like how it was mentioned at Alabasta that there were only 5 devil fruits that could make you fly despite 900 chapters later there are well over 20 that have some flight power with it). one piece has been going on for 2 and a half decades of course some things are going to be forgotten. plus it doesn't take away from the overarching story. I also didn't talk about the Fishman island arc but just to touch on it, everything One Piece does well before Fishman island is thrown out the window, and all of the things One Piece does not so well is intensified. Now with the good: The World Building is the best in animanga. i won't touch on this too much because its very obvious but Oda has created the most developed world in all of anime and maybe even fiction itself. Not with just the geography of the world, but with everything as a whole. Every place the Straw hats travel to has a fully fleshed out culture, community, people, landscape, etc. Every location connects to an overarching plot. There are little plot points that are teased at the start of the series that come hundreds of chapters later. No other series come close to One Piece in terms of Emersion. No character feels left behind. There are characters that you think will only be a character in an arc or two that came back 10 arcs later and turn out to be an important character in a storyline. (spoilers) when you first met jewelry bonnie and Kuma, they were two separate characters that played two side character roles in two separate arcs. But turns out they are family, and not half cousins twice removed or something stupid, they are (adopted) father and daughter. Same thing with Laboon and Brook, same thing with Dragon and Sabo, same thing with dragon and luffy, same thing with Jinbe, Arlong, and Tiger, Same thing with so many other characters. (end) there are also characters that just come back for no reason but they somehow make a good addition. (spoilers) Bege just randomly comes back in wholecake and becomes an MVP in that arc. I dont know why but it just makes sense. (end) There is very few forgotten characters and think lots of those ""forgotten characters"" are going to come back in some way. The emotion in One Piece is very top notch. I don't like the Fake out deaths but the one good thing I will say about it is it makes it so when a character does die it tear jerking. We all know which example I'm thinking of. One Piece does this thing where they give some random ass side character some tragic backstory. For example, There is a character named Senor pink who is just another wacky member of Doflamingos crew. This guy is a fully grown chubby man that wears baby clothes and a diaper but he happens to have one of the most tragic backstories in al of the anime. So many moments just give you the chills. I watched Fujitoras speech at the end of Dressrosa I got goosebumps. Even if you decide not to watch One Piece by the end of this review I beg you to please just watch the One Piece fan letter episode. Its just amazing. It does what no other anime i have seen has done before and shows the One Piece world through the perspective of a background character. As of Wano, The animation has become top notch. Especially with impact frames. just when I thought the animation couldn't get any better Egghead rolled around and blew up all my expectations. Its very scary how One pieces current animation is that good when its just a weekly series. Its better than some seasonal anime's animation which is really saying something. One Piece has two great power systems. Devil Fruits are Unique. They aren't as good as Stands or Nen but it works well for a series like one piece. There are so many unique devil fruits and the added drawback of not being able to swim is something actually worth thinking about before you eat them because the entire world is mostly water. There was a problem with devil fruits though. out of the 3 types of devil fruits, Logia were by far the most overpowered. To remedy this Oda added Haki. most of the time, adding another power system to a Shonen makes the original power system obsolete. For example, the addition of Stands in Jojos completely removed Hamon from the story. One Piece blends both power systems together really well. To succeed in the New World you either need members on your crew with Strong Haki or members on your team with an overpowered Devil fruit. Marineford is the best arc of all time. I'm not even going to explain, Feel free to disagree but you're wrong. Ngl I'm kind of getting tired of writing so ima just end it here. I could go on about the Character Development, The foreshadowing, Luffy as a Main character, the power of friendship, how it portrays real world corruption of power, Its diverse cast, I could go on and on but i'm lazy and I've done enough Dick-Riding today.

Its one of the most complex and captivating stories ever told. I wish I could go back and watch One Piece for the first time because what a time that was. If you haven't watched One Piece I encourage you to please give it a shot. Watch up to the Arlong park arc, and if you decide to keep going after that maybe, just maybe, you will see why One Piece has changed the lives of millions of people across the globe.

"One Piece is a great example of that saying ""Too much of everything is bad"". Story: 6/10 Had I only watched half of the series, then I would've given it a 10/10 score. Because One Piece is actually good, really good! - at least up until Marineford Arc - after that, the story became overly dramatic. It's as if the author himself wasn't able to move on from the reactions that Marineford arc has received - thus he started using it a lot of times to give Luffy and Ace' fans some emotional scenes - it was effective at first, but he did it too much to the point that it has lost it's effect. Overly huge size boobs - Most female characters suddenly have those overly huge boobs (especially Nami and Robin) it was used too much for fan service so the attention for the characters were often divided between their bouncing boobs and what they were doing. Another thing that I didn't like is the way that SH crew members were separated. What I really love in One Piece, is the relationship between SH crew members - that strong friendship that they built during their journey - that family like bond that they have. They cry and laugh together, face different problems together and solve them all together - I really miss that part of this series. Art: 6/10 One Piece had that unique animation and art style but after that time skip, it changed drastically. The characters are no longer as good looking as before. Sound: 5/10 The opening and ending songs weren't really my type so I often skipped them after listening to it once. Although the sound effects and musical scores that they use during emotional and intense fights scenes are really good. Character: 9/10 The main characters are still the same. They grew up and changed a lot, compared to how they were when they were introduced the first time - although they are still as hilarious as ever. There are some new characters that were introduced...they were interesting at first but they didn't left a strong impression on me...they are not the type that I will miss once they are gone.

"One piece is a classic anime, brilliantly done with an amazing creative flare for imagination by the author. It is set in a fictional world that is divided into 4 major oceans (East, West, North, South) which meet in the centre in a place called the ""grand line"". This is supposedly a legendary place where very powerful pirates live and constantly search for the great treasure of the deceased pirate king, ""one piece"". The story follows the life of a teenager, ""Monkey D. Luffy"", who has the ability to stretch his body in any way and holds the properties of rubber. He is an extrovert character who is both stupid in personality, eats way too much food and is completely unreasonable when he wants something. His personality is almost equal to that of Goku from Dragonball, Naruto and Natsu from fairy tail. This criticism exists that one piece is another shounen anime with the same stereotypical protagonists. This is true, however, it is still the great original shounen anime and if you enjoyed any of the above you will love this one too. The anime is quite old and currently has over 650 episodes, this makes starting the anime for some people non viable due to the old graphics not being in tip top condition. YOU GET USED TO IT; and the graphics improve over time. There are tonnes of mysteries in this anime that are still being debated (which i will not spoil). Character wise there is great versatility and for some of you anime lovers there are parts where the ecchiness and comedy gets off the charts, but because Luffy is a character who doesn't understand the concept of ""mature relations"" (*cough...sex) they do not develop. If you want to watch a great anime with incredibly interesting fights and imaginative powers (called devil fruit powers in their world. E.g. control of the elements, alter your body, create earthquakes, control shadows etc...) then one piece is right for you.",9,Recommended,"Nov 11, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_893a0c9b92,6
"A short reivew for the reader without much time: Story (7/10): The story is typical of a shonen anime, a team of friends going on a mission to find something they want. Each of the arcs are a battle against another pirate gang. Art (8/10): The art is what one first notices about One Piece. It is unusual and makes the series unique. However, people judge the anime for its art, and this doesn't do it justice. Just watch the anime, and you will notice the art works well with the anime. Sound (6/10): The music is interesting, and doesn't exactly match the anime, but is still a pretty good choice. Character (9/10): The characters are what make this anime. They are all unique in their personality and design. Their fighting techniques are all interesting in their own way, and all add to the comedy of the anime.

"One Piece is of the least enjoyable anime shows I have ever watched, or least it ended up being that. (No story spoilers, only allusions to some events) OP itself is a quite funny, sometimes pretty emotional, relatively exciting shounen show with a unique and sizable universe, even though the writing lacks oftentimes in terms of consistency in the characters' behavior, unnecessary asspulls, emotional manipulation by the author (e.g. fakeout deaths) and characters devoid of any interesting personality traits (mostly minor antagonists). My biggest gripe with OP has always been the longer arcs with drawn out battle sequences that last far too long and bear almost zero consequences for the whole franchise. It's a really fun adventure story when the characters are allowed to find out stuff about the world, but the author more and more ends up forcing the Straw Hats into long-winded battle-shounen frenzies where they fend off some of the least memorable ""bad guys"" I had yet to witness in shounen works. I don't think One Piece is a bad story, but it has an abundance of issues with characterizations of important characters (some major antagonists regularly ruin their own ""grand plans"" just by being stupidly written, there is rarely a good reason for them to self-manipulate the way they are) and is definitely more suited for a very young audience (early teens) but still somewhat enjoyable for people of any age group thanks to its plump humor and gorgeous art style (aside from a lot of women's faces looking the same). However, aside from the anime's story, Toei Animation's pacing of the latter half of the story so far ruins the entire vibe and sometimes adapts only about one or two handful of manga pages in a full 23 minute episode... The New World arcs are so horribly paced that I could not bear it anymore in Wano, even though this was the arc I was always looking forward to. Just read the manga if you're interested. If you have however no issues with horrible pacing similar to Dragon Ball Z etc., I guess you'd enjoy this as well..",4,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a5d17c058,6
"""One Piece is a never-ending dumpster fire of bloated bullshit. The pacing is a joke — it’s like they’re purposely trying to make you lose your will to live, dragging out every fight and arc for what feels like centuries. It’s like they think we can’t tell the difference between actual plot development and just filling time with random filler episodes that have no purpose other than to drag the series out longer. The same story beats keep getting recycled, and nothing ever feels like it’s actually progressing. Every time you think they’re about to wrap something up, here comes another pointless arc to waste your life away. And let’s talk about the animation for a second — it’s ridiculously over-the-top and childish. The fights are a mess of flashing lights and ridiculous moves that are more about spectacle than actual stakes. It’s like they’re more concerned with making every battle look like an explosion of colors than actually having a decent plot. Then there’s the constant, laughable power-ups. Every new transformation or move just gets more absurd, as if they’re trying to see how much nonsense they can throw at the screen before it collapses under its own weight. Nothing feels earned anymore, it’s just one big, never-ending series of cheap tricks to keep fans hooked. And don’t even get me started on the fanbase. They act like ""One Piece"" is this untouchable masterpiece that can't be criticized, but it’s a glorified pirate soap opera that’s been dragging on for way too long. Honestly, this show should’ve ended 700 episodes ago, but instead, it’s just an endless cash grab that’s wasting your time and brain cells. It's a franchise that’s become a parody of itself, and the worst part? People still defend it like it’s some grand, life-changing experience. Get over it — it’s just a cartoon, and it’s been out of ideas for years."" Also we need to talk about the idea of 'freedom' in One Piece ""One Piece has this twisted, childish idea of freedom that doesn’t even come close to reality. The author seems to think that freedom is just about doing whatever the hell you want with no consequences, like the world owes you something just because you want to live how you choose. Luffy and his crew prance around like they’re some kind of freedom fighters, but all they’re doing is running around causing chaos, stealing treasure, and trampling over everyone else’s lives for their own selfish goals. The idea that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, with no regard for anyone else is the *opposite* of true freedom. True freedom means understanding that your choices affect others. It’s not about being a reckless, self-centered idiot and acting like you're on some grand adventure. It's about being responsible for your own actions and respecting the rights and freedoms of those around you. But nope, in *One Piece*, freedom is just an excuse to do whatever the hell you want without thinking for a second about the consequences — just because you're a pirate with a dream. It’s a fantasy world where freedom is just a free pass to do whatever makes you feel good at the moment, no matter how many people get screwed over in the process. Luffy’s ‘freedom’ is nothing more than a lazy cop-out for not having to face the reality that freedom comes with accountability. But the show doesn’t want you to think that deeply about it. It just wants you to cheer for a guy who’s too busy acting like a child to ever actually grow up and understand what real freedom even means.""

"Let me just start off with saying this: if you need 750+ episodes and your story isn't even halfway over, you're a s*** writer. NO EXCUSES ODA. I've invested sooooo much time into the series but I'll be damned if I don't some day get a time machine so take it all back and do something productive with my life. Story: 2/10 - it's so ridiculously repetitive you'll want to cry. Protagonists go to island, island has some shit going on and the straw hats have to basically destroy the entire underground criminal organization of each freaking island, whether they just be lowly criminals terrorizing the city or the entire government of the island is corrupt. I understand that the Straw hats are the ""good guys"" but do they really have to overthrow the monarchy of every freaking island they land on I mean Jesus Christ. Characters: 3/10 - Each character has some tragic backstory and seem important until they just fade into the background of the straw hat crew because of Oda's complete inability to add any sort of profound depth to his characters. They are all the same as day 1, and they cling to the same annoying cliches even after they've been burned to the ground. Hey you know how brook is a skeleton? Ya let's make him say 50 million skull jokes it's not like those got old after the second time. Hey you remember how bad Zoro was with directions for the first 100 or so episodes? No? Well now he randomly can't walk straight without getting lost. Franky became considerably more lame after the time skip, personality and design wise, and as for the rest of the straw hats they are just ""OK"". Drama/realisim: (SPOILERS) -100/10 - Alright, do you guys remember when that bird dude took a f***ing nuke to the face and walked it off like it was nothing? That was pretty cool. Or how about when Doflammingo shot the living s*** out of trafalgar law after beating the crap out of him and piercing his chest multiple times and then we see him just a few episodes later with just a few scratches and bruises? Or how about when Jimbe got his f***ing organs obliterated by akainu and then lived to tell the tale like it was nothing? What about when Robin blew up igoram's ship in a HUGE pillar of fire and he returned to alabasta and we never even got an explanation as to what happened, he was just fine! Has a bomb even killed a single person in the series yet? Probably not, and that's pretty impressive considering taking a bomb to the face is like a daily ritual to these people. No matter who you are, civilian or hero; you will inevitably get blown up and be perfectly fine at some point in the series. What the f*** Oda, are all of your characters made out of adamantium or something? Since we know that Oda's a lil b**** who never kills anyone if it doesn't progress the story, this leads to a lot of ""Fake"" drama in the series. We know that even though that dude just got his face shot in by the evil guy, he's gonna be a-okay. This becomes downright insulting after the 500th time it happens. I know it's really only natural to worry about the safety of your friends after they've just been curb stomped into oblivion, but since no one ever dies in series, it makes you not care. This is not drama, it's just an overused cliche that the writers still think they can milk and get away with and it's lazy. sound: 5/10: nothing exceptional about it but it's okay. animation: 2/10: it sucks. Conclusion: If I could go back in time and tell younger me to just stick a fork in the outlet instead of watching this show, I would do it in a heartbeat. Do not recommend, would rather have robin gouge eyes out while nami repeatedly sticks me with the clim-atacck while brook tells more more stupid skeleton jokes until I die.",4,Not Recommended,"Sep 8, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e1d6edf89a,6

"Maybe it's a bit late, but this year I decided to catch up with One Piece. I have seen 296 episodes so I think (and hope) I am eligible of writing a review. My native language is not English so bear with me if I make mistakes of any kind. Also this is my first review. If someone would ask me to review this show in one sentence I would tell him the following: ""This show is a masterpiece"". I have to note that this review is solely based on my opinion and everyone has the right to have an opinion should that be bad or good. I am not saying that other people are wrong. So, let's start the review... Story The story is the greatest I have seen in a anime. It has a bit of everything: drama, comedy, action. At first it may seem that this is a comedy anime, but the more you watch it the more surprised you will be, because of the seriousness this show can deliver when it is needed. It has a perfect balance between comedy and drama. The story can be so deep that at some point you may even shed a tear. Art Despite of all the negative things people said about the art, I, personally really enjoy it. I can say that from the first episode the art was great in my opinion, but it keeps getting better and better after each episode. After I saw some flashbacks of the first episodes I was really surprised of how much the art developed since then. Sound The sound of this show is really good. The OST (original soundtrack) really adds a good feel to the story. At the very dramatic moments it makes it even more dramatic, which is a really nice thing. Character One of the best thing in this show are the characters. The makers of this anime really made a good job bringing you close to the characters. I feel like I am on their ship, sailing with them and when they got some problems I can really feel their pain and suffering. The voice actors do a really great job (I watch it in Japanese version, I don't know about the English version, because I haven't seen it) and every character is unique in its own way. Enjoyment The enjoyment of this anime is outstanding. I could never get bored of it, because it keeps getting better every episode. Eiichiro Oda, the mangaka, does a great job in writing awesome stories with nice plot twists. Overall Overall this anime is a masterpiece.

"Long-time fans of this show have always sung all its praises to me, before adding the caveat of ""...but the pacing gets worse later on in the show"". ... ""Gets""? I'm sorry, ""GETS""?! I had to watch at double speed to get through Syrup Village. For those not familiar, it's one of the earliest arcs, and it's very short as far as one piece arcs go. Cut to one guy saying how he's gonna destroy the heroes. Cut to wide shot for demonstration of power, probably by attacking an inanimate object. Cut to reaction shot. Cut to a couple other reaction shots (about 7 seconds each) because you really need a separate *frame* for each facial expression to keep the viewer caught up. Cut to secondary villain on the side smirking and muttering about how currently-in-combat villain is one of the strongest of their group. Cut to reaction shot of a protagonist with eyes shaded out, ready to take on the villain. Protagonist mutters something intimidating. Then you see TO BE CONTINUED. The 20 minutes of your life have already been deposited, you can't cancel the transaction. There are plenty of things about the other aspects of the show to talk about, and even admire, but the pacing tanks everything so much that it's hard to think about anything else when thinking about this show. The story? There are great things about it, but there are also very formulaic things about it, which isn't inherently a problem unless one predictable and uninteresting fight becomes two hours of your life. The characters? They're still cool, but if you have to wait a year for them to do anything, you begin to get annoyed at them for not just wrapping things up. The humor? It's great in manga form, because your mind automatically adjusts the comedic timing of scenes in a still panel to however it likes, but when the anime draws out every reaction and punchline and adds the same corny wacky boingy sound effect to every single one, it's horribly unfunny. I could absolutely be wrong, but I have to assume that the majority, maybe even the vast majority, of people who earnestly recommend this show, started it as kids. I'd understand. I'm sure that I, as a kid, would not have cared. How one can watch this for the first time in their adult life and enjoy it is beyond me. Do try the manga.

"Character development was non-existent and the couple of times it did happen, it was a downgrade rather than an upgrade. This is a well known fact but I’ll chime in a little and talk about three characters in particular: Sanji, Nico Robin and Luffy. Let’s start with Sanji. Now, a lot of viewers like myself find his perverted behavior to be too cheesy, cringe and annoying. It used to be funny but now it’s just too dull and repetitive. We’ve been awaiting his character development for ages and when Pudding broke Sanji’s heart, that was literally the perfect moment for him to grow out of his childish infatuation with every stranger woman he comes across. It was a good chance for him to realize that there are toxic women among strangers who can hurt him like pudding did. What does the author do instead? Makes him an even bigger pervert than before. Seriously, well done Oda. Now let’s move on to robin. I especially hate what happened to her. She used to be such a cool and interesting character and was a fan favorite in the crew for many. During the time skip, many people thought that Robin like the rest of the crew would undergo a massive change where she gets stronger and gains new Intel from the revolutionary army which could assist the crew in interesting ways while maintaining her cool and mysterious persona but instead, she returns as a (excuse my language) MILF and has been reduced to a background character. She’s basically eye candy now. As for the main character Luffy, he’s had the same personality at the age of 7 that he does now at the age of 19. Fights: The events surrounding the fights in one piece make no sense. There is almost no strategy or planning whatsoever whether the main character is breaking into the most secure military stronghold in the world (Enies lobby) or a world-class prison (Impel down). Luffy just barges right in and from there on out, plot armor carries him to victory. Do note that the opponent is supposed to be stronger than Luffy. Not just luffy, his entire crew is separated to fight one-on-one against opponents which are stronger than them and somehow, every single enemy will lose whilst every single straw hat will win. What makes it worse is that there is almost no suspense or suspicion for the future because you already know that everyone fighting on Luffy’s side is going to survive.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 23, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_57a6fb0428,7
"At first you think that One Piece is a typical Shonen with ridiculous fights and shitty drawing. In fact, these two never improve. But there are things that make One Piece soooooo... much better than Bleach, Naruto and even Hunter x Hunter. And these things are the story, characters, foreshadowing and the unique One Piece universe. There are also nice concepts about will inheritance, man's dreams and giving up personal goals for the sake of close friends/relatives. Ok. So here are my scores: Art: 0/10 Music: 0/10 Fights: 0/10 World design: 0/10 Characters: 10/10 Story: 50/10 So Overall: 60/60. Deal with it. The problem with One Piece is that you need to understand all these foreshadowings, concepts and not complain about PIS's (Plot Induced Stupidities) which can be quiet difficult. So there will be a problem if you are mature enough to see all the stupid and ridiculous things but not mature enough to enjoy the good things. P.S.

"I don't know how to start writing this review because I don't know how to type what emotions I go through while watching this anime (and often days after). But the biggest feeling I get is awe. Awe with jaw drops and goosebumps. One top of that there's hilarious comedy, some tearful moments and conveyed anger. That is a part of what makes up my favourite anime of all time, One Piece. Even though I would think most know the basics of One Piece, I'll go through it again. There once lived a man named Gol D. Roger who was given the title The Pirate King. At his moment of execution, he announced that his greatest treasure, One Piece, is hidden away in 'that place' and invited anyone to find it. This brought The Great Age of the Pirates and many men set out to the sea to find One Piece and become Pirate King. The story follows Luffy, probably the most lovable hero you'll ever come across. He aims to become Pirate King and sets out on a journey through the seas to wholeheartedly follow his goal. He first plans to gather his crew members and a ship to then journey through the greatest and toughest seas, The Grand Line. Story 10/10 - The story One Piece follows is very unique, not just in comparison to other animes but also Hollywood. You might say, 'Pirates, big whoop, it's been done before' but I have no words to express how wrong you'd be. I wasn't a fan of the pirate genre (unless it had Johnny Depp in it) but One Piece opened my eyes. The plot is solid and I have to say that Oda knows how to tie everything together perfectly. There's nothing that doesn't happen for a reason in this anime. There aren't many useless fillers or completely pointless arcs. As the story moves further, you'll find yourself getting more and more attached. Sound 10/10 - The sound is brilliant. The music gets you leaning forward in your seat, eyes wide, grips hardened (hmm, sounds too much like a H-anime but you get what I mean). Without the music to braze together everything, I doubt One Piece would be worth half its value. The moods are set perfectly and I yet have to pick out a moment where a sound theme has even been a second too late or early. I get so hyped up when hearing certain music themes. Every character also has their own theme song which is just done perfectly to suit the character. Another thing that suits the characters is the laugh each character is given with their persona, each unique. Art 10/10 - I do admit I was one of those people who put off One Piece for a long time because I didn't like the art. I don't know if my vision was lacking because now that I can finally see, it is truly spectacular art. I thought the character design seemed half done but it couldn't suit each person more. The background art has always been beyond standards with certains scenes where you just want to pause and stare at. After the time skip, the art becomes more modern (by that I mean crisp). The characters have a new added gloss but they still have the style unique to One Piece. The main thing which I love about the animation is that there are regular costume changes for the characters. So you never sit through it and wonder if they actually are stinky pirates with scurvy. Characters 10/10 - Probably the strongest point of One Piece, as it should be for any anime (unfortunately this is too much to ask for in most cases). Luffy is an unwavering character who will always do what he thinks is right. He is childish and a bit spoilt but this makes him the person who everyone is drawn to. He doesn't chase any unnecessary romances, his mind is set to his one goal to become Pirate King. I have never heard (and doubt I ever will hear) anyone mention anything along the lines of 'I dislike Luffy'. The other main characters are also just as worthy. Zoro's determination makes him one of my favourite characters, also because he's just boss with his santoryu. Nami is a theif whose main interest is money and navigating but isn't that a true pirate? Her cunning ways make her the awesome character she is. Usopp is well Usopp. He's a liar and a coward just as his name states but he brings about the greatest character development because I have to say that I absolutely hated him at the start. Sanji is just kickass (it's a pun because he kicks to fight). His overly love towards women does become occasionally annoying but he is an amusing and strong character. Chopper, is a cotton candy loving reindeer often mistakened as a tanuki (racoon). He is a cute, lovable, funny character who can become something else when pushed. Robin is a smart character whose wit always has you thinking how cool she is. Franky is a suuppeerr character. He's strong and really funny. Brook is a very unique person. He's a hentai whose jokes always make you crack up laughing. All of these characters come with unique back stories and a purpose which I just love. The supporting characters of One Piece have been given so much of thought. Many characters grow to become your favourites. Characters such as Ace, Whitebeard, Mihawk, Shanks, Hancock, even though they don't play the main role, it feels as though a lot of thought has been poured into them. There have also been characters who were purposely created to hate, like the tenryuubito. All in all, the character section makes up the main traits of One Piece. Overall 10/10, I don't think I can give this any other score. It is an anime for all ages and I promise you that you will never regret watching it. One Piece isn't just something for entertainmemt, it's become a part of my life.",10,Recommended,"Nov 9, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_02e892daf5,7

Friendship is one of the most important values in this show, and this anime has always managed to make a smile on my face and at times inspired me in many ways. Which are a couple of reasons why i like this Anime. I really love this anime, and i am very grateful to Eiichiro Oda-sensei for creating this wonderfull masterpiece of his. If you haven't started watching this anime yet, i strongly reccomand it to you. (And i'm talking about the original Japanese version. I do not recommend the 4Kids English Dub version.

"OK this is my first review so here it goes, One Piece(OP) is a fantastic story about friendship, hard work, determination, and chasing your dreams. This show was one of the first animes that i ever watched and inspired me to continue watching anime. If you like idiotic humor, kick-ass action, and a touching story with very lovable characters, One Piece is the show for you. Story 10/10 This story is all about the voyage of Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers up crew members and they experience many trials that will test their friendship and ultimately deepen their bond as they sail across the Grand Line. I love how this story develops early on as the original members are acquired. Not only are they accompanying Luffy and aiding him on his journey, but they are also chasing their own dreams as well. Now, about the oh so familiar fillers, compared to the other long running animes OP isn't jammed packed with fillers. In the beginning it moves pretty fast but as it catches up to the manga the story definitely slows in pace. Although there are less fillers, they are present but i found them to be very enjoyable. There are multiple filler arcs that last for multiple episodes but they fit in perfectly with the story. The reason these arcs are so enjoyable are because of the characters. Characters 10/10 The main characters of OP are definitely my favorite part about the show. They all have great personalities that compliment each other. There are the idiot comic relief members,the voice of reason members, the bad-ass members, and the weak/support type characters of the crew. I'm not going to sit here and say that i love every character every episode; i've had my fair share of times were each has angered me in the way. But it's that exact feeling that makes you fall in love with the crew. Just like our own friends we have all had times when we hated our friends and its times like those that help friendships grow to be even stronger then before. The ups and downs of the crew as they grow to be closer nakama (a term VERY often used in the show) will have you yearning for more as you begin to hope for their dreams as much as they do. Sound 10/10 Music is also a huge part of OP and adds a lot to the overall feel of the show. First off the opening songs for the show never disappoint and i find the opening to set the mood and can get you pumped each episode in a season. Not only are the opening songs fantastic, but each character has his own theme music. Each character has his or her own BGM that play when its his/her time to shine. Art 9/10 OP's art is good and unique, that being said i still think it is a step down from other popular series (like Naruto or Bleach). By no means is it bad, i find its subtle uniqueness to be very appealing if you're looking for something a little bit different. I enjoy watching and couldn't imagine the characters portray any other way. Overall 10/10 I love this show and it is definitely one of my favorites. It is a great shounen battle and i highly recommend it to anyone willing to take the 500+ episode leap. As someone who watched 415 episodes basically nonstop and has been watching it weekly ever since. It is never too soon, and never too late, to take the journey with Luffy and his crew across the Grand Line on a rollercoaster of emotion for the ultimate treasure ONE PIECE.",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d558c0348,7
"Let me start by saying that i also though that an anime about a guy made of rubber with a hat made of straw seemed pretty dumb. One Piece is about Luffy whose ambition is to find a treasure, One Piece, and become the King of Pirates. To achieve that, he assembles several friends along his journey and has to face many strong opponents. This anime is VERY addicting and after watching a dozen of episodes you will want to watch all of them for sure. Normally, its quite a comical anime and with lots of fights. Nevertheless, it has some more serious parts that make it an outstanding anime and gives it more intensity.",9,Recommended,"Dec 23, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a7ea4617d7,7
"Ok everything about this anime it's outstanding, in my opinion One Piece is the Best shounen anime Ever. Now let us start: STORY: It's story is Adorable a masterpiece that was named One Piece, the real deal and the good part is not only about that pirate king that hid one treasure, but it is those countless men that went out to search for it! Thrilling and exiting a story that had many anime-watchers riveted. ART: The art is Awesome the animation was fixed a little after some 200 eps(or so) every detail every part that is important for the viewer to understand the situation is being drew excelently CHARACTER: I think that the characters are one of the most outstanding things in One Piece. For starters the main character the one that wants to become king of the pirate is UNIQUE, moreover other characters are so weird and peculiar and by using them the anime is far more intersting and fun. ENJOYMENT: Not much about the enjoyment i just have to say that when an episode finishes i was like: ""i want more One Piece!!"" Now to conclude every thing about this anime is so well organized, the anime is perfect in sooo many genres it has Great action- Hillarious situations- Sad situations- Many teachings- Tremendous adventures Watch it... You MUST watch it.",10,Recommended,"May 29, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4ada05bba8,7
"If you asked me about One Piece, i would tell you that it's one, if not the greatest shounen ever, with fun characters, great adventure, fights, feels and backstories. Once you specify that you're talking about the Anime? Oh boy. The adaptation is done by Toei animation. At first it wasn't terrible. The animation has always been kinda Meh but i can take that without that many issues. However, in the Skypiea Arc i've noticed a reused soundeffect from Dragon Ball (the fuck?) and i started to get a little salty about the adaptation. After the 2 year time skip it was getting worse and worse, animation, sound, pacing, comedy. All of it was getting worse by the minute. Now, at around episode 820 the issues are worse than ever. You see, the anime is catching up to the manga, but they don't want to stop cranking out the anime, nor do they want to go the Filler route. So instead they stretch it out as much as possible. So much so that about half of the ""content"" in the current anime epsodes, isn't in the manga. For example, the fights. In the manga they are emotional and hype. In the anime, you see them talk for 3 minutes, than it's gonna focus on someone else, than it gets back, a single punch is landed (that you see in stillshot for 2 minutes), than it cuts to other characters talking for 5 minutes......you get the point. Not only that the pacing gets fucked up like this. They often try to add comedic moments to make it more bearable. Except they fail. Hard. What you have now is such a chaotic and slow development of characters plot, butchered comedy and basically everything else that's been altered by toei is shit too. Stuff that takes a chapter in the manga, takes 3 episodes in the anime. Not only that, but at the start of each episode, there's a ""recap"" of the last episode, then opening, then stuff happens (but not really), then there is ending and preview for the next episode. Just like that, 24 minute episode has 12 minutes of the actual anime, which consists out of 8 minutes of exposition, 2 minutes of stillshots and 2 minutes of actual content. One piece is great, don't take me wrong. Hell at the start of the anime, it was pretty good, but as time went on, it kept getting worse and worse and now i consider it borderline unwatchable. TL;DR If you want to experience the Magical journey that is One Piece, read the manga. the anime is a little over 820 episodes ATM so catching up will take you a while, and once you do catch up, there's no hype or emotion, just ruin and a hollow shell of the manga that's been beaten to death by toei.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 1, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b82551234f,7
"(No spoilers contained, and sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language + i'm still amateur on writting reviews) One Piece is one of the most popular anime/manga series. But i have to say that the manga is way better than the anime for sure. Not because of the few filler episodes, but for the slow pacing, which became more obvious in the recent years and the mediocre animation. But let's go further. Story: 9 The story is about Luffy who wants to become the king of pirates. He and his nakama, sail across the Grand Line to fulfil their dreams/goals. The story is simple, BUT you will see thousands of characters, different events, battles, sad-epic-happy moments. And that is what makes One Piece story more unique than other shounen series. There are some filler episodes, but it is a small amount of them. Art: 7 Despite the very mediocre animation, the art is good and it fits One Piece. There is no CGI, and the animation does get better throughout the series, but still, for the year of 2015, the animation is like being in 2003. Also, compared to the manga, the animation is childish. Anyway, the art is unique again, but here the unique is not that good. Sound: 8 The voice actors fit perfectly every One Piece character. The backround music also fits the atmosphere, and the content of the soundtrack is big. It rarely uses some soundtracks, and some of them can be listened in almost every episode. It's not the best content of soundtracks you'll hear, but they are the best for One Piece. Character: 10 This is what makes One Piece one of the best series of all time. Unique characters with their own backstories, awesome villains, both the main and secondary characters are amazing, and the secondary characters support the series in a great way. The motivations of the villains and their backstories will give you the thrills. Plus, the character develpoment of the main characters throughout the series is amazing. New fighting techinques, new relationships etc.. Enjoyment: 9 There are definetely many episodes ( currently there are almost 720 episodes) and sometimes there is some low pacing( especially in the past 2-3 years) and many of the arcs are huge (like 40+ episodes) but the story NEVER gets boring. Overall: 8 If you are a shounen fan, then One Piece is for you. Maybe not the best shounen anime out there, especially if you don't like an anime with so many episodes and somekind of childish content ( almost no blood in scenes where in the manga there is blood) but still, a popular anime with many fans. It is my favourite anime, but definetely not the best i've watched. By the way, don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that One Piece is for children, it's just that many scenes are censored, for no reason.

"To be clear, I've been following the OP manga since it began serialization, and I follow it religiously. One Piece is the most epic saga ever written. That being said, I pretty much despise the animated version, other than a handful of movies such as Chopper's Drun Island movie To sum it up, - bad animation...not only bad, so little content, yet they keep repeating frames - bad timing and awkward presentation of punchlines - excessive fanservice to the point of stupidity - overall bad directing. They always try too hard to look cool, yet they just can't pull it off. All of these points are probably quite subjective. Over the years I have tried to watch a few episodes here and there, but I couldn't stand it. Then I figured maybe the movies (Strong World) and OVA (3D2Y special) would be better...but no. Same issues that plague the TV, just with better quality animation. That and I can't fathom watching 700 episodes of a single series.

"Since the last review I wrote was a little overwhelmed by my fan-boying crap, well it was the first one I ever wrote tho, and I decided to be a little more objective about writing a review about One Piece. I, myself, really adore this one, but people mostly underrate it because it has many episodes, or is a little bit old. Anyways, let's begin. Story - 8/10 - The story is focused about Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who lived in the era known as ""The Great Age of Pirates"", which was encouraged by the great Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Altho the anime is really old(began airing in 1999), the story is very well writen, by my opinion. It currently has 683 episodes and is still ongoing and like every anime that has a lot of episodes, it does have quite much fillers indeed, and they can be really annoying I admit that. It also has somekind of a unique story, and that pirate theme is really awesome in some ways. You don't see much animes that have the pirate-theme in them. As I was saying, the story is really unique. Now, that were mostly pros of One Piece, but it has a few cons aswell. Like, the plots aren't such good ones, they're mostly predictable. This wasn't a spoiler, it was just a fact. Altho i watched every single arc from the beggining till the end, some of them aren't really needed there, they're fillers put in that way. Art - 6/10 - I rate the animation of this anime on a 6. I've taken into account that this anime dates from 1999, but even now the animation isn't such high-quality. Even if it is available in 1080p HD, it isn't very admirable, so I rated it a 6. Sound - 7/10 - Aswell as the animation, the sound in some point in the anime is really bad, and at some points it's really good. If we take OST's and openings into the account for sound, I say that they add quite a bit to the total experience of One Piece. Characters - 8/10 - I think that the characters were really made up well, and that he added just what it was needed to make them compatible with eachother by making them all share the same horrific past. Some people may think it's a little bit of exaggerating, and I think so too, it isn't very realistic for them all to have traumas from their childhood, or to bear scars, but that's what he did so the characters could've bonded through the anime by experiencing ""hell and heaven"" with eachother. I approve of this in my own way. Enjoyment - 8/10 - I give it a total enjoyment of 8. It is a little bit different from a regular Shounen anime, but what made me give it a 9 is just because I enjoyed watching every second of it so, so, so much, even if it were fillers. It had a lot of emotional scenes aswell that I still like rewatching from time to time. If I was more objective about this, and if I considered other people opinions about this, I would've said it's a 6 or a 5. But I simply don't think that way, and I may have fan-boyed it a bit on the end, but hey, I really liked this anime tho. Overall - 7/10 - I'd give it a total of a 7. It's a very objective view about it, if it was myself I'd give it a 10, but honestly, it doesn't deserve it. If you look through the grades I've been giving all over, it has to be a 7 overall. If you're gonna watch this anime you should be prepared for the bad animations for about 300 first episodes, then it sharpens up a bit i think, and gets at about 720p, but it all comes down the the personal opinions of people, if you like this type of anime I don't think you'll mind the animation much. Also, I forgot to mention, it has quite a few movies(12 or 13, can't remember straight now) and a couple of specials. I think I've written a better review than my last one, and thanks if you read it to the end.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5bd60751f3,7
"Pacing is extremely horrible. Story is extremely amazing. Art is extremely horrible. 1/10 for the the ugliest and most painful pacing in this whole world. Even Dragonball Super had a less painful pacing. The worst thing about this anime is that is gets you hooked on the amazing story and tortures you with the pacing. Since the story is amazing, I guess the manga will be a masterpiece, but in no way does this show deserve anything more than a 1 out of 10. Actually, everyone should completely stop watching this thing so that they stop doing this nonsense, which is to make the pacing extremely slow just so that they won't have to pause the show a little and have the manga get ahead a little and then resume. Heck, I am pretty sure fillers are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more enjoyable than having to watch 20 minutes of an episode with 5 minutes worth of content.",1,Not Recommended,"Sep 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b7b3d73a3,7
"Ok, since there are so many reviews for One Piece, so I'll try not to rehash the usual stuff. This review will more like why you should watch one piece. Story: If there is one word to describe One Piece's story, I'd pick ""GRAND"". 500+ episodes and it's only 1/2 to 2/3 of the way there. The story is about Luffy who wants to be the Pirate King, so he set sail to Raftel which holds the treasure called One Piece. In his journey there, he picked up nakama (comrades) and meet new people along the way. Some of the islands that they stopped by are: Desert kingdom Winter island Prehistoric island Venice style waterworld Sky islands Haunted island Amazon style women only island Fishman island deep under the sea The formula is somewhat standard, where you will discover the past of the island, and Luffy will fight the strongest enemy to help the islands. However, each island's story and characters are unique so it's a new adventure every time they set foot on an island. Mysteries: Besides the main plot, there are also some side mysteries that keep viewers guessing and spawned hundreds of forum posts. Luffy's father, ancient weapons, void century, what is One Piece etc. These are unraveled slowly and tastefully along the way. Characters: This is where One Piece shine the most. The characters are some of the most unique and wacky of all the anime/manga I've watched. You will laugh, cry, and feel for them. The main characters will grow, but their personality is consistent throughout the anime. Some characters who ate the Devil Fruit are given unique abilities. Like Luffy's rubber ability which allow him to stretch his body, or Ace's flame ability to allow him to turn into flame. Final words: If you have not watched One Piece, you might be overwhelmed by the sheer number of episodes. However, it's a blessing that you can watch One Piece non-stop while those who have caught up are waiting agonizingly for 1 episodes per week. Give One Piece a try and you might discover why One Piece is the most popular manga series in Japan.",10,Recommended,"Dec 15, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0c87391584,7
"I know this may sound cliche. But One Piece is the best anime for me. Despite its many flaws, such as graphical inconsistencies, to the very bad pacing. But despite all that, it's really cool that Toei Animation has been able to keep this anime going for over 20 years. I judge an anime by how much I enjoy watching it. And honestly, there are quite a few parts of One Piece that make me feel sleepy, or boring. And that should lower my rating. But because I judge the whole thing, I really enjoyed Luffy's journey to become the pirate king, despite the many flaws and criticisms that can be given, I still think this is the best anime. There is news that this anime will get a remake called ""The One Piece"" and I really hope that it will fix all the mistakes in One Piece. I will lower my rating if the remake succeeds, and becomes better than the original version. I know my review will sound very very biases, and I think you can say that.

"Episode 898 proved it again, this Anime is not worth the time. What happened? It began so strongly, with an anmiation and art-style which needed some time to get used to it but once you did, it suddenly fit. Moreso the story was so rich after a while, you didn't even think about it. But let us get to the present time. The most recent Episode showed perfectly what is wrong with One Piece. It drags too much. It takes up to 5 minutes and sometimes longer with one character building up his technique. To fill more time, the main characters fight side characters who have no purpose in the story than just to get beaten up. But it takes up so much time as if something interesting is happening. You learn nothing new, there is no story progress, but those battles takes 10 minutes and more of the airtime. It is always used for comedic purposes and to show how strong the mc is. We know. We saw it 6000 times already. It doesn't matter if you put cool music under it, even the music starts to become unbearable. The mangaka Oda knows, he draws one or two panels with those and moves on. The worst part are the One Piece apologists. And i don't mean those who truly enjoy the show and defend it, bless them. I mean those who see the problems, are aware of it, they don't like it either but since they protected and defended this show since the beginning against Naruto and Bleach, yes that far back the Big 3 times, it became their second nature. If i didn't invest so much time in this show i would've dropped it. The characters are likeable though some characters now became so one-dimensional, they became boring. I don't see this as much of a problem because i trust Oda to create an arc where they will get a progress. As already stated, the characters, even side characters are the strong point of this show. The story is interesting and is building up since years, though you still can't see where it is going. Enel going to the moon, when everybody thought he is just mad, seems to have a bigger plot role than thought. This is how One Piece catches you. You can engage in many theories and conspiracies. Who doesn't love to do that? I've long decided to read the manga and the only reason i watch the show is because of my little cousin who likes to come over and watch it with me, since i pamper him. He still enjoys it, but he is 8.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 18, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e77e6da7b1,7
"One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful! One Piece is a True Classic.",10,Recommended,"Mar 1, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3ddbcd7748,7

"ok where to start hmmm.... the first anime i saw was naruto and after watching all the eps i thought that naruto was the best anime. But by the time i was watching 1 ep a week i started watching bleach. The same thing happened again because i was watching 1 ep a week of bleach and naruto. So, i then started watching one piece (thank god there was enough episodes to keep me going for a while) and to this day i realised that out of those 3 anime one piece was the best and my favourite. What makes One Piece so great? The storyline is good and keeps you guessing to what ""One Piece"" is but then you realise it doesn't matter because the journey is what matters the most. It has a great balance of happy and sad. There are alot of times where i have shed tears but also times of tears of joy - this rarely happens in other anime. The characters aren't overpowered. This is essential because it adds a sense of realism. Roronoa Zoro is my fave character but he has no devil fruit which makes it more awesome. EPIC. It is the most EPIC anime i have seen so far. Oda (mangaka for one piece) doesn't overuse death to create emotional scenes. I think this is much harder but it makes it feel more authentic and not cheap. Nakama/Friendship. This is probably the best quality of One Piece. Even though Luffy and co are pirates, they will help people because they are good people and value friendship. The Strawhat team pwn. Comedy. Yes there are some funny gags :) What makes One Piece suck? The 4kids dub or whatever. stay away from dubbed and stick to subbed. That's about it i really can't fault anything else.

"First of all, let me start off by saying that One Piece ! is one of my favourite animes and manga of all time, and before you decide to not watch it, read the reviews ! One Piece is by far the most outrageous, amazing, tear jerking, hilarious, life changing animes. It seriously makes me want to drop out of school and become a pirate. If you think that this is extremely shounen and that girls will not like it; you're extremely right for the first bit. I'm a teenage girl, and I swear, I would choose One Piece over every other shojo anime out there. Sometimes shonen animes are the best. [STORY] The story is intriguing from the very start. We see this little skinny kid who looks like nothing special, but then *BAM* he shows you what he can do. If you've read the summary, you'll get the jist, except that the summary leaves out one VERY important detail. DEVIL FRUIT ! These are basically fruit that give the consumer powers, and as you watch the series, you will see the most stupid sounding devil fruit, turning out to be the most powerful creation ever ! The story is funny, but is sserious at times. There are times when I cried my eyes out, and there are times when I died laughing. This anime is non-stop hilarity and can not be described any other way. [ART] The art for the first 200 episodes or so is not the best quality, but is still equally enjoyable. DO NOT COMPARE THE DUB ART TO THE ORIGINAL. It has been modified for children etc. and looks absolutely stupid. Eiichiro Oda's art is often compared to 'Fairy Tail' another shonen anime, but they are both amazing. The design of the characters is both funny and amazing. They are so unique and I know I would never be able to compare them to anything else. [SOUND] please note, this is for the SUB. SONGS are amazing, lyrics are truly heartfelt and funny. They set the story very well using songs and openings etc. Characters voices are magical, whenever I was reading the manga I had a clear idea of what the voices would sound like, and I'm happy to saw my expectations have been met. [CHARACTERS] BEST part of One Piece is how unique and special the characters are. They are not all 'my mother/father died when I was young and now I wander the seas', no, they are all truly heartfelt, sad stories that are only similar in how heart wrenching they are. Every back story, every flash back I had truly felt sad at, and it took an extra 3 episodes to un-break my heart ! [ENJOYMENT] If you haven't read any of my review, here's a basic shortened version of it; BEST. ANIME. EVER. [OVERALL] Simply the best. Couldn't ask for a better anime.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a6c8e75be,8
"One Piece was the second anime show i stared watching(the first one being Death Note) and ever since i started i have been a huge fan of both the storyline and some specific characters. Story: The story of the series unveils around the main protagonist's main ambition to become the King of Pirates, in a world that is ruled by a mysterious government that has five elders at the top. The world of One Piece is unique. It bears no similarity to any other world i've seen in other anime shows, as it is mostly comprised of 5 oceans (along with the Grand Line, in which the treasure is said to be hidden). The man said to have the most freedom in the world is the pirate king because he is not bound by the militaristic government led by the organization of the Marines. And so Luffy sets sail in order to find new nakama for his crew and eventually become the King, with many adventures lying ahead of them. Art-Sound: The animation techniques could be improved but are quite nice nontheless. The OST's released for each season are quite amusing in my opinion and also quite famous in Youtube. Character: Probably the most astonishing domain in One Piece is the variety and complexity of the developed charactes. Since the beginning of the storyline many different and unique characters have been shown making it easy for any person to match themselves with one of them and become obsessed. The protagonist as well as hin nakama illustrate many moral issues and relationships such as friendship, protection of beloved one's, loyalty, trust etc. Also many difficult situations develop such as betrayal. However the combination of different and at all times strong-willed characters makes all of them wasy to like. Enjoyment: In my opinion anyone watching One Piece has a great time enjoying both the battles and the relationships developed between the characters. Many different abilities are shown via the Devil Fruits,which grant each person an ability. One can be eaten by each person. Until now over 100 different devil fruits ave been shown making the battles interesting and mysterious as one is eager to know the other;s fruit abilities and weaknesses. I would give the overall score of 10 to One Piece. It is probably my favourite anime due to its characteristics and the fact that i am obsessed with Luffy. I hope i helped with my review.

"I started it on August 2024 and finally finished it yesterday,as well as caught up to the manga by today.Yeah,I am the type that can't wait.It was a nice experience overall,but initially at the start i thought,can I even watch this? Should I wait for the WIT adaptation? but I am 21 already and WIT will take at the very least full 10-12 years to cover all arcs.By then I'll be a grown up with a family and have a hectic work schedule,so why not try it,I have watched many Isekai garbage,so maybe,at the very least it won't be trash,like I had bare minimum expectations and I always have the bare minimum expectations of anything in life,that is my way of life,cause if you live like this,life can surprise you and for this I must say it did.Now,my first point would be ,I did not expect to sob this much( like,I sobbed for a boat man...), honestly at the start it was unbearable,it seemed good when the story was flowing but the animation was making it hard to keep watching,until Alabasta,after which I became invested in it as more of an adventure story,which it actually is(In an adventure story payoffs come at a slow rate but it hits hard when it does)rather than a typical battle shonen(Payoffs and plot moves fast with new and stronger enemies one after the other)( I know it has those elements and plenty of it,but no battle shonen has ever focused on the small details and thrill and adventure part of the story than One piece has, meeting new people ,going new places and exploring almost different world ,especially after Marineford).So after Alabasta I enjoyed it to the fullest and just enjoyed the journey,I did get burnt out, stopping for a few days and then going cause I understood it's not a binge watching show, it'll take time and so I gave it the time.Now one thing to note is that although the story is grand and the world of One piece ever so vibrant and rich the pacing does get horrible and it's not the creator's fault, it's the company's.Many blame Oda,but he takes time for the plot to move in full motion and while doing so when the manga is animated,it looks like things keep on getting stalled.So as a new One piece fan i would say if you do start this magnificent story give it time,don't watch if you don't feel like watching,and stall it for a few days if you feel like you are getting burnt out,the plot does drag quite a bit.Or,you can wait for the WIT adaptation which will be an epic storytelling with no budget constraints and free flowing pace of the story and start your journey then.Now I won't say those things like this is a Masterpiece,peak or Oda cooks or whatever but I do implore you to join this amazing adventure and a grand story of epic proportions.You won't regret it.❤️❤️",9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c4caa0d28f,8
"One Piece is awesome! One of my most memorable moment was in the early episodes when Luffy got hypnotized and he started yelling in anger, and I thought the voice was so perfect absolutely hilarious. Thats how I got hooked. My main reason why I like One Piece so much is simply because there is so many episodes. Since I was new to One Piece early december of 2007, I did alot of watching in my spare time. It felt great, every episode I would get more attached and I didnt want it to stop. I'm kinda heartbroken having to wait a week for a new episode, since i fell in love watching 20 episodes a day.

It shakes me everytime I watch a new episode. I would be the happiest person ever if I really had a friend like Luffy. I love every little thing about it. I don't want to talk about technical details or music or manga drawings etc. I am just telling you this is a masterpiece!

"Right off the bat One Piece was not a series I was interested in. I found the art really bizarre, the amount of episodes off-setting, the slow pace of the story to deal with, and quite honestly the voice actor for Luffy annoyed the the heck out of me! However, after devoting my time to watching 650+ episodes of this magnificent series, a love I've never had for any other anime series has developed. I have given this series 7/10 even though is it by far one of my favourite series because it is not without its flaws. Story: 8/10 One Piece is by-far one of the most developed story lines I have ever witnessed conveyed through anime. The thing about it that places it above most other series is that we have a plain goal given to us at the beginning of the story that has maintained its focus throughout the entire series so far. It is a very straight-forward series, and the idea of the 'treasure' being at the end of the Grandline makes the whole series flow. What's more is that from this goal, more goals start to string off and in the end we have a story that has created a magical world of adventure. What I like to tell people when I suggest One Piece is to imagine the dream to become the Pirate King a straight line, and from this imagine every side-story (and there's A LOT!) pulling off from this line and developing its own line. It sounds completely confusing, but the story as a whole is fabricated to have a nice and easy-to-follow flow that still has plenty of room for surprise! Only the most thought-out story lines can maintain this flow. Needless to say, the anime is an adaption from the manga and as such it has its flaws. At times important hints given within the manga to help develop the story line go without animation. Which doesn't seem like a big issue, but overall it gravely lacks the mind blowing development to which the manga has. Furthermore, filler episodes tend to be the most bizarre arcs I have ever seen. There has been one or two filler arcs that has fitted completely well into the story and I would've thought they were canon; but in saying this the series also offers the most absurd filler ideas - and this accounts for about 80% of all filler arcs in the series. Some of the filler arcs are extremely painful to watch through. Overall, the general story line of One Piece is extremely thought out and planned, but due to anime adaption it has it flaws and therefore I give the story an 8/10. ART - 6/8 Straight up, one of the reasons why I was hesitant at first to begin One Piece was due to the art style. This is very common among anyone who comes across the series, and while some people might push past it, others may not overcome it, and others will completely avoid the series. I'm very picky when it comes to the art style of a series, and if I don't like it I will lack enjoyment for it as a whole. In saying this, One Piece has been probably one of the only series that I have learnt to love. After avoiding the series for years, I only attempted it out of boredom and even then I wasn't completely thrilled about watching it due to the art style. It's very different from everything else I enjoy, and sort of seemed off-putting. I'm telling you now - at least attempt to watch the series for a good run and see how you adapt to it. Most One Piece fans will tell you they disliked the art style at first also; however it's truly something you grow to love. After 600+ episodes, I couldn't imagine such a series full of adventure with another art style. The art style is what makes One Piece. To make it clear, I am not giving art a 7/10 for the general art style of the series, but rather because of how the series has been animated. Anyone who knows Toei (the animation studio) comes to understand that they tend to cut corners - even for a big time anime like One Piece. The art can be super sloppy, and poorly done to the point that it becomes laughable. Scenes that should have spectacular artwork are not given the detail to really bring out what the scene should encompass. Despite Toei's faults, all in all the series has a unique art style that sets it afar from the rest. Either you'll love it or you hate it - and however that may evolve depends upon the watcher. All I can say in this regard is the art style might surprise you. It did for me. SOUND - 10/10 The sounds and music in One Piece is one of my favourite things about the series. When asked whether someone should watch the anime or read the manga, I tell them they should do both despite the faults of the anime. The reason why is because I feel like the music, voice characters, and so on are so well done in this show that it really adds to the series as a whole for me. I could listen to all the openings in one day. Many of the songs in One Piece brings back memories for me, and a sense of nostalgia. All the songs are enjoyable, and will have you singing out the words in no time. They fit the atmosphere of the series - that being one of adventure and nakamaship. The choice voice actors (namely in regards to the Japanese sub) is extremely well done. Personally for me all the characters fit their voices! One thing One Piece fans love to laugh at is the unique laughs created for each characters - which I will promise you you will probably try it in private yourself! Like I stated before, at the beginning of the series Luffy's voice annoyed me. As I got more into the series, I became attached to it and couldn't enjoy Luffy's voice as anyone else. The voice actors are able to bring out the character's personality through their skills - which is why I tell people that it's worth it to watch the anime. CHARACTER - 9/10 For an expanding world of wonder comes with the challenge of characters. To have such a large set out, to have too few characters introduced would make the series feel empty and not lively enough. To have too many you risk characters who need development to be left under-developed. Unlike many other animes, the layout for One Piece is extremely large - that being basically the WHOLE WORLD. Even so, each character is given the attention and detail it needs. Minor characters are given minor development, and major characters (tend) to be given major development. Overall you can break the characters up in the series into several categories of importance: major, semi-major, minor and background characters. Those who are major being the crew, those being semi-major meaning the reoccurring characters who had the spotlight in a particular arc, minor being characters who were given detail in the slightest, and background characters being just that. It's a large field to cover, so the development has to be precise for it to be effective. Even so, characters are usually given the necessarily development to make you appreciate them. In particular the crew - all with their interesting and differing back stories - have each their own struggles and goals they wish to achieve. For each character it's a long run of endurance and change - and watching the process of each of these lovable characters becoming the people they want to be - whether slowly or quickly - is truly a journey. Despite this, it is wrong to say all characters in the crew are given the rightful amount of development they deserve. Some of the crew mates tend to be given the spotlight more so than others, and as such they are portrayed as lacking in that area. Needless to say, to say these crews aren't developed at all is also wrong. One thing I find admirable about the series is how so many differing and sometimes conflicting personalities are portrayed throughout the series - and how they develop not just individuality but between each other. Nakamaship is greatly emphasized within the series, and you'll be able to see how characters (mainly in the crew) interact with each other and form relationships. As the series progressed I found myself loving particular friendships between particular characters - think Zoro and Sanji, or the coward trio! It is extremely hard for any writer/author/etc to effectively develop characters in these areas, and when it happens recognition deserves to be given. Another cool thing I find interesting about the characters is how they are developed from real-life people. Most characters in One Piece of some importance you will find their roots into bigger inspiration in real life i.e. for example Mihawk from Dracula, or Blackbeard obviously from the legendary pirate Blackbeard. Of course these should be recognized to the manga's author, Oda; however, needless to say I believe the anime has done a great job in adapting them and portraying them how they should be. Thus I have given this area a 9/10. ENJOYMENT - 8/10 My enjoyment for the series tends to be lacking due to one issue: pacing. All the other cons are vastly overcome by the pros; however sometimes the pacing becomes unbearable. Having watched the anime first all the way to episodes 500-600 before I picked up the manga, the pacing never really got to me. It was there, without a doubt, and my first experience with the anime can tell you it took me a year to have the willpower to get past the first 20 episodes. This pacing is only emphasized once you start comparing it with the manga, and it gets to the point where you you may not be able to watch episodes without thinking about how it was paced within the manga - which greatly affected my enjoyment for the series. No doubt One Piece would be a large anime regardless of pacing, but needless to say the ratio of episode to chapter has certainly pushed the limits of episodes. While pacing remains an issue for me, I still believe the pros I have had for the series as a whole have provided me with one of the best anime experiences I have ever had. This series is definitely not without flaws. Some areas lack, but in saying this other areas shine. It's entirely up the individual experience on whether the cons over weigh the pros, or vise via; but personally the pros have given me an entirely fantastic experience that the cons simply can't take away. My enjoyment for this series is undeniable. OVERALL - 7/10 While this rating may not seem good and may reflect that One Piece is not a masterpiece as a whole, please remember I am simply a fan who has taken into account the problems One Piece has. One Piece - regardless of the cons I have reasoned out here - is one of the most memorable series. It is not for everyone, but I emphasize that it is not a series that you should dismiss without trial. The adaption isn't always on point, and things can be done better, but I adore this series and I hate seeing people passing it by due to silly reasons.",7,Recommended,"Feb 4, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3d532f5497,8
"Hello All. Firstly let me say. This review is about the facts of the show. I will try to leave my personal opinon out of it until the end, because for one it's my favorite anime. What I hope this review does is give you some insight about the anime and what to expect. ==Story == Yes im sure youv'e heard of it. Monkey D. Luffy, an ordinary boy who ate a fruit of the ocean (devils fruit) turned into a rubber man. After being saved by his role model who is a pirate, he goes off to be the King of the Pirates. ==Anime Episodes== Firstly, there are three versions of this anime. The first being the Original Japanese version which I highly recommend. The second being the Funimation english dub version, which is the exact translation of the Japanese version. And lastly.. the dreaded 4kids version which should not be watched and burned on sight. (Sorry for that opinon but I think all one piece fans will agree) ==500+ Episodes OMG== Yes the anime is over 500 episodes long. But don't let the number scare you away. One piece tells a story with every single arc. Oda (the Creator) made the show in a way where you get the see what is going through the minds of every main character and enemy before the fight/struggle/adventure takes place. I warn you now. If you are looking for just pure action, READ THE MANGA. The anime stays true to the fights but, its an anime. They can't just catch up on the manga. So what do they do? They extend the fights, and the events before the fights. I think its great, but for some, it may seem as though the anime is dragging on. ==Artwork== Nowadays anime's are coming out in 1080p. One piece is older, so naturally the orignal episodes look older. But rest assured, by the time you get to Enes lobby arc, there will be a huge animation quality upgrade. Not opinion, fact. ==Character Development == Each character develops because they all have thier own personal goals and dreams as they travel with Luffy (or try to capture him). They all mature in thier own way. And when I say everybody I mean EVERYBODY. Again.. 500+ episodes. == Opinion == Watch it. Don't expect it to kick off into a action packed pew pew shoot em up fight until many episodes in. But what got me hooked was seeing his crew get through struggles, fight for their goals and life, seeing them face enemies that are sometimes stronger than thier entire crew put together, or more cunning than them. Seeing how a person who's only abilitly is stretching with some inhuman strength fight enemies made of elements such as smoke for example. Seeing the tears of thier crewmembers as they fight for thier friends. Truly, I found this anime to be moving, funny, and have some insanely INTENSE fights. This is also the first anime where I was rooting for some of the bad guys as well as good guys. I love luffy's crew, but some baddies are just... damn cool (Icy Cool in fact.) ==Closing== If your looking for an anime thats short, to the point, great kickoff, than this is not the anime for you. It's long, but enjoyably so. If DO however have time, patience, and in the mood for a good story with in my opinion GREAT rewards for sticking with it, than this is the anime for you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",10,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b2f3c6812e,8
"Well after watching 500+ episodes and reading the manga I think this is a good stopping point for me to review the masterpiece of an anime-series which is One Piece. At this point it’s kind of cliché to even review this anime due to the massive number of reviews written so far but in reality I feel that one piece STILL does not get the standing ovation it deserves. And maybe the ridiculous and continued FAILED Americanisation attempts of it is to blame……well anywayz it still beats ALL anime-series to date. Animation In its early days it was drawn in a lets say a “misleading” comical sense that can present the series as slapstick, well the animation complements the idea of a simple comedy - which is so far from the whole picture. Intense battle scenes can make you think your watching the most serious and brutal of anime, combined with very distinctive facial expressions of laughter, anger, disgust, misery and every other colour of the rainbow - its actually refreshing to see this basic style of animation depict such a range of emotions. Over the years you can see more detail has been put into the simple animation design without any artistic compromise…a fantastic and unique feat in my humble opinion. *A Special shout out goes to all the Fan-subbing groups for adding fantastic graphical text for character special moves (Kaizoku fansubs, Vegapunk etc)* Sound Well..well Firstly…let’s start by just saying the original Japanese audio is flawless in every way Openings, Closings, Background & all voice actors PERFECT. Secondly & Sadly 4Kids entertainment have forever stained and ruined the one piece experience for countless westerners who sadly watched the horrific English dub and got a totally unreal one piece experience and although Funimation entertainment has taken over and re-dubbed it, its not only too late but still not up to scratch again. This just proves the fact that some anime just cannot be applied correctly to other regions without losing the spirit of the anime! Sorry for the mini-rant but the true one piece fans are just fed up! Japanese audio is perfect and English dub should be avoided like the swine flu! Story Again at first glance One Piece can appear to look like a slapstick pirate comedy but it’s so much more. Every character has a story in one piece and there are probably 100+ stories that could be told but the anime focuses on the ever growing Straw Hat Crew and each character of the crew. These stories usually involve a traumatizing childhood, a pivotal character related death and a goal for that character to achieve (told beautifully I might add). These stories are just brilliant and I must say out of all the long running anime series I’ve seen Dragonball, Pokemon, stupid Naruto and Bleach etc - One Piece just feels like there’s hardly any filler as all the episodes just seem to contribute to the straw hat pirates adventure! With exception to the historical special arcs found more recently which are mildly comical but not like 130 eps (STUPID-ASS NARUTO!!!) ahem. Characters As I said before One Piece has a HUGE number of characters From Crewmates, Marines, Civilians and SUPERVILLANS. Yep One thing One Piece does well is VILLANS these villans are the definition of pirates where killing attacking manipulating and even beating women & children is all fair play. The characters in one piece just tend to bring out the emotions in its audience Luffy will have you laughing and rooting for victory, Nami will have you wondering do all women love money this much and Zoro will have you saying should’nt this sword guy be in samurai champloo? Lol. Enjoyment One piece is easily the anime I have had the most pleasure enjoying in my anime career and I tend to use it as a pick me up emotionally, as most fans will tell you one piece has a very therapeutic quality to it..yep that’s a weird thing to say but if you agree with me chances are you hit the helpful button below this review. If I had anything bad to say about One Piece it is around the 300 Ep point I started to feel that the storyline would go in a repetitive routine that was starting to become a little bit too predictable – and just after I started feeling that way around the 400’s the entire series changes gears and shakes things up big time……so much for predictability! Value In my opinion one piece has something for everyone Action, Adventure, Comedy and trust me even though people don’t mention it this anime can actually bring ya to tears of sadness and most definitely tears of joy. Sadly I’ve noticed the sheer number of episodes steer many newcomers away thinking its too much of a commitment. This is one of the few anime I say makes me proud to be an anime fan its just One in a Million which NEVER fails to entertain! i would just warn people to not be fooled by its slapstick appearance and STAY AWAY FROM ANY AND ALL ENGLISH DUBBED VERSIONS OF ONE PIECE IT’S THE EQUVIALENT TO WATCHING POKEMON…actually that’s insulting Pokemon…sorry Ash!

"So, it's a shounen, a goofy and silly shounen indeed, but I think what it fills even better is being a prime example of what not to be. So the art. It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down. It has now become a running joke amongst my friends, I guess it has that going for it.

"People often profess that this anime is the best they've ever watched, which led me to watch it myself. Big mistake. One Piece is easily the most overhyped anime in all of shonen. Let me explain why. Story (2/10): The story revolves around the most cliche plot in all of anime - Monkey D. Luffy wants to find the One Piece. However, the irony stems from the fact that in all 955 episodes of this show, he still hasn't managed to reach his goal, and continues to steer away from it through filler-like side quests that seem to hold no significance to the overall story. Art (1/10): Do I even need to explain? Every character looks like a stick figure with a stretched-out forehead. Sound (7/10): The sound fits the pirate theme of this show well, with smaller sound effects and music playing through during fight scenes being somewhat enjoyable. There are some times where the sound significantly adds to what is shown on the screen, although it doesn't stand out from other anime in any way. Character (2/10): This show lacks any major character development, especially with the main character, which makes many portions of the story completely pointless. While I haven't progressed far in the series, from the couple dozen episodes I have watched, there seems to be no chance of these characters changing in any way. Not to mention that the art style prevents the characters from displaying any form of emotion, due to their 2-dimensional facial features. Enjoyment (1/10): I think you can see why I gave this category a 1. Overall (1/10): As an anime, One Piece simply does not live up to the standards of the other shonen in its class (Naruto and Bleach), and lends itself to be extremely difficult to watch. I felt the want to drop the show after every episode but only progressed due to the praise of the show from others. Don't let the 8.50 rating fool you like it did me.

"This is my first review ever. :) One Piece is one of the best animes I've ever seen because it includes a great plot, amazingly funny characters(especially the main characters), and it has many episodes. Throughout the anime, Luffy, the main character meets different people who eventually became his crew mates to go on a journey to find a treasure called One Piece, but as you watch more and more, the plot gets more exciting, complicated, and you'll begin to become a bit anxious for the characters because stronger characters, that are stronger than Luffy, will appear.

"I stressed enough as this anime is only ranked 58 on the list(LETS GET ONE PIECE TO THE TOP GUYS) ive either gotten several negative responses when i mention One Piece 1- Its too long 2- (usually mentioned by fan-girls) Death Note FTW!(which i dont think it derserves to have such a high rating) 3- Ewww that anime is ugly 4- naruto/bleach is better 5- Ive seen the dub it sucks bawls Ill try not to write any spoilers and make it brilliant as possible Story 10/10 Luffy a young 17 year old, who has eaten the Gomu Gomu Devil Fruit making him a rubber man, aspires to be the Pirate King, his carefree personality makes him the main character of the story and we follow him and his crew on his path to being the Pirate King, the great arcs one ive loved much was the Enies Lobby arc which was quite amazing Unlike certain Animes which have no ability kill anyone off One Piece has plenty of such things making the Anime an emotional one. I remember when i was 9 the dubbed version by 4kids was absolutely horrid i remembered no blood or anything to being with One piece should get a a different dubbers infact without looking at the art to much or the voice acting i thought the story sounded quite great here i am watching it again 6 years later but this time on the subbed version, please don't watch the dubs, Art 10/10 So what if the art is funny looking it fits like a glove onto the type of this anime one piece is funny its meant to be funny it should be denied because of art style i mean its more then 10 years old as we progress in the story my current time is 2011 the art get clearer Sound 10/10 Every sound and background in one piece as id liked to imagine it fits perfect with the scene or current arc to make a scene sound badass or completely stupid Characters 10/10 every character in One piece has a back story a childhood not one character is left out its deeply thought about and very deep, in most flashbacks which every different character usually has all the stories connect, every backstory ive seen so far is very touching and emotional thus making make score a 10/10 Enjoyment 10/10 Every battle scene in One Piece is Badass they always somehow try to beat there opponent no matter what its a common theme but no matter how much stronger the opponent they always have a resolve. Overall 10/10 overall this Anime is really great i recommend it MAKE ITS NUMBER ONE ON RANK GUYS its really tempting i watch the entire series well i caught up to it in under a month.

"One Piece isn’t just an anime—it’s a complete experience. Among long-running series, it stands head and shoulders above the rest. While many shows lose momentum or direction over time, One Piece somehow keeps getting better, arc after arc. The story is incredible. What starts as a simple pirate adventure turns into one of the most complex, emotional, and well-crafted narratives in anime history. With over 1000 episodes, the plot never loses its core theme: freedom, dreams, and loyalty. Every arc feels meaningful, and everything connects in the bigger picture. I'd give the story a 9/10, only because the pacing can feel slow at times, especially in the anime adaptation—but the payoff is always worth it. Where One Piece truly shines is in character development. Every main Straw Hat gets their moment, their backstory, and their growth. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Robin—each one has depth and personal struggles that shape who they are. Even side characters get love. It’s no exaggeration to say this anime has some of the best character buildup ever written in anime. 10/10 for that alone. The animation, especially in recent arcs like Wano, is top-tier. Toei really stepped up their game, and the fluid fight scenes, color palette, and visual storytelling have reached a whole new level. Some older episodes may not hold up visually, but the newer content more than makes up for it. 9/10 overall. One Piece also blends every genre imaginable—action, adventure, comedy, drama, mystery, thriller, even a bit of horror and romance. It has emotional climaxes, epic battles, unforgettable music, and some of the most iconic moments in anime history. Whether you're here for the journey, the characters, the fights, or the world-building, One Piece delivers. It’s not just worth watching—it’s worth living through.

"To say I was reluctant at first to watch this show at first, was an understatement. I have only been watching anime a couple years now and didn’t know too much regarding this show. I had just finished all 720 episodes of Naruto, which I think is indeed inferior to this show but I still love it so and wanted to casually watch some smaller 12 episode anime. One of my closest friends had been going bonkers about this show and I decided to pick it up, against my original plan. What followed is possibly the greatest Shonen Jump show I have ever seen. The characters are incredibly fleshed out with rich, deep and compelling backstories, each fight against small pirate crew, big crew, marine, Yonko, etc matters to the overarching narrative, every arc feels like an interactive adventure and it’s beautifully portrayed with Toei's animation. The Summit War, Water Seven, Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island arcs are arguably some of the best in Shonen anime history. Currently at Whole Cake Island but my god, I cannot recommend this show enough, the time you invest in is absolutely repaid 100s of times over. No show continues to grow like this one and some day it’ll eventually come to a close as one of, if not the greatest Shonen stories ever told. :)",10,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2f8184f5ba,8
"""I don't want to rule anything. Being King of the Pirates is about being more free than anyone."" - Luffy. Genuinely a heart of gold. A masterpiece. Simply a 10/10. Is it too long for you to watch? Don’t worry about that—just watch the first two arcs and you’ll soon be saying, “How dumb I was to sleep on something so beautiful.” I really don’t want to overhype it, but the truth is this is a slow-pacing story that requires time to fully appreciate. My recommendation, based on my own experience, is to watch the episodes at your own pace. As for the story, the characters, the world, the crew—everything? One word: ""fictional peak.""

"One Piece is a masterpiece for me personally because I watch it twice from start to end. I have no regrets watching it twice, where it was full of emotions and it taught me a lot of things about life. There are a lot of episodes, but all of them are worth watching, so don't be scared to start right now. I can see that people will say that it has so many episodes that it feels like it is not worth it, but it has a lot of action where there are cool moments, funny moments, and so much more that I cannot put into words what I am saying. In my opinion, this anime might be number 1 because of all the cool things that each episode gives you. In this anime, it has everything: Do you want to see action, drama, and ecchi moments? This anime gives you that. There are episodes that made me cry for scenes it gives, and I never thought that literally I would cry about watching anime episodes. It earns 10/10 because it offers you everything that it has, and I know that giving it 10/10 seems like me not taking it seriously, but since one piece is only anime, I will say it earns it. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Oct 15, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5c4f6c9834,8
"Overall rating: 6/10 Oh my goodness gracious please read the manga. I love One Piece so much, I believe it has some of the best storytelling ever. But the anime has just so many drawbacks for me. It's not like I hate the anime, there are some things that are great about it, like the voice actors and the suspenseful music. But the pacing. I seriously cannot gripe about anything else but the pacing. It is truly atrocious. It took me a good 2-3 months after watching the first 150 episodes to try and watch anime again. But when I finally did, I was in utter shock at how entertaining a show can be when it has even semi-decent pacing. After finishing the manga, I went back and tried to watch the Dressrosa arc in the anime, since I had been told by a few people, that it has some of, if not, the best pacing in the series, and it was still terrible. I do understand that building suspense can impact certain scenes a lot, and I also think that it can be amazing in the right moment, but it reached a point for me where I was wasn't sitting there in suspense, just itching to see what happens, I was bored, because it was taking so dang long for something to happen. To anyone who is considering getting into One Piece, I personally, would strongly urge you to read the manga instead. If you've never read manga before, I think this could be a decent choice to make your first too. I would also like to note, that reading the manga is way more time efficient. I am a college student and I can definitely take a 10-15 minute break and read a couple chapters, but a single episode will take 20 minutes and most of the time that episode only covered half of a single chapter. Once again, this is my opinion, maybe you would enjoy One Piece's pacing, but I sure as hell didn't.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 28, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_153d441749,9
"After considering other anime as my favorite I've decided one thing ""one piece"". Unlike other animes, you can just watch one piece and it won't stop! A big pro about this anime is it's length. As long as you have the time, you can watch a lot of it without worrying that it'll end soon. Another great thing is the storyline. There isn't one big storyline like other animes, this comes with arcs, an island with it's History and story, with the little storyline of what happends in the world of one piece. I've said to myself ""Okay I'm gonna watch this island again for sure!"" But after seeing the next one which is better ""No way! This is even better!"" And this is how it goes. The soundtrack- an awesome one, many themes for many situations. One piece started about 15 years ago, when the art was pretty ""bad"" but as the episodes pass the art is getting better. For those who watched Naruto and those with fillers, One Piece doesn't have many fillers and most of it are flashbacks. Movies! I've seen some of the sidestory movies which were good as well, like the real One Piece.

"Main review and then recommendations for anyone looking to get into the series after (from someone who isn't a One Piece stan or a One Piece hater). I watched the main arcs via One Pace (like all new OP fans should), but have seen the pacing of the show in normal episodes as well. There is egregious padding to start and end nearly every episode (thus each episode is really only 10-12 min of new content) and there are several filler arcs that are unwatchable nonsense. As others have pointed out, the strengths of this show are countered by the abysmal pacing. Even though there are around 1,000 episodes out, if compressed and reedited to be reasonable, there would only be around 700, if not fewer. However, disregarding the unreasonable pace, it's clear why this show has so much of a following. The world is expansive, embraces different ideas of freedom, provides an imaginative structure of power (both the character power system of devil fruits/Haki and the world power subdivisions like World Government, Pirate Emperors, the Revolution Army), and is overall a strong mixture of light adventure and the brutalities of pirate life. If you're lucky to get into OP now, you don't have to wait and can breeze through strong arcs like Alabasta, Sky Island, Water 7, Marineford, and Impel Down. The current arc, Wano, is very strong as well, though incomplete. However, you'd be more lucky to get into this show in 10 years, since I can only imagine that's how long it'll take for Oda, the creator, to finish. As far as characters go, Luffy is a strong shonen protagonist, if not a typical one. Hopelessly daft, impetuous, strong, moral, compassionate, gluttonous- he shares perhaps one too many traits with Goku. The crew members are mostly fine but some have gags that have and will never be funny but which persist for some reason (Brook asking every girl if he can see their panties, and his ""I don't have x body part since I'm a skeleton"" thing). Nami, Zoro, and the newest crew member (as of Wano) are clearly the best, while Sanji and Chopper are the worst. Chopper is just there to sell merchandise. More on Sanji below. Villain quality drastically varies, from Crocodile, Enel, and Blackbeard at the stronger end, with Hody and Gecko Moria at the weaker end. The cast of characters OP has is impressive, even if some come up short. The world's scale is perhaps the best in anime. Female characters and how the male characters interact with them, however, is where the show is at its worst. Oda takes the grotesque and insidious body image standards of supermodels and goes even further with his female characters. Big boobs and waists thinner than their heads. Within the show itself, these characters are largely the object of a gross voyeuristic look, with Sanji and myriad other characters repeating the insufferable nosebleed horniness that should be totally removed from all anime. Sanji is easily the most cringe character in this show. Next, the plotting of the arcs can be repetitious and formulaic. Many major arcs involve this plot progression: arrival at a new place, the crew splitting up for some unnecessary reason, chance encounters by the crew build out the world (often where canon arc filler comes in), Luffy meets the most influential character in that place - typically a princess - by saving them from danger and thus accrues good will, Luffy and other major characters get captured, some previously befriended support character saves them, we learn Luffy's befriended character is extremely important to the history of the place, they escape from captivity after the main antagonist spills their plan like Dr. Evil, the crew reunites and hatches a plan, that plan fails but things fall in place anyway, Luffy screams the antagonist's name and stands up against injustice of that place, the characters match up with enemies of their skill level while defeating hundreds of grunts, Luffy battles main antagonist, the friends made along the way help Luffy and co. leave the place and/or protect them from capture. The arcs that don't follow this formula are generally the best plot-wise: Impel Down, Marineford, Water 7/Enies Lobby, Wano. Sound and Art: fine to good. Some episodes where the animators are padding includes horrible slideshow animation that tracks over static shots for like 10 seconds each. In addition, they give reaction shots to every single character present in order to give the appearance of actually animating when in reality it's just a sequence of still shots. The worst of this was in Fishman Island, probably the worst arc of the series. In the climactic moments of the series, including major battles, the animation is good to great. I don't pay as much attention to music as some on here, but the climactic moments do unfold to a strong score. Recommendations: While this will be blasphemy to the One Piece stans, I think a good portion of One Piece can be skipped. I would highly recommend checking out the many filler guides for OP online. I would not watch a single filler/anime-only episode; the only content worth watching is canon manga material. As a result, I would highly recommend watching One Pace, which reedits to agree with the manga- it's incomplete but still very helpful. For instance, Fishman Island ran 62 episodes while the One Piece reedit puts it at 24, with some episodes going around 30 min. Next, the Long Ring Long Land Arc, regardless of what anyone says, is filler and can be skipped in its entirety. I would also suggest watching all of Fishman Island at 1.5 speed and skipping any scene Hody, the main antagonist, is in. Lore is the only thing that matters in this arc, and everything that isn't teaching us about the ancient world is extremely boring. Besides these two warnings, every other major arc is important enough to watch (via One Pace). Finally, the level of enjoyment really depends on how much the filler and padding affects the experience, as well the arc in question. Like I said, I didn't have to contend with the insufferable pacing as much as others have and so enjoyed it more than most would if they watched all ~1,000 episodes without skipping. I really enjoyed the arcs previously mentioned, and was bored by a few. If I had to pick the most enjoyable arcs that I think represent the spirit of OP and validate its popularity, I would go with Sky Island, Water 7, and Dressrosa. I understand why OP gets both so much praise and why it should get even more criticism than it does. At its core, it is one of the strongest shonens but its strengths lead people to think it's perfect. It's not one of the best anime ever, but it's very entertaining when it's sticking to the main events, lore, and world building.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 11, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7f7151bedd,9
"One Piece is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. it is without doubt my favorite anime/manga. It has amazingly interesting and cool characters and a seemingly simple but grand plot. One of the things that I love about it are the characters. Some are just quirky but many others are very well written and interesting. One Piece has an extensive variety of good characters that just make the whole One Piece universe even better than it already is. I could go for hours thinking about different battles that could have happened in different arcs between different characters that would have completely changed the series. My favorite character is Doflamingo and he is really cool because he is crazy and he just doesn't care about anything but his goals which is really awesome. Another great thing about One Piece is the artwork. I like the artwork because it is a very good at most parts. The first 500 episodes have good art but after that it gets kinda messed so I would recommend reading the manga after that point. Another great aspect of One Piece is its music. When something is going down with Luffy a really epic song will play and it will get you really hyped for the coming battle. Just thinking about these songs gives me chills because of what was going on when they were playing. It also has very good openings and endings that are amongst the best I've heard. One Piece's story is seemingly simple: Luffy is searching for the One Piece. It is not as simple as it seems though. Each arc has its own unique theme, appeal, and characters. each arc immerses you into that islands world and keeps you very entertained. Also each arc builds up on the last one to make a very grand story. With all these things combined it makes One Piece have something special that I have yet to see in anything else anime, TV series, and movies.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_066016be22,9
"At the risk of losing all my readers, let's start with some math. Four hundred and fifty episodes, roughly thirty minutes each, comes out to 13,500 minutes, with some generous rounding. There are 1,440 minutes in a day, meaning that would take over nine days to catch up to the latest episode of One Piece if you start from episode one and never sleep. It takes some extreme dedication to get that far; such dedication that, in fact, it should pointless to ask me what I thought of the series. The numbers can't lie: I loved it. I have dedicated half a year of my free time between work and High School to this anime, and it was consistently one of the highlights of my week. I don't think you should just go watch One Piece; I think you should go watch One Piece right now. I have joined a large chorus of fans and writers online who will all tell you with the zeal of a cultist that this series is awesome. This is the creme de la creme of shounen series, it has reached the zenith of what anime can do several times over, if you even think you can make the time to see this, you must at least try. And our voices are so loud and so strong... ... that a perfectly natural reaction from someone who hasn't seen this series, or has seen some of it and didn't care to continue, is skepticism. After all, I'm talking about a cartoon about a rubber pirate who acts like he's five years old. It's essentially just another shounen fighting series for 11-year-olds; it hardly seems like the Citizen Kane of anime. Hyperbole in the name of exuberance can have the odd effect of putting people off, and spending over hundred hours on anything requires a lot of exuberance. That skepticism is understandable, especially since explaining what makes this series work might not sound all that different from why people enjoy Bleach, Naruto, or similar series. So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. Take the superpowers our heroes wield. Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, these characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. The concept of One Piece is very open ended; ""Boy tries to be the Pirate King"" leaves a lot of room open for how that could happen. Appropriately enough for a series about a long odyssey, the series has been leisurely working its way towards an ending. So far, the anime has covered about five major story arcs, some of which have several mini arcs. It starts out with short, mostly silly stories that are quickly resolved, but as we get to know the characters more and the world opens up, it gradually, confidently builds towards high drama with some epic storylines. Two examples stand out: the Alabasta Arc and the CP9 Saga. The Alabasta Arc starts shortly after the core of the crew is assembled and spans over fifty episodes. It's a big, meaty storyline with conspiracies and secret identities, rebellions and politicking, and has one of the most effective villains I've ever seen in anime. It's only topped many episodes later, with the epic CP9 Saga. This one spans a hundred episodes and is a more emotional viewing, and it's where the Straw Hats show the most growth. I really mean it when I say One Piece has the elusive ""spirit of anime."" As a series, the serialized storytelling has a lot of impact that builds from episode to episode, and shows extensive planning for arcs a couple hundred episodes in advance. It's one of the few series that can only be realized in animated form, and it has so much impact because of its extreme length. And it may be nowhere near finished. When recently asked how close the manga was towards completion, which the anime sticks very close to, Oda estimated that he was about halfway finished. And while he's known to be a jokester in interviews, I don't know of any reason not to take his answer at face value.

"Before I start reviewing this series , I would like to just say one thing. The anime does the manga LITTLE TO NO justice. In this review , I would be comparing the anime to its manga counterpart. How should I put it ? The closest words that I can find to describe this anime is probably , horribly-paced. Disclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means. Story : 7/10 In regards to the storyline , I'm generally okay with it as unlike the other two popular shounen series like Bleach and Naruto , One Piece has little fillers (don't even get me started on Naruto please). And the anime follows the manga almost strictly in terms of storyline. I would have given it a higher mark if not for the animators screwing up the Hody VS Luffy fight. It made Luffy look superbly WEAK. Art : 2/10 One Piece is generally infamous for it's simplicity in its drawing and many people simply cannot get used to this , often irked by it compared to other animes/manga with great character designs and such. However , since the anime follows the manga , I will not fault the anime for this. However, what's really nerve-wrecking is that the animation and drawing is shit. Pardon me but yes. Just one look at the Sabaody Archipelago arc almost gave me cancer literally. I guess that's what happens when all the senior animators are dispatched to work on the movie and the juniors are free to do with the anime. I could still list a bunch of arcs with simply horrible animations that looked as though the animators wanted to be just be done with it and that's all. (Fishman arc for example ; biggest let down of 2013 after all the finishers looked like shit) Other than that, hardly any animation in this series is worth-noticing. Sound : 6/10 The soundtracks are generic and the only ones that really stands out from the rest is probably The Very Very Very Strongest and Luffy's Fierce Attack and maybe Giant Stronghold Takeoff. But just these three tracks itself is not able to carry such a long anime and it gets seriously repetitive after awhile. As for the openings and endings, sorry to say but I'm not a fan of any except for Share The World. I would have given it somewhere along 3/10 if not for the voice actors. The voice actors themselves. All I can say is , hats off to them. Let's start with the notable mentions. Luffy - Godlike contagious laughter and epic speech (very very very rarely). Job well done for voicing the goofy Luffy and I wouldn't be able to find anyone else that could possibly do a better job than Mayumi Tanaka. All I hope is that the voice actor lives to voice the remaining of the series (not cursing but she's getting old and the series still have a long way to go) Zoro - Needless to say , epic speech , epic speech everywhere. There's something about his voice that makes almost everything he says so much more epic than any other character would. "" I got on the wrong ship. -_+ "". Probably the only character that can make something that silly sound cool. Legit. Usopp/Sogeking - Do I even have to elaborate? This guy is freaking hilarious along with a contagious laughter and his awful screaming. And oh , the most memorable scene ? Arabasta and Enies Lobby speech about Luffy. Nuff said. Sogekinguuuu!! Chopper - This is a honourable mention because I cried at his past. No joke and his voice actor who happens to be the same seiyuu for pikachu did an extraordinary job voicing him especially during drum island. You could feel the sheer emotions coming out from her voice when Chopper starts to cry. Brook - YOHOHOHOHOHOHO! The rest of the characters were pretty average or nothing note-worthy. (Buggy is an exception to this though). This is the reason why the sound gets a 6/10 instead of a 3/10. Character : 8/10 Like the manga series, each character are given a single arc to tell their past and such. After that , each character slowly gets developed and there are evident character development. One notable example would be Zoro who told Luffy when they first met that if Luffy were to do anything to hinder him from becoming the world's strongest swordsman , he would kill him. However as time passed , Zoro began to respect Luffy as the captain and would even lay down his life for him if needed (when against Kuma). Each character is also diverse and unlike other anime series that have a huge cast , all the characters are not just a vase as they contribute to the series greatly as well instead of just giving one liners just to show their 'presence'. Enjoyment : 3/10 The enjoyment of this anime , sadly to say , does not live up to the story and character because of the crappy art that really put me off. But that's not the worst thing , it's the pacing that killed this anime. Toei strictly abided by it's ground rule that an One Piece episode must follow exactly one manga chapter which probably caused this downfall of a great series. Although the manga is well-paced, with the author taking seldom breaks because of his family and health issues, the anime did no justice to it because of the ridiculously slow pacing. And because of the pacing , the Whitebeard war that was absolutely amazing in the manga turned out like shit in the anime. The art was pretty decent there but the pacing.. oh god. I think I heard Luffy screaming Ace's name for over thirty episodes and a part of me simply just died. If only if the anime could pick up the pacing and do probably something like 1.5chapters/episode, or maybe improve on it by adding additional dialogues for each character which I definitely would not mind instead of showing characters running around doing nothing or FLASHBACKS. That would be great. Don't get me started on the censorship please. Overall : 3/10 It's a shame that I would have to give this great series such a low grade but as things stand. It's not worthy of any higher marks in my personal opinion. Unless the anime can do something about the horrible pacing , this is the final score I would give this series. And yes, I'm heavily biased against the anime because it simply does not live up to the manga like most animes. For those that have not check the manga out , do it and you would probably find better enjoyment than wasting twenty minutes each week just staring at characters running about doing literally nothing and the plot progress like a snail.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 24, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a83f26aad5,9

Not just the characters are the one whose improving, even the drawings that put here were improving to. from plan 2d to amazing anime. So I rate this anime perfect.

"This is a new review; I found out after watching 29 episodes of One Piece, I realized I made the original review too early. Okay first off; Story: The story of One Piece is so much different to everything else I've watched, I like One Piece and gave the story an 8 because it's something I myself haven't seen something as planned out and consistent as this, although it has major flaws, for example the fillers... I'm kind of happy I haven't waited week-by-week to watch the 319 episodes I have currently watched, I would of been disappointed to of been given 3 months worth of filler... Although; some of the filler episodes are very interesting and actually make you want to watch them, namely during the Enies Lobby Arc, I will not mention anything that can be classed as spoilers so I'll leave the story section of this review here. The art, On my first review I found the art to be very poor; not realizing that One Piece was released in 1999(The Anime) so I gave this a very low rating the first time, but as I have gotten further on with the story I have noticed many changes to the art and fighting styles all of the characters use and how much it has improved, and I'm not even up-to-date with One Piece, I literally can't wait to see the complete development of this series, although waiting every week for this show will be a killer.I rated the new art style an 8. The sound; I found the opening theme tunes well fitted for this series and a lot of work was put in, Usopp's songs and so-on so forth. The Opening theme tune is very catchy for every arc and makes you enjoy watching them from start to finish, it kinda makes you feel like watching more and more every time you hear it. The sound was rated an 8. Well, not on to the second most vital point of any anime I watch and write my reviews on... The Characters, I find the character development for One Piece amazing, you learn about every one of Luffy's Nakama's past and how they ended up where and how they are, wanting to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to do so, and with Luffy as the captain, who says that's impossible?! This section I rated 9, as I have thoroughly enjoyed watching every character develop and seeing what they turn out like and how they can overcome the impossible on a daily basis. It's finally time, this is the most vital point in any type of anime you can watch - Enjoyment, with this whole series, the first 50 or so episodes, I thought about stopping; reaching a certain landmark and just carrying on when I can be bothered, I'm glad I didn't do that. This has instantly become a favorite of mine, making me WANT to watch more and I just enjoy watching almost every episode, I rated the enjoyment factor for One Piece a 9. Overall: 9 I have given the overall summary of One Piece a 9 in my opinion, it's so amazing that I didn't think I would like this show; I took it on with a whim and I don't regret that one bit, One Piece teaches you so many life rules, abiding by your own justice and doing what you feel is right and not what the world thinks of it, if you think it's right, go at it whole-heartedly and you won't be disappointed with yourself, Luffy believes in his friends and Nakama to the bitter end knowing they are capable of overcoming everything and I find that the deepest bond between them all, it just sets everything in motion. I have enjoyed re-writing this review; I will leave my old review below for comparison for people wishing to judge One Piece too early, like what I done. -This review was wrote on Nov 7th 2013- ""With this show, I've found that the art-work isn't as what I personally expected, I find that other long running shows have much better artwork, for example Bleach, or Naruto... Although I've only just started to watch this series, I can't see the artwork changing too much. I find that the story plot is quite impressive, looking for the most valuable treasure in the land on a huge journey, gathering members, and as of what I've watched, it's a decent pace for a long running, as it has been going since 1999, which is impressive in itself, 14 years?! That is a a standard in itself. I found the characters very interesting, like I said, I'm a new watcher so getting to know the characters very early is a good thing, the way Luffy obtained his most precious treasure and Zoro started to learn his three sword technique and their goals. I found that to catch my attention, and a lot of thought was put into these episodes explaining their pasts. I used to dislike the thought of watching One Piece, but I have eagerly changed my mind, last year I watched 3 episodes, got bored and switched it off, I have came back (Was looking for some new stuff to watch) and I don't regret it, I have enjoyed this show - Only on episode 29, but started 3 days ago(4th Nov 2013). I have rated the show an overall 9. I am enjoying it, but the thing I am most let down by is the art work, I understand that for a 1999 production, this is probably a lot more advanced, and brings me back to the times I watched Tenchi Kyo-Ryo-Ohki or, a personal favorite of mine; Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, they were, and still are excellent shows, even with their artwork, and I hope this turns out to be the same. Thank you for reading, I hope this is helpful to anyone looking to watch this anime.""",9,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_73160475ab,9
"Brief overview: It's worth watching, but it requires a lot of patience due to the massive amount of episode Story 9/10 The story has a lot of emotional, funny, and epic moments, but it suffers a similar issue to most long-running shonen series where most of the content is focused on fighting and the one that is outside of fighting the content is generally quite good. So the story sets in a world of pirates, there was once a pirate called Roger who claimed the greatest treasure ever known as one piece ever since then he is known as the Pirate King. One day the main character decides to set out for an adventure to gather a pirate crew and find the legendary treasure one piece. Characters 8/10 The characters in the one piece universe is great and colorful characters. They are shown very different compare to most anime and most of them have a different and unique personality/ However, there is a problem, most character design looks weird and are extremely tall for some strange reasons/ They are not bad characters, but are strangely designed in some way. Animation 5/10 At times the animation is good or perhaps one of the best in the anime industry, but there is so many times where the anime looks from bad to worse. So it's a very coin-flipping experience as the animation can look bad yet good at the same time because the anime has been handed down from different animators which some of them can not keep up with the consistency of the anime. Sound 4/10 I normally don't add sound into anime reviews, but seriously the sound of this anime is bad. This is because ok at first if you listen to it is not that bad and kinda standard, but they have been using the same sound effect for 10 years straight now and it gets to the point that is tedious and annoying. Like punching, sword slash and jumping it is so tedious to hear the same sound over and over again. For fuck sake add new sound effect even the long Hiatus Bleach don't have this much copy and paste sound. TLDR Overall is worth watching, but it takes a lot of patience because the story is so long and it takes many episode to fully understand one segment of the story. The characters are lovable and cheerful, but has a strange design towards it and the animation is a coin-flipping quality as some looks good yet some looks bad. The sounds does hugely impact the anime because they have been using the same sound over and over again which it gets very tedious to watch.",8,Recommended,"Aug 30, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2800ee7ec3,9

"Sit comfortably in your chair and enjoy this excellent review :) FOR EVERYONE WHO HAVENT STARTED ONE PIECE YET, PLEASE DON'T TORMENT YOURSELF. One piece is not worth watching from my point of view. I utterly despise this anime for its lack of everything except the plot. Let's start with the arguments proving that one piece is not worth watching. First and foremost for majority of the people it is awfully long, the pacing is tedious and revolting. Frankly speaking instead of 1065 episodes it could fit into 700episodes. Let's move into the characters, there is paltry amount of them who are not cheesy and you can even like them (for example zoro or law), nevertheless the rest is as exasperating as hearing gomu gomu no every 15 seconds in literally every fight. The most prominent and extraordinary villain is Big Mom, which is patricularly appalling. Next thing that is objectively repugnant is character design. It is by far the least pleasing feature of One piece. Some characters are designed pretty good (for example zoro, kaido or katakuri) but unfortunately the vast majority is build extremely atrocious. Btw, I dont know how exactly aging works in One piece world because it is interesting that people throughout decades literally change their entire anatomy and grow for example massive heads or shrink from 7metres tall to 1.5metres with distorted bodies. The show is utterly repetetive, 9 out of 10 arcs are designed is 1:1 way, arriving at certain island, at first having fun then finding out about the horrific history of the island and then rescuing the island from bad people. Obviously this anime has plot armor and the actions of Luffy lead to basically no consequences whatsoever. The fights are mid as the can be except the most recent ones where the animation is really pleasant and alluring. Ultimately there is only thing worth praising and it is plot. The plot is amazing, as biased against one piece I can be I resolutely find the plot as complex and entertaining. If only the pacing wasn't as horrendous as it is I could even think about increasing the rating from 3 to 6 but apparently it won't happen. If you made it to the end of this boundlessly stern review and still think that you want to watch One piece then congratulations, you are like me who gave One piece a chance and ultimately rated it as a below average show :)",3,Not Recommended,"Jun 20, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9ae060c9db,9
"ONE PIECE !! Words cannot describe how much this has affected me and how much I love it. I am editing this review because I feel like I haven't wrote even NEARLY enough for my personal favorite anime. If you think I didn't watch enough animes to make that statement well no. I have watched quite a lot. I hope this review encourages you to watch it. And for anyone who thinks it's childish I can just give you one Youtube video that will clear it all up. It's called 'One Piece in 10 minutes' and its my favorite Youtube video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMa3868D41k The story and plot start off basic (just a guy becoming the best of the kind aka pirate king) you can't deny that but as it builds up it's really one of the most fascinating, epic, interesting, creative things i've ever seen so a 10 there. Music wise I STRONGLY believe it has the best music along with Naruto (both) closely beating Pokemon, Fairy Tail and Bleach's music. Openings and endings (it stops having them after a while) are perfect. So definite 10 there.And if you don't think so then here another Youtube video.This one 'One piece best osts' and it has all the best one piece osts- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5-FuoN7YY Art is SUPERB. Every island the strawhats visit are SO unique and fun. There's a lot of fun gadgets,weapons, devil fruits and such getting revealed here and there which just adds to the thrilling and pleasureful art. The animation I can't say much about since it's different each arc. My favorite animation though is the animation in Sabaody arc and East Blue Saga (a lot of people hate its animation but I LOVE it. It's very nostalgic). Then there's the extra stuff in the art (I can name a lot) but one example of what i'm talking about- a river with bunny shapes ! Some of the character designs are weird (Hachi, Bon-clay) but still it's unique while some have such awesome (again unique) character designs (Kuma, Moria, 3 Admirals, Doflamingo). The characters are some of the best i've seen as well. The main characters are Luffy (the MAIN main character you can say) and his pirate crew (who look NOTHING like the stereotypical pirates). They all have such emotional and heart-wrenching flashbacks that you pretty much INSTANTLY start to appreciate them. I myself love the heck out of all the strawhats but you 'might' not think the same. 10 character wise. But the main characters are DEFINITELY not the only reason Now some extra reasons as to why it's so awesome. There are SO many epic moments that will leave you with epic-gasms the size of Russia, SO many sad moments that will leave you crying your eyeballs off and SO many heart-warming moments which feels like your heart is being warmed up in a sauna and being massaged 24/7. I can keep babbling about them but even when i'm done I would NOT have covered even 1/3 the 'scenes' that make One Piece so amazing. Not to mention the powers are freaking awesome.The concept of obtaining the power are devil fruits. It's kind of stupid I know, getting powers from eating a fruit but you get used to it. The devil fruit gives you a wide range of powers.From being able to create nets to turning into leopards to turning into someone who can create earthquakes an cause cracks in the air. There's just TOO many!! Plus it has my favorite power of all time - rubber (yes Luffy's devil fruit power). And there are other unique powers too. SMOKE is one. It's only missing romance. But that's not important partly because we have Sanji. So that's not a flaw AT ALL in my book. So yeah for now I can't think of any flaws with this anime other than say the length and filler which aren't that big to me (I will soon mention why). Now I will counter the flaws people say it has- The animation for the beginning is bad. NO it's not. that was made somewhere near the 2000s so OBVIOUSLY the animation back then is not going to be very good. But it has the best animation for back then(my opinion). Too many FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. One Piece actually has some really awesome fillers though (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of One Piece fillers' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. Too long. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 3 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). An whenever I wasn't busy I marathoned it. An plus I myself like it long. If something's good then wouldn't you want more of it? If you are not giving it a chance or have watched like 2 episodes and don't like it then watch these episodes- 1-3 (they are not that good but it's just for an introduction to the show), 4, 24, 26, 35 and 36. Then resume from episode 5 once you know you will love the series. This is the longest review I did but its worth it getting my opinion across about what I believe to be the greatest 'thing' ever. I have more reasons for giving it a 10 but you might not and probably won't relate to them. there may be some reasons here you might disagree with me for but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this 10/10. So keep watching it cause 'it be one of the most fuscinaten things you'll eva see in the deep blue of the sea'. And maybe you'll even think it to be 'the greatest and most fun adventure of your life', just like I do.

"Without going into spoilers too much I will give my review of One Piece. Characters and Story The story revolves around the main protagonist Monkey D Luffy who aims to become the king of the pirates. And along with him will be the other Straw Hat members who you will meet as you go along the series. The main cast for One Piece is pretty good as they have unique personalities from each other as well as their own fighting styles, powers and abilities. They also got some good backstories which can make you feel and care about them. What they do lack however is development because Luffy does not really have any throughout the series even though he does have a very likable personality and the others only seem have quite a bit of development within the arcs they are introduced in. The side characters you meet within the arcs are good as they may have some good backstories and do develop. The villains are not bad either since they can have an interesting personality and backstory however they kinda lack something which makes you believe whether they actually pose as a real threat to the straw hats and I should state that there isn't a lot of deaths in One Piece which lowers the sense of danger a bit. As for the story it does really well as it has a deep story with many subplots to them which relates to the world building which is also great that comes from within the arcs with the islands they explore as they also go into some themes. Plus there are not a lot of plot holes or inconsistencies so it is well written for the most part. Now if I were to belittle One Piece's story I could say that there is this plot formula which goes like this ""Luffy and crew goes to island, they become friends with a few residents there, have a decent understanding of what goes on within the island, villain starts wreaking havoc, Luffy and crew beat the villain and happy ending, then they go to a new island, rinse and repeat"". However that does not change the fact that One Piece has a great plot. Also I should mention that One Piece does have slow pacing so within the grand scheme of things, there might not be that much progression as the anime usually does 1 chapter per episode and it is apparently halfway through the story although I believe its more 2/3. Action One Piece has some pretty nice fights and the better ones usually come from Luffy, Zoro and Sanji. The animation usually moves fines for it and has some good sound effects for it. Also there is a huge variety of abilities within One Piece and they can get pretty creative with the devil fruits, haki and other techniques as well as some fighting styles. I wouldn't say they have the best fights in anime but that's all subjective and go around with it how you will. Comedy The comedy in One Piece is very good as the show does have this overall lighthearted tone which mainly comes from its comedy and it goes well. I also would like to say that One Piece does well to balance the tone between comedy and seriousness. Sound The soundtrack for One Piece is solid because it really does make it feel like a pirate theme adventure. So don't expect some rock or techno within One Piece's soundtrack. The sound effects for One Piece are great with the attacks, motion, etc. Art style and Animation At first the art style would seem very childish and silly, however you will eventually get use to it and even start to appreciate it since the art style is unique and anime for the most part has a similar art style. The animations are fine, don't expect something like Madhouse quality animation because since its a very long series, they won't have enough budget to make all the episodes top notch so its fine for what it is. And it can be very good in some scenes. Overall Conclusion One Piece is a very good series that is worth getting into. Its not perfect and has some flaws but the since there is a lot to like in One Piece, the positives outweigh the negative so they won't be much of a bother for the overall experience. Although I would say it is better to marathon the series rather than watch it weekly as I have stated the pacing is slow so not much would happen if you are watching weekly.",8,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a653a6f3a6,9
"I would enjoy this if i were a 6 years old who have to choose between this and teletubbies. My huge problems with this anime: 1# Art: Yeah it's the worst, still after the time skip. It's good for a kid's show for 1-10 years olds. 2# Story: Simple and irrelevant. Just an endless and overstretched journey. 3# Characters: Retarded main character who has a 5 years olds mindset even in life and death situations. Support characters and bad guys are more interesting until they turn into irritating idiots. For example: Weddinguu Caaakyyyy!!!!!!!! over countless episodes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) #4 Pacing: Did u know? The legendary pirate Gold Roger... -_-"", then 5 minutes from the previous episode, then overstreched let's look eachother and i will deafeat you just because i'm a main character!

"When I first heard about one piece I was nearly overflown with the hype the fans were giving it, saying it was the best thing ever, that anyone who dares to call themselves an anime fan should at the very least reconsider watching it, or either the haters would complain that this 600+ series has been pushing themselves forward way to long and just need to end already. I gave this series a try, evenually I got hooked up so bad, I watched the entire series in just a spawn of 3 months, and all I got to say about it is, I absolutely love it. don't even doubt about the fact whether you want to watch this show or not, watch this show right now, this instant. one piece is literally for anyone out there, children, teens, adults, male, and even female may enjoy it undoubtely. one piece is one of the best shounens out there, and has all his right to earn this title. the writers succeed in knitting this long running story so well together that it just fits perfectly. every introduced character plays it's part, everything that happens has a value, may it be momental, huge or even way later in the future of the show. this show doesn't understand the concept of exaggerating, may it be of the wacky character personalities, designs, the downright crazy devil fruit powers, wacky islands, inhuman myths and introduces you to crossdressers, mermaids, fishmen and giants in the show like it's the most normal thing ever. characters: the characters in one piece most definitely has to be one of it's strongest points. the main characters are so well developed that it's impossible to hate any straw hat pirate. from the easy-minded but pure hearted rubber captain ,Monkey D luffy, to the headstrong loyal swordsmen ,roronoa zoro, from the wimp sniper ,usopp who later slowly but surely develops in a dependable and strongwilled crewmember, the characters which are introduced in the spawn of the series surely aren't left out either. one piece expands from a variety of all different kinds of characters and backstories which all in all are unique on their own, from the way they speak, laugh, how they behave, their ideals, every character is memorable and they own carry their own value to the evenual story. art: though, I gotta confess that I honestly had to get used to the art of one piece at first. the mouths were way to weird for me, the females were way to thin, and some features seemed to be rather bad. after a few episodes it just eventually stopped bothering me, after you got used to it you don't even know why you would dislike it in the first place. it's just another segment to make one piece more unique and if you're in the story more deeper you end up simply enjoying it. I can understand that some people don't have the ability to get used to it, but don't let it bother you one bit. you won't regret it. Music: it ain't yuki kajiura material, but it also isn't necessairy. the music fits in the background of one piece just perfectly, some BGM are memorable and just downright beautiful/epic. everytime I listen to the soundtrack used for a sad moment in enies lobby arc I start sobbing again. enjoyment: one piece is one of the best series I have ever watched in my life, out of all the anime I've watched, this most definitely is my favorite. it's unique, enjoyable, it makes you push your nose against the screen in the exciting moments, it succeeds to make you sob in the sad moments, this series is most certaintly a long one, and hasn't dried out in the least bit, and also won't be up until the very end. do you need to watch one piece? hell yeah you do. and why: because you're missing out of a whole lot, if at the very least you don't wanna reconsider watching this masterpiece.",10,Recommended,"Apr 30, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_07db6897ef,9
"Note:This review is based on the original Japanese dub not the English dub. This is one of those shows that require no introduction but just in case you do need one. The show centers around the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew and the adventures that they go on so that they can each accomplish their dreams and goals. It is one of the many few shonen anime that can keep my attention and keep me engaged and excited for the next episode. Story 9/10 The story might seem very simple on the surface, but as you get further into the anime, the show begins to show layers with many themes of friendship, trust, loss, and many different things that drive the show. The story really has many layers that can't necessarily be explained by words,so i'll leave judgment of story up to the viewers, but in my opinion the story isn't the only thing that makes this show amazing. Characters 10/10 I believe that One Piece has an amazing diverse cast of characters with most if not all characters being able to be well developed in the amount of time that they get. All the characters are memorable, lovable, and outright very well developed. Enough so that they make me actually care for each character that is introduced. The characters truly make up the world and really push the enjoyment factor so high I wish I could rate it higher. Art 7/10 Due to this being a weekly shonen show with many many episodes the animation is bound to have its ups and downs, but when the animations shines it really shines and when it doesn't, it shows. Sound 9/10 The music and voice acting of this show is amazing. I can't tell you how many times I will hum one of the many opening songs or instrumental pieces while I'm outside. There are some times when I don't really like some of the voices of some characters but that is just from my own personal opinion. Overall 10/10 There are some flaws that I have not mentioned but I believe that this show overshadows all those flaws with it's amazing world, fantastic cast of characters, and amazing storytelling. I would recommend One Piece to anyone. One Piece really is in my opinion a truly amazing anime.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_89b20f5ed2,9
"One Piece delivers an infectious joy and energy during its standout episodes, but the pacing often stumbles into repetitive lulls that strain the viewing experience. The humor, while well-intentioned, doesn't always land consistently, leading to stretches of filler that test your patience. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, with each highly anticipated episode reigniting the hype, only for the bad stuff that comes with it to resurface, to extend the wait for more substantial plot progression. The slower episodes feel like treading water, lacking of anything meaningful really most of the time, despite the occasional entertaining moment, i sometimes had to fast forward through some episode, which i had never done yet, forcing myself to continue as the praise and recommendation it is getting. When One Piece hits its stride with fast-paced action, tight scripting, and impressive animation, it's truly a sight to behold, especially when you’re filling invested at this point it’s allons-y like a casino, and we’re all gamblers waiting to see our investissement return and sometimes lie to our self because we can’t face the fact that we had to watch an enormous amount of bad episodes. When it’s good the energy and excitement are palpable, reaffirming the series' status as a timeless classic. The music, and voice acting really does match what the animation trying to bring making a nice combination, even tho a bit childish sometimes, as for the trio (voice,animation,music). Ultimately, One Piece remains a remarkable achievement in the realm of manga, with unforgettable high points that showcase its enduring appeal. But as for the anime it’s just tough to endure, especially since the show doesn’t really have significant mindboggling moment as luffy and all the crew end up unscathed almost every time, and their level up with no real training sometime that could be more shown in the more boring/lackluster episodes makes it a little easy sometimes when they/he gets strong all of a sudden. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of quality content may leave some longing for more consistently engaging storytelling ,and for the more focussed ones of y’all, it will payout when great episodes comes out. I’m putting a stop to my journey as I’m definitely feeling like I only will end up more and more disliking the show maybe I’ll take it back later like a good old love/hate toxic relationship. In the end respect other’s reviews, everyone have a different view and palate for everything in this world. And you’re feeling is not universal.. for my part the note is really quite low because of the disgust I have for it right now but I’ll update ofc if I change my mind.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 28, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c7e9923730,9
"Now before fanboys get mad at me I'm just goint to say I love One Piece very much, it's one of my favorite manga of all time. It's thorough, colorful and exciting. But I have a LOT of problems with the anime. Story: The story is good, it's serviceable. Luffy goes out on an adventure to become king of the pirates. A very generic concept but once he assembles his crew (Zoro, Sanji, Chopper, Nami and Usopp specifically) things get a lot more exciting. The villains (ESPECIALLY CROCODILE) stand out a lot because of how different they are from each other. There's a lot of good guys in the marines and there's a lot of good pirates on the sea so it creates this gray area which is extremely interesting. Now for my problem with the anime, the pacing is absolute DOGSHIT and I really don't think there's an excuse for it at this point. Look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, it is another really long manga but it's gotten through 3 LONG story arcs without going over 100 episodes. One Piece takes its sweet time going through things and it really hurts the experience. I'm only on episode 45 of the anime because I can't handle sitting down and watching the 700 something episodes while I'm caught up with the manga Art: The style faithfully adapts Oda's work its based off of. Although at times it looks pretty awful and uncanny valley (ESPECIALLY NAMI'S FACE JESUS CHRIST SHE LOOKS SCARY AT TIMES.) I understand looking ugly some frames, it comes with animation but lord it's really bad sometimes. Like I said, the anime's style faithfully represents Oda's original work BUT it's still pretty ugly at times and I'm not talking about the random frames, I'm talking about just looking at the anime. Oda's artwork didn't translate super well into anime form. Sound: The voice actors in both the japanese version but everybody knows how shit the 4kids dub is at this point. I don't even have to talk about it. Just listen to the pirate rap and you'll understand. The voice actors in that version are so shit they take away the emotional power of some very sad scenes its that bad. Character: This is the part where the anime succeeds with flying colors (mainly because it's pretty difficult to fuck up characters from the source material but you get me.) The strawhat gang especially are well done compared to the big 3's main character and their ""crews."" The strawhats all have aspirations outside of Luffy's big dream, they all feel individual instead of desperately clinging to the mc's goal. My personal favorite strawhat is Zoro, he's been there since day 1 and he's extremely loyal. Unlike other anime characters, he doesn't forget his dream when he goes with Luffy and he continues to train. The villains are also pretty amazing, Crocodile is a cruel and sadistic pirate who watched four people who wanted to fight him die slowly while he laughed, Akainu is a bastard (One piece fans will understand why he is, spoilers) and Blackbeard is cowardly scum you DESPERATELY want to watch lose Enjoyment: IT'S ONE PIECE! If you're a fan of the manga you're gonna enjoy the anime, it's a faithful adaptation that doesn't leave anything out as far as I've seen. It's great seeing some of my favorite pirates in motion even though the animation leaves a little bit to be desired. I really highly recommend this if you're too lazy to read the manga and you still want to experience One Piece. It's shonen action at it's finest. I hope you enjoy the story as much as I am.",8,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1a927e51ee,9
"After seeing the scores I have given this anime, many people might be confused by my overall score. Don't get me wrong, One Piece is my favorite manga, hands down. The story is wonderful, the characters are great, the art style is unique and colorful. However, One Piece is a long running shounen manga that is no where near being finished. Usually with these types of series, the anime will add in long filler arcs to allow the manga to put out more material for the main story. Naruto and Bleach are notorious for this and even Fairy Tail had to resort to doing this as well. During its early years, One Piece did this as well, but currently it has resorted to animating one chapter per episode. And this leads to an enormous amount of filler in each episode. Fights are drawn out. Running places takes five episodes. An entire conversation or death scene can take up a full episode. After a while, this sort of thing gets very frustrating, and I have had to put the anime on hold twice now. Another issue I have with this show is the animation and this also ties in with the filler problem. The animation is very sloppy and its pretty bad when you're watching an episode and notice at least three separate occasions where the same animation is used (I'm pointing fingers at you, Coliseum animation!). The animation will also pan over crowds or go between different characters for 15-30 seconds to fill time, and it could be that no one is actually speaking at all during this. Honestly, if you're really interested in getting into One Piece, I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. You'll only get frustrated with the filler and animation. EDIT: As mentioned above, I have dropped this series twice: once in Puck Hazard and once in Dressrosa. I am currently four episodes into the Mink/Zou arc and am probably three episodes away from finally rage quitting this horribly animated adaption of my favorite manga. The filler is unbelievable and the animation is terrible. DO NOT watch this anime past the Timeskip if you are interested in One Piece. Please, for the love of god, just read the manga.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 13, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5ce162a9b2,10
"The story of One Piece is a long and enjoyable experience. It makes you care for the characters and their bonds; you become emotionally invested in their success. However, the anime is a disappointment to say the least. The length of scenes are stretched to a ridiculous degree. Every episode covers one chapter, but that includes an intro song, an outro song, and a long unnecessary recap. If you catch up you will constantly be waiting a week just for the characters to almost do something. and as the series gets farther into the story the animation gets worse. If you are interested in this series; read the manga. Its a great story, but the anime just isn't worth the time investment.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 26, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_205bc24d8f,10

The art style, yes a big issue for allot of people who considerd this anime and didnt watch it because of the art style....but if you remember it well this is a review about the 10 GOOD things so that means the art style isnt a bad thing. actually its refreshing and suprisingly good. It shouldnt be anything difrent , if it would have it would be one piece as we know it....maybe its difficult to get into it because it isnt high end drawings but still it makes it unique and thats why its still good when its bad. 9. Pirates....it isnt my fav subject around on this world actually beside pirates of the carab i never liked things about pirates....whats with the old ships, the crappy heads and the drinking all the time anyway? but this made the pirate genre so difrent so new that after watching this serie you will love them....maybe because its not really traditional pirates....its more like a comination between fantasy and the good old pirate work....and still you will see allot of big characters in the pirate world that you will remember of from stories like disney. 8. the world....yes this is something that comes right after the subject pirates....because its unique in its own way and still something that shouldnt have been used to begin with...a whole world made out of water and island.....you would think it would be boring because even after a few of episodes from pokemon when they where traveling around islands it got boring....but this wont.....you will notice sometimes they stick around on an island for tons of eps and still you wont be bored....the world has allot of favriations but but still not that much that you will get lost....great design of the world ^^ 7. villain....yes, they are awesome, they are scary....but not too scary, they are funny but not that much that you wont take them sirious anymore and even if you take them sirious and you are scared of them they still will make you laugh at some point.....sometimes they are all fun sometimes they are all sirous but most of the time they are an combination of both and they have awesome attacks, unique abilities and last but not least some weird way of always returning and never actually die.....its up too you if thats a good or bad thing. 6. npc's....yes i shouldnt call them no playable caracters but you feel for the crew of the luffys ship but you never actually feel compasion about the people surounding them....only a few times but that s because they are longer in the storie then a few eps....anyway, the people who help the strawhead crew are great they give that little bit of extra to make the story going on even when it gots boring..... 5. the ship.....i wont go on about this for too much but at some point you will even care about the ship where our heroes sail on.... 4. the music....yes its a big deal, maybe not from the start but the anime has about over 400 episodes now and still allot of the sounds are still being used from episode 1.....this makes it special because after about 100 eps you will remember them you will sing them in your head and you will c rave for the ost to have....even the opening and ending songs are great, various, and original.... 3. humor....yes, comedy is a big deal in this anime....even at times you dont expect it its there and you want it to be there....be affraid, because your tummy will hurt when you watch a few eps in a row ^^ 2. the crew....the strawhead crew is one of those things that makes this show go how it goes.....they have allot of histroy and backgrounds, they are unique and original designd and they have their own flaws but also their own powers....they are difrent then all the other caracters in this anime and thats why its a good choice they are almost in every episode ^^ 1. the story.....yes this is I think the best thing about this anime.....the story, not only will you not expect an anime drawn this simple have a very deep story at some points, also you wont expect to actually tear and cry because of it....you want to watch all those 400+ eps because you WANT to know how it goes further.....you will be on a story rush 24/7....even the fillers are great, funny and deep enough to watch them....and to be honest i think if a story is great about an anime its already worth watching even all the other things dont work for you.... Thats why i recomend dont hold back because of the art style or the weird sence of humor sometimes and keep watching .....after 30/50 eps you will be hooked and smack yourself on the head blaiming yourself you didnt watch it to begin with ^^",9,Recommended,"Jun 27, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_52cd2920ba,10
"One Piece for me is probably the greatest piece of work I've ever seen come from an anime creator. The incredible thing has nothing to do with the art or the special effects, but rather the powerful emotion drawn from within many of the scenes incited by the characters. The emotional scenes draw out the full potential and strength of the main characters which makes them look really (how should i say it ""nutz"" or ""kickass""). If that isn't enough, its flawless storyline brings out something more and more and as the story goes on and on and every little event comes into detail which all connects together for the preparation of an incredible event yet to come.

"'One Piece' is an enduring and iconic anime series that has left an indelible mark on the world of anime and manga. Boasting a vast and intricate narrative, the series introduces viewers to the captivating adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his eclectic crew of pirates as they navigate the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece. The anime, while occasionally criticized for its slow pacing, delivers a compelling storyline filled with rich character development, emotional depth, and a myriad of imaginative worlds. The diverse range of characters, each with their unique abilities and backstories, adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, making it a truly immersive experience. The art style, though distinct and not as polished as some more recent series, carries a charm that has endeared 'One Piece' to fans worldwide. The animation quality may not always match the standards of newer, seasonal anime, but it remains consistent throughout the series, considering its long and continuous run. It's important to acknowledge that 'One Piece' is not a seasonal anime, and its longevity requires a different viewing perspective. Comparisons to newer, shorter series should be tempered by the understanding of the unique challenges faced by a show that has been ongoing for such an extended period. In conclusion, 'One Piece' deserves commendation for its compelling narrative, diverse characters, and the cultural impact it has had over the years. Despite its imperfections, it stands as a testament to the power of long-form storytelling in the anime medium.

"I decided to watch One Piece when a filler-arc started in Boruto and it looked as if it would not be ending anytime soon. I needed something else to watch and a friend recommended “One Piece”.I thought why not and decided to give it a try. A few minutes in to the first episode, I was a bit put off by the weird art style and this very childish atmosphere, but since I had nothing else to watch, I kept at it.. Till About episode 130 I saw the Protagonist Luffy go on Adventures on his ship, gathering more crew-mates and Basically having fun trying to right the wrongs in his world. A crazy world filled “Devil fruits” and islands in the sky. Pretty interesting stuff, But i didnt think it was anything to be crazy about. Then “Water-7” and “War Summit” happened. To me these two story arcs are some of the best Ever among all the anime i have seen. The pace, story, and characterization were all perfect and Whats more, it widened the world of one piece and I realized that there were a Lot more mysteries waiting to be revealed. I had Officially become a fan of One Piece. No doubt the best anime of all time. From the starting of episode 1 till now this anime has never let my hopes down. I have known many people saying they have not watched one piece because of its length but I guarantee this that this anime is worth that many episodes. The best thing about this anime is every arc is better than the last one.

"My personal opinion is simple: I really like it, but the pacing is a hurdle. What fueled me to start the series is that I didn't want to get spoiled. It has its moments, but you have to GRIND through HOURS of flashbacks. There aren't even that many filler episodes, so you just have to sit through and endure, picking pieces of information, plot and character development throughout the whole series until you arrive at the key moments of each arc, the payout after all the buildup. This series is only recommended for anyone who feels like enduring the challenge of sitting through it. If you're into reading manga, I highly recommend reading it. The story, characters and the world are well written and the pacing is good, I'd say it only depends on your reading speed. I'm editing this review in the future once I'm caught up with the damned thing and give it a proper rating score, because it's a piece of art in development so it's not fair to give it a rating this early into the show (800 eps in lol). One of the reasons why I'm not making a full review now is its animation. It displays the history of the evolution of analogue TV and hand-drawn animation, to the current digital broadcasting and computer-generated animation. And I know that it's evolving even further, with the latest arcs showing off some gorgeous scenes that showcase masterful animation techniques. These are details that I want to put into consideration for my full review. That being said, I'm never changing my ""Mixed feelings"" recommendation because; I'll say it again: the pacing is AWFUL. This series isn't something that can simply be recommended to anyone.

"Alright, being my favourite anime/manga, I feel a need to review this. One Piece starts off on a pretty average note. Nothing spectacular. Being a very old show (started in 1997), the art is quite shitty at first. To drop the show because of this reason alone is a bad mistake. Think of it more like a fine wine that ages exceedingly well over time. Moving on, ""it looks too childish"". I've heard that a lot from people who haven't watched it, and I'm sure I even thought it myself at one point. Sadly, Oda's unique art style does look very stylized and might be difficult to get used to. Give it a few episodes however and you will realized that the art lends itself to the plot perfectly. The designs are unique and the settings are creative. Without a doubt, you will love it in no time. It's quite fair to mention that Oda is a huge fan of exposition and meticulous planning. Love it or hate it, it only serves to add that extra layer of depth to the story. All his story arcs have a lasting impact and he never forgets about the characters he introduces. The unbelievable lack of any real plot holes in such a long running series demonstrates his attention to detail and love of his craft. Sure, many of you will scoff when you hear One Piece is a masterpiece. Really thou, I scoff at that too. Oda makes mistakes like any author and the plot moves quite slow at some points (a disease mostly exclusive to the anime). However, what One Piece excels at is its sheer amount of entertainment. So what if it's not Shakespeare. It will definitely bring you more fun than Hamlet ever would. Overall, One Piece has grown on me like no story ever has. Throw away your doubts and give it try. Before you know it, you'll only be wanting more. ---Common misconceptions and preposed solutions--- -Think you're too mature for ""shounen shit""? Get over yourself. -Not a fan of long ass anime? Read the manga! I highly recommend it as it is devoid of the many pacing issues present in the anime. -Actively hate on it because it's part of the Big 3? Again, get over yourself. ""Big 3"" is an incredibly moronic way to lump three totally different manga together just because of their sales. -Hate it because of the fans? Hate the fans, not the author. Make your own decision on the story based on YOUR experience. -Don't like the concept of pirates?

"One Piece is a super long anime about pirates. The aspect of pirates is still there as the show progresses but fades into the background. Aside from that I feel One Piece is one of the greatest anime's of all time. The shows as such amazing characters. The debates of who is the best characters can get a room of watchers all fired up. The main characters have so many iconic character traits to make the stand out. Even supporting character can get your emotions flowing. One Piece is an emotional roller coaster. It can take you from happy to angry the to balling your eyes out in just a few episodes. things will get fore shadowed hundreds of episodes early. the world created in One Piece has so much lore, wonders and mysteries from sky islands to fish men. Some people do not like art of One Piece but i think its what makes it so much more like able and original. The openings will get you pump up every time you start an episode. This is my favorite anime i hope it can touch you the same way it does me.",9,Recommended,"Jan 31, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6176c3360c,10

"You stumbled across this page, because you wondered what is One Piece, but probably, your most important question, that has been poking your mind since some time is: Should I watch it? Now the basic facts. There are currently 688 episodes aired, and that's probably bit more than half of the planned material Eiichiro Oda (the manga creator) has . To catch up to the current arc you would need to sacrifice around 40 average anime series (or you could do just a lot of different staff in your life, right?). That's more than ten days of constant watching. So how to measure if it's worth it? How to benchmark it? Before you will read further you need to be totally aware of one thing: the anime is slow, the pacing is awful, more so then ever in the newest arcs. It's like they are trying to squeeze all the money they can from the audience (the Toei animation studio), the same thing that Naruto is currently doing. Also, the anime in my opinion, has a pretty much a love/hate relationship going on, and to measure it for yourself, you would need to consider watching around 100-110 episodes. Now if compared to 700 or 1000 it's or even more it's not that bad... The reason for that, is that the real action begins with the Alabasta Saga (saga consists of few arcs), that starts at episode 62. If the Alabasta Saga won't get your full attention, you will feel forced to stare at the screen etc., dislike this and that, then you should consider dropping One Piece for your own safety. If, on the other hand, you will find yourself immersed in the anime, waiting impatiently before you can watch the next episode, welcome on the love train. Also consider this. One thing is to watch anime that has the standard 12-24 episodes (or just a bunch of seasons), another thing is to watch anime that has hundreds of episodes. Obviously, to keep the quality level constant in such big series (or manga series for the fact) is just impossible. If you won't like Alabasta, it will be hard to keep on watching later. Now there are better arcs then Alabasta, but do you want to watch another 100 episodes just to get to them? All in all, the best way, from the neutral point of view would be just to write down the aspects that create One Piece, make it what it is, and depend on how you respond to them, watch or just leave, it's just as simple as that, having of course in mind what I wrote above: • Humor with mix of goofing around • Slow, bad pacing at times • Long Battles - full shounen style • Good Story that connects all the Sagas • Great Characters with their own personal story (especially the crew) • Many black and white characters, you are either good or bad • Simple, meaningful emotions, that even the youngest audience will understand (especially friendship) • Repetitive at times • Very good voice acting ( I am NOT watching a dubbed version) • Pretty much no death • Just decent music and art even in the newest arcs • Enormous world and enormous amount of characters that you will stumble across your journey • Creativity regarding the laws, history, organizations, countries, buildings (size of some of them is truly astounding) and most obviously all the POWERS the shounen characters get • Predictable at times • Generally, over the top design of many aspects of the manga and anime • Misconception regarding some terms: like pirates, government, marines etc. Know the author of this simple review is a bit of fan of series, but I tried to stay as objective as possible. So the high score for me is obvious. Thanks for reading.",9,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c07b73edac,10
One piece is a great shounen series. Some people might wonder why I put the score so low. We are talking about the anime here thats why. At first the animation was fine but later on after the new world it became terrible. Pacing is too slow and the animators are lazy. I would have given early one piece anime a 6 or a 7 but overall its not that good. I still recommend the anime because at times some scenes are done better than in the manga and the story of one piece is still interesting. just don't expect something top quality,5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 14, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_36b1c06120,10
"Such a horrible fate One piece has to find himself being produced by Toei Animation studios. There is no doubt that one piece is awesome if we talk about the story. The universe is attracting, characters are lovable and it follows a certain logic that fit perfectly the shounen manga world, from this point of view you will definitly have a hard time finding a manga with such big and coherant world and at the same time light-hearted. So story 8/10. [IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH ONE PIECE PASS ONTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT HINT ABOUT THE STORY] The only problem that i could spot in the story is the recent developpement of Sanji,Usopp and Brook. The author has quite ignored sanji and brook, and make usopp a good for nothing, succeeding in enormous proportions because of his luck and not his will to become a great pirate. And that sacrifice of the character only for some gags that are not funny is in my point of view very absurd. If we were 5 Years in the past and you were telling me Usopp's storyline from the dressrosa Arc, i'm not sure if i would want to talk with you again... For the character developpement, i'm sadened that the author of the pillar of the shounen world (so children story) actually has the systematic tendency to over-sexualise the body of the women in his story. The binary vision of the pretty women with big boobs and a perfect waist in the opposite of the ugly women is really disturbing and can opress the lector. Because of these two point i gave 6/10 note for Characters. Soundtrack is awesome and voice characters too so : 8/10. When in the vast majority of anime adaptations the anime make the story even more interesting and pretty. One piece is the exact inverse case. From static plans being abused to bad drawings, bad and awfully long animations and a pacing utterly slow, the dynamics of fights is impacted negatively. It's because the studio has make the awfull choice to animate one chapter per episode, have you seen in an anime a character yelling 2 times in the same scene his attack's name, then you haven't seen one piece anime. Some scene are very far from being honest with the manga. So i put 1/10 for the Art. Overall, don't lose your time watching one piece anime, buy the books you'll definitly enjoy better the story. I put 1/10 Overall because i think 8/10 for this anime is defintely too much, i would put 4/10, but my opinion is that this anime does not represent the manga correctly. It's not for nothing that a project named ""One pace"" (Removing all sort of bad scene) exist for this series.",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7321d4cf6a,10
"Personally I have tried 4 times to get into this series (reading and watching). Each time something different has been a turn off for me but I know there are a lot of people on the other side of the fence. So I guess give it a try. My big 3 reasons for not liking this series 1.) I am not gonna rag on it to much but like some of the other comments mention the art style is not for everyone, I can't deal with it for very long myself. 2.) The characters. This is somewhat of a nitpick and I have heard now since they are on episode like 800+ and some crazy amount of manga chapters some of this has been remedied but outside of Luffy,Zoro,Nami, and Sanji the other characters for the main cast are flat out annoying. 3.) The length. I understand that for some people this doesn't bother them cause they have been reading since day 1. I don't have 3 lifetimes to spend trying to get caught up with this. If you are someone who has limited time due to life this is not for you if you want to have any idea what is currently going on. While I am not trying to give much away but with all the strange adventures that this series covers I was informed after so many episodes they made it to the grand line where they were trying to go for so long just to sail right back away from it? At this point can't tell if they are just trying to drag it out for every penny its worth or if there is story they couldn't continue in a spin off.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 3, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7c4d183929,11
"Man.. every week I await for the arrival of a new episode , there was not a single letdown, the episodes rarely had repetition of previous chapters and is always filled with new content Story 8/10 Oda is a brilliant author, many folks would just believe one piece is a pirate killing and blundering things. One piece is a story of a young boy whom aspired to be a pirate, his immature, reckless and stubborn often give author no choice but to admire his actions. The plot twists and the slow foreshadowing of unrevealed characters such as the Yonko, shichibukai and navy admirals always kept readers in suspense. However the episode may be dragged unnecessarily, creating a turnoff Art 8/10 The animation is great, it depicts the characters flawlessly. Toei animation also paid attention to even the smallest details, which readers would spot and would propose various theories in their mind. However there were moments where the animators fail to design the character fully, giving them a somewhat distorted face, thus a 8/10 Sound 8/10 SHINING RUNNING FOREVER and the battle music is sick. But some openings were just damn terrible, the overused yelling and screaming can be annoying at times. Character 8/10 A solid 10/10, the character development such as the time skip period is perfected. Fueled with sadness and despair once a relative dies, the characters development closely reflects those in real life. The process is insane, as story progresses, the 10 main characters takes on tougher opponents. Enjoyment 9/10 Funny, action-packed and mind-blowing, One Piece is without doubt a very enjoyable manga. The moments when a serious situation is overridden by a hilarious comment is very funny.

"I think the question as to whether you love or hate One Piece has already been answered for most people, myself included. So in this review I don't really want to focus on One Piece as a whole, but rather the half of One Piece that I like to call ""Toei Timeskip."" Whether you love or hate One Piece, it's really hard to deny that its current state is a fucking travesty right now. Damn I'm pretty sure I'd even give pre-Toei timeskip an 8 if I could, but I can't because everything afterward goes down the drain. I was tolerating it for awhile, but they really went full Toei on the Dressrosa arc so my patience has run thin on this anime. The most glaring issue to me is the pacing. Regardless of whether or not you care for the quality of the show, I'm sure you still want to at least watch some damn anime at the end of the day. Yet you have to go through roughly 5 minutes of the Toei logo, long ass theme song, and the narrator recapping the last episode. Then when you get to the actual show, it's just another 4 minutes of the same shit you saw last episode until it finally gets to the actual content in One Piece. And even then, the actual content might just be a flashback episode or a bunch of unnecessarily drawn out talking/running scenes. I can't tell if this was a ploy from Toei so they wouldn't catch up to the manga as fast or if it was just a way to fill up the 22 minute segment but either way it's infuriating as hell. I just want to watch some goddamn anime, not ""One Piece: Recap Central."" Another issue is the animation. I have no idea how it got this way. I'm not gonna speculate on whether or not it's because of Toei's big work load on other anime or if they stopped caring, but either way it looks awful. There's so many reused stiff animations that look like super floaty, almost as if the characters all have a devil fruit that lets them fly. It's clear that Toei can do better as their opening themes and movies have good/great animation (second gear in the movies looks orgasmic), but for some reason we are stuck with this animation for now and it looks like it isn't getting any better. To top the animation off, the cheap sound effects make it even more unbelievable. So many sounds are reused that you'll notice it even if you aren't trying to listen for it. Most sounds have this weird static effect attached to it for some reason even if the attack does not call for it. It takes all the impact out of the attacks, the only thing that gives the attacks any impact at all is the VAs which arguably is the only thing carrying One Piece right now. It's a shame that One Piece is in this state cause it's one of the Shounens I have the most passion about. In its current state it is just a solid 4. I'd recommend reading the manga if you care about seeing the story without any of the bullshit that Toei puts in between. One Piece is really awful right now and I hope it improves in the future.",4,Not Recommended,"Oct 14, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_35929e2198,11
"[Spoilers Warning] [One Piece Fanboys Warning, Feelings May Be Hurt] This is likely to be my longest review, which makes sense because this is the longest anime I'll ever watch. I'm currently 1000 episodes in, watching the Wano arc. So I can for sure say I'm allowed my opinion, and I realise many people won't like it, because this is one of the most beloved animes ever made. I will say, though, this COULD have been one of my all time favourite animes, and I'm going to tell you why it isn't. Firstly I want to talk about the positives. Absolutely awesome world building, my favourite parts of One Piece are usually when they're about to go to a new island, and we're going to discover a new culture, and have some sort of adventure with some new people, in which one of them may join the crew. Two, I love some of the characters they've given us, there are some brilliant characters who I really enjoy watching, and I'll give a rundown of my thoughts on characters after my third point. My third point is that they have some great comedy between the characters, and this especially stands out when they're travelling around before they reach their destination. The sound is generally also good in One Piece, and I'll give a little shout out to the animation. The animation is actually good in my eyes, that goes hand in hand with some good fight scenes, and I mean early One Piece I still liked the animation. It has a really friendly feeling to it, and in more recent episodes it has become super smooth at points. When I seen the arrival of Kaido as a dragon, the animation of his body moving, slinking, and coiling towards them, was well done. So for this part, I'm going to do the main cast, and put them into a tier list, with a little explanation of why they're there. Then after I'll talk broadly about the entire cast. (Once again, this is just my opinion, I know people will disagree) Main Cast; A Tier - Robin, Nami, Chopper B Tier - Zoro, Usopp C Tier - Jimbei, Sanji D Tier - Luffy, Franky, Brook So, Nico Robin for me works well because she's nothing like the rest of the crew, there was a running gag for a long time that she was the only one on the crew who didn't partake in their, well, gags. So her joke is that she doesn't do jokes. I also love her humour around just saying really terrifying, or messed up things so nonchalantly. Her mature demeaner is also a nice break from having the others constantly acting like they're 10 years old, only acting with their first instincts without any thought. Nami for me is just an all around cool character, and I'm gonna shock you here, but I've enjoyed her fights, because she actually has to use her brain instead of just ""I'm gonna endure all your punishment and outpunishment you!"". Chopper grew on me, and he's the perfect mascot for the crew, I enjoy his humour and general being. One thing that ties all these three up for me, though, is that they all have great character building, interesting backstories, and I got emotionally attached to all 3 of them because of it. Now, Zoro was A tier for me, for most of the show. I mean, he's a badass with 3 swords, in my opinion he has some of the very best fights in the whole of the show. He went down, because he doesn't really do anything? Like, he never has an input on what they're planning to do, I don't think we have even seen much of his backstory, and we don't really know too much about him as a person at this point. He had an awesome moment at the end of Thriller Bark, but honestly, what does he even add to the crew in the last 500 episodes? I know people will say ""he's their best fighter"", well, that's not true, Luffy is, Luffy defeats every bad guy, so he's clearly stronger than him. Usopp grew on me a LOT, I hated him for so long, but I did gradually come around. He would be A tier if he had some sort of character development besides changing his clothes? He's still the same cowardly type we met in episode 10, as he is now in episode 1000. Jimbei I'm indifferent to, and Sanji I just purely dislike because his fighting is boring, the amount of screen time we get of it zoomed in on his cigarette as he either lights it up, or just stands there, could probably fill an arc of its own by this point. I also am not a fan of the fact it took them near 850 episodes to give us his backstory. I do like when he says Robin and Nami's names, but other than that he's just a more overbearing Brock from Pokemon. Franky is just boring to me, and I'm not sure of the point in Brook? I liked him in Thriller Bark, but kinda wish they never added him to the crew. After the 5th time of him making the exact same ""I can't believe my eyes, oh well, I don't have any yohoho"" joke, it gets stale. And that's all he has to offer it seems? Luffy. Many people absolutely love this guy, and honestly, I have no idea why. He as a main character is truly boring, and far too much of the show revolves around him. I don't like his fights, stretching is just a boring power, he does the same old ""I like food"" joke that we've seen a thousand times in other anime. He doesn't progress as a character, at all, he is still the exact same person as he was in episode 1. Before fire fist dying, he didn't even have an interesting backstory, all it was is ""he met a pirate called Shanks, and promised to him that he'd become King of the Pirates"". Luffy is one of my biggest problems with One Piece. To compare what I think is an actual truly good front character, with Luffy, let's talk about Naruto. Naruto had crazy amounts of development as a character in that show, and they did it in less episodes, too. He went from being a stroppy, dumb, antisocial, kind of an ass, to being a super outgoing, popular, thoughtful person, who even would think through his fights before just rushing in like he would at the beginning. Luffy doesn't showcase this at all, no matter how many times his crew have almost been killed, he doesn't think, ever, his head is empty, he see's an enemy, and he just rushes in not knowing what their power level is, or their devil fruit ability. Moving onto my favourite characters across the whole anime. Fire Fist Ace, Nico, Chopper, Nami, Aokiji, Fujitora, and Law. This isn't to mention all the other awesome characters they have Doflamingo, Kuma, Crocodile, Eustass Kid, Caesar Clown, Akainu, Kizaru, and here's one from the memory banks, Kuro. I bet I have even missed out a bunch of other cool characters. My problem here is that, with the longest running anime of all time, 1000+ episodes, and some of these awesome characters have BARELY appeared. Are you kidding me? We've seen Shanks far far more in flashbacks than the actual anime, the guy who essentially started off One Piece by inspiring Luffy, and we NEVER see him. Aokiji, holy fuck has there been a better introduction to a character in an anime? Guy is just asleep, chilling. Fucks them up with ease, and then rides his bike across the ocean. But then guess what? We don't see him again for another 200 episodes, and even in that, it wasn't in any meaningful way. After Marineford, again, he's gone until a cameo appearing at the end of Punk Hazard, and we haven't seen him since. What in the fuck is with this writing, instead of using the already build world of great characters, they just throw them in the bin to carry on making newer, less interesting ones like Carrot???? How many characters do they introduce, and then focus on, just for that arc. During Arabasta, we met Vivi, which I thought was not a bad thing, because at this point we only have 5 Straw Hats, let alone a world filled with characters. After Marineford, we have so, many, characters, we do not need to move to new places, and spend 30+ episodes on backstory for some new characters that aren't fresh or interesting. Dressrosa brought in a bunch of them, the king, his daughter, her husband amongst others that I just didn't care about. Overall, my problem with their use of characters is mostly just the lack of them being actually used, and constant focus on newer characters when we already have 50+ we can play around with. The lack of character development isn't huge, but I'd like to see at least one or two changes in some people that isn't just appearance. Why hasn't Luffy learnt to be smarter when wanting to fight someone after he watches his brother die, and he thought his crew all died to Kuma. Why hasn't Usopp gotten a backbone after going through so many wars and fights. Why do the animators think giving Nico and Nami bigger boobs, and more cleavage, is character development? Also, Fire Fist Ace should have been the main character of One Piece, he had far more charisma, seemed far more intelligent, and actually was interesting to watch in a fight. Now, let's talk about the arcs (I told you this would be a long one). I don't wanna write a novel, so I'll be as concise as possible here and straight up say, that they made, FAR too many episodes for some of these arcs. Arabasta is the first arc that made me wanna quit watching because of how long it was, little did I know, 38 episodes would be a short arc in One Piece by the end. Although I did enjoy Skypiea, I don't know that it could have been a lot better having less than 42 episodes. Enies Lobby the same with 46 episodes. 51 for Fishman Island, 46 for Punk Hazard, 45 for Thriller Bark. And now here comes the killer, 118 episodes for Dressrosa. This arc here is the one that absolutely burned me out watching this show. Really, 118 episodes? My god, I'm getting Vietnam flashbacks thinking about this arc right now. 95 for whole cake island. And now we're currently 114 episodes deep into Wano Country. I realise people will say, ""but Seth, the more episodes, the more we can get backstory for characters, and build an emotional connection to them"", but do we really need that many? I'm gonna list off a few anime here which absolutely had people invested in the characters and what happened to them, and they did it in less episodes that all those arcs I just mentioned in the last paragraph. Steins:Gate - 24 Death Note - 37 Cowboy Bebop - 26 Neon Genesis Evangelion - 26 Heck, to make my point, just look at all the movies that build a world, build characters, give backstories and manage to have it all play out with people being emotionally invested in only 2 hours, which is let's say 4-5 episodes worth. Now, I'm not saying all animes should be shorter because of this, I'm merely pointing out One Piece has had far, far more than enough time to have every single character fleshed out by now, and we could have progressed the story a lot more than we currently have. Naruto is one of the greatest animes imo, although it went on a little longer than I thought it should, and I got a bit bored of it towards the end, at least in those 766 episodes we know so much about every character in that show. We know the entire history of the the world in Naruto, we seen every person have a fight with every other top character, we have seen some characters completely change through their development on the show, we seen all of it play out and finish in 766 episodes. By the 1000th episode on One Piece, we still don't know anything about the 100 year period in their history, we only JUST learnt about Gol D Roger, we still don't know too much about characters past like Zoro who have been in since the beginning of the show. We still don't know what the One Piece even is, we have 0 idea on how strong Shanks is, we have rarely seen all the top characters fight with one another, and I'm just not sure what we've been watching in replacement of all of that? New shittier characters than we already have? Focusing a tonne on characters that will be gone when the arc finishes and they leave the island? Spending half of the episodes doing flashbacks of previous episodes? (Naruto did this a lot as well). I will say, I enjoyed Thriller Bark even though that was 45 episodes long, but I felt that more of this was valuable, because the new character that we were introduced to, and had a bit of focus on for a few eps was Brook, who actually ended up joining the Straw Hats. It felt like this arc actually had a good focus on our already established crew, and we didn't get half of the arc showing us flashbacks of a character that we don't care about. Longer arcs can be good, but in One Piece they oftenly aren't imo, because they don't use the already built characters in the world that we care about, and they waste a tonne of time on pointless shit, stretching out the arcs needlessly. So, lastly, I'll do a quick run of my favourite arcs from first to last. Marineford - Most people's favourite, and it's obvious why. We had a bunch of big boys fighting it out, and I loved the dynamic of Garp being between his career/upholding what he thought was justice, and his family. Most importantly, this was only 33 episodes long. Only one downside was that only Luffy from the Straw Hats was in this arc, none of the others made it there, so we never got to see them in action versus the Navy's strongest. Still, overall a great arc though. Also, I wish they made Ace die on the podium, rather than make him look dumb as fuck by basically escaping, but then going back to be killed just because Akainu said ""ur mom gay"". Really did my boy dirty, and made Ace look stupid at the end there. Sabaody Archipelago - Introduced so many good characters, an arc that turned out huge for the story of One Piece, introducing the worst generation, Kuma sending everyone away, leading to a two year time skip, and we seen a lot of moving pieces within' the story in only 21 episodes. Maybe the biggest shock was that we seen the Straw Hats get dismantled so easily by Kuma, after watching them win almost all of their fights up until this point. It was the first time we seen the usual happy-go-lucky Luffy in a state of despair. Water 7 - One of the best countries they visit, unique, really cool theme, and nice bit of mystery with a fun twist in there. Really good setup for Enies Lobby, and most of the episodes were centred around Usopp, Nico, and Franky, three characters who are actually in the Straw Hats. Usopp vs Luffy was hard to watch, but a part of me wanted Usopp to get a reality check, and that he did. Him watching them sail away from him actually had me feeling for him, even despite Usopp's many flaws. Arlong Park - The arc that changed the vibe of the show from 'tehehe', to 'oh fuck'. This was one of the first credible threats to the Straw Hats, and I felt Nami's story, as well as her character, were told really well here. I sympathised with her immediately, and it made you want to see Arlong get his ass kicked. 14 episodes and it's still pretty memorable even now, nearly 1000 episodes later. Enies Lobby - Good arc, what might be the most heart wrenching moment of the show when Nico screams ""I WANT TO LIVE!"". Absolutely beautiful, and I loved that. I found most of the episodes that focused on the people moving through the city quite boring, but when they finally catch upto Nico and CP9, everything from there is great. People might ask me why it's not ranked higher, and that's because I felt Water 7 was enough build up, and then the train ride there. When we arrive, we still have to wait another 10 episodes for them to get through the city, at this point I'm blueballed. I realise people may say it's only 10 episodes! But that's over 3 hours of waiting for it. I'm being picky, I know, but that's just how I felt watching it, extremely bored until they stand on top of the courthouse, and what a moment that was. Thriller Bark - I know a lot of people don't like this arc, but I enjoyed it quite a lot, and it ended with one of the most memorable moments in the entire show. (Zoro-Kuma) It stands out because of the slight gothic-horror theme it sets. Robin rejecting Franky's robot transformation was also hilarious. It was good to see them all fight together as a team here. Little Garden - Very short and sweet, they only needed 8 episodes to tell us an interesting story of these two giants, that would be used further on in the One Piece timeline, and we got to see some fights involving Baroque Works. Skypiea - Best part about this arc was the journey to getting there, not knowing if the sky island even existed, and the mystery around all of it. It does get very slow when they arrive, and outside of Eneru, it was a bit too easy for the Straw Hats to beat everyone. Impel Down - A great prelude to Marineford, and it was really helped with the tension built during this arc. We see some old faces, as well as new ones, overall decent arc for what it was. Buggy actually became a pretty funny character in these episodes. Drum Island - Only 14 episodes long, but we get Chopper introduced, as well as a new snowy country, and Chopper's background is pretty good to watch. Wapol played a good villain, and we luckily didn't get 20 episodes showing us his backstory. Punk Hazard - Again, I know many don't like it, but I actually enjoyed it for the most part, glad to see Law involved as he's one of my favourites, it serves as a decent build up to Dressrosa. Syrup Village - This here is where I started to actually enjoy One Piece, the only thing I can say about it, is that I wish Kuro wasn't beaten so easily, I genuinely thought he was a pretty badass villain, but Luffy makes him look like a chump. Wano Country - Currently slogging through it, again spending an absurd amount of time on the history of this country, and the Akazaya Samurai. The flashbacks of Gol D Roger were great, but not enough added to the main story, or the main characters for the amount of episodes it's gotten so far imo. Zou Arc - Met some of the animes worst characters, the mink are really uninteresting, and annoying at times. The country itself initially was really cool to see, it was awesome to wonder about what happened to it, how it got there, and why it's on the back of an elephant, but that all went to shit through the reveals and characters who took up screen time. Orange Town - Not much to say beyond Buggy can be funny at times Baratie - Honestly can't remember much about this arc, I think I kept falling asleep during it until Zoro is defeated by Mihawk, that had my full attention, but by then the whole arc was almost done. Arabasta - The first arc that made me consider dropping One Piece, just because of how long it was, and how little we were progressing in learning, well, anything. This entire arc was about the civil war in Arabasta, and that story alone wasn't interesting to me. Fish-Man Island - I can barely remember anything about this arc, to be honest Dressrosa - Started off really well, Punk Hazard sold us a picture of what it would be like, and how strong Doflamingo is. We met some interesting characters like Senor Pink. But overall it was far, far too long, and the emphasis was most of the time not on the Straw Hats, or the main story. Really enjoyed seeing Law's history with Doflamingo's brother, and it pisses me off that Luffy beat him, Law should 100% of been the person to defeat Doffy. Fujitora was a really cool addition to the arc, and the show as a whole. But yeah, 118 episodes was really hard to get through, when it could have all been said and done if you took out the pointless shit, in less than 50 episodes. Whole Cake Island - Decent start with them travelling around the small islands and running into Pudding, but got boring very quickly with Germa who are lame as all hell, and then the proceeding hunger pangs rubbish where we had to listen to Big Mom saying ""cake"" about 100 times. Absolutely nothing added to the main story through these 95 episodes. We learned about Sanji's upbringing, and that's all. To try and sum it all up as concisely as I can. The biggest problems for me is firstly Luffy as the main character, he never changes, he always has to be the one to beat the bad guy, so I have to watch his overrated boring fights, and he never really seems to think. Secondly, that they overemphasise on side characters or mini-stories that won't effect the main story, or main characters in any meaningful way. Later on in the anime they need to stop introducing more and more new characters, we have tonnes already that are cool and interesting, use them more. No arcs in my opinion should ever go over 100 episodes long. Naruto managed to wrap up the entire Shinobi Fourth War arc in 53 episodes, which is their longest. One Piece needs to stop taking the piss by having multiple arcs run over 50 episodes. For anyone who's read this entire thing, I hope you enjoyed it, and if you didn't and think most of this was a bunch of shit with a few nuggets of truth, then you truly know my feeling towards One Piece!",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 20, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_27d3a516b6,11
"To tell you my truth all i can say is this is the kind of anime that takes its time to tell you the story, it really wants you to understand whats going on and not miss any detail of whats going on. One of the main characters is luffy he is the kind of person who enjoys almost everything and is laid back but somehow is really serious and if one of his friends get in danger he will risk it all to save them. All the characters get there time to shine too and they all get stronger over the story's time line that is really the best thing of this anime i enjoy.

"to start off this review, I can't belive i actullay wasted time watching this garbage to see if it can live up to the praise it gets. well I can definitely say that it really doesnt. i couldve been watcing sao or just any other generic isekai instead of this crap shounen. i might be writing this when im tired but i can easily say that it doesnt affect the review too much. story: the story is god awful. its just jack sparrow if he snorted some eraser bits when he was born and then went on an adventure where he expands his arms or whatever lol. They travel with boat while beating oversized steroid abusers and big boobed women. art: the art is really ugly tbh compared to most anime. The character designs are way too simple unlike in most anime I've watched and they just look stupid. They don't even really look like pirates and it looks like Zoro discovered anime during teen years and bought too many fake katanas. Nami's only good trait is the boobs, but theyre a bit too big too. sound: sound: decent music I guess. the sound effects feel kind of unfitting and dumb if you ask me. characters: boring, just simply boring. Luffy wants to find some stupid one piece, like go find two piece instead. other characters were so boring im not gonna even write about them. enjoyment: almost none tbh. It's best I don't try continuing the show because it feels like it'll just stay the same the entire time.

"Here is my review of One Piece. One Piece are maybe the best shounen series available at the moment since it has almost everything, so it’s a must watch anime. Story One Piece is about a pirate named Monkey D Luffy he is going to the Pirate king and find One Piece the greatest treasure of them all. On his way Luffy are going to gather some pirates some of them are: Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji, But the way to the Grand line is though they must fight against the marine, some mermaids, Shichibukai also known as the seven warlords. Art Since the anime started in 98 the animation was kind of bad, but I got used to it, and the animation get’s a lot better over the years. It’s now released in 720p. Sound I like the voice cast all the main characters has some cool and kawaii voices, if you don’t liked them you will get used to it and like them prolly. Please don’t watch the dubbed version since it sucks. I simply love the BGM in this anime it’s good. The openings are okey, nothing special the same with the endings. Character All the characters in One Piece are loveable since they have a unique personality that you will like and cherish. You will get to know every character well since it will tell you about their past while you watch the series. Enjoyment In the start there is a lot of information about the Grand Line and the treasure One Piece. In episode 30 or something like that the anime is amazing and after that you can’t stop watch it since it so good I liked it very much. Overall One Piece is maybe the most popular anime in the whole world expect of Pokèmon though, so One Piece is fairly good anime. I guess many users here on MAL started to watch One Piece so I will say One Piece is a good starting anime for all new people who have not seen much anime.

"I have been watching this anime and reading manga for over a year. It has only gotten better. Although I enjoy the anime, I recommend folks to read the manga, which is the original work of the writer, and please dont watch the dubbed English version of this animation, they have done a crappy job and the emotions, the feel, its all wrong in dubbed version. Best story, with careful and in depth development of all characters, funny as hell, good action and great quality of art, one of my favorite animes of all times, and anime writer is going for 1k episodes, so be patient, and stay addicted like I am :)",10,Recommended,"Nov 24, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7c37418e64,11
"After years of brushing it off, I decided to finally marathon the show about a month ago, and well, it’s not half bad if I’m being honest. Positives: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a setting as big and explored as the world of One Piece in any other anime before (And I’m guessing this is why it’s so popular too). It’s so imaginative and vibrant, so much effort is put into explaining how the setting works in terms of geography, history, factions, religion, government, lore, etc. Everything in the universe links together and many plot threads are consistently carried over and tied into future story arcs, to the point where I would never believe you if you don’t told me he was making it up as he went. The whole cast of characters all have unique character designs and distinct personalities. The main cast is quite fleshed out; you learn almost every detail about them, and their views and priorities slowly change over the course of the series. Same can be said for most side characters, and to some degree, they receive more character development than the main cast. The soundtrack is great and really matches the tone of the series (My favorite being “Overtaken” and the “Stone Storage Room”) and also compliments the scenes (The scene “Walk to Arlong Park” comes to mind). Negatives: Animation; the quality is just not good. It was decent at the start but gradually got worse as the series went on and really hit rock bottom after the timeskip (It looked like I was watching a slide show). It’s repetitive, some story arcs follow this structure of Go to new island->Residents have a dilemma->Fight & beat villain->Go to new island->Res… Pacing; this is why I will be dropping the series at this point, and will be switching to the manga (Eventually). IT’S SO SLOW. The pacing, just like the animation, was decent at the start but gradually got slower to the point where it felt like almost nothing was happening for 23 minutes. I even had to visit the wiki to find out that some story arcs are actually longer in the anime than the manga, and this is without filler, meaning that they adapt less a chapter per episode, just, no. Overall, it has its faults but it’s a fine shonen (At least until the timeskip where the animation severely declines), and this is what I would ultimately consider to be THE adventure shonen.",7,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0ff13147a3,11
"I despised One Piece years ago, I would flick through channels to see what was on, and see an absolutely unappealing show, that upon the sight & sound I cringe in hate. This would carry with me in my mindset when I started to get into anime, and see as one of the most popular shows being that trash called One Piece (of shit). I didn't think twice about ever watching it, until a little word from a friend saying to watch it & it was apparently good, but I lashed back saying it was terrible. A guy who can stretch, REALLY??? Please. It was until that I had heard that there was a another English dub, and it peaked my interest, as well as seeing screenshots comparing the 4kids version to this new Funimation version, and I saw a bloody, more mature version to the childish crap I saw when I was younger. I was intrigued & intent to view this new take on the show, and after my brother receiving about 8 DVDs of the Funimation version of One Piece, we started on what would I now call my favourite anime so far. The story revolves around the golden age of pirates, which begins after the execution of the legendary pirate named Gold D. Roger (aka Gold Roger), who after conquering the Grand Line - and the only person to do so, is named the King of the Pirates. Moments before his execution, he exclaims that the legendary treasure he attained from his adventure - The One Piece, is out in the Grand Line for anyone to claim, and to venture out and search for it themselves. This sparks the dawn of the golden age of pirates, with thousands of men setting sail to attain the legendary treasure. 22 years later a young man named Monkey D. Luffy mysteriously appears with the goal of becoming the King of the Pirates. Having eaten a devil fruit - a mysterious fruit that causes anyone who eats it to gain a strange & powerful ability, while sacrificing their ability to swim. Luffy is a rubber man, and makes a name for himself in every town he ventures through. Living through this dream he travels town after town, gathering crew members and spurring notoriety. This is truly the definition of an adventure, the scale of the world & the journey they go through, the heartships, the pain, the strength they attain, the character growth, the size of the journey in general, its huge, and with it planning to go on for another 10 years, Im happy to know that there is gunna be plenty of One Piece to go :) Some people see the length of the series being so far 600+ episodes long, and be absolutely daunted and hesitant to watch it. The thing they dont see is that if they watch it, and if they love it, that there is so much there for them to watch & enjoy. This is really a case of the saying that looks can be deceiving. A wacky art style, a boy pirate made of rubber, 600+ episodes long and not ending for another 10 years! But for those who have seen as much as I have (600+ episodes) you can understand why I am so hyped about this anime, and for those who haven't, I hope this can get you to have a little idea and perhaps see it for yourselves and join Luffy & the straw hat pirates on this amazing adventure :) Speaking of the straw hat, it was given to Luffy by a pirate called Shanks, and the thing with Shanks is, along with many of the other characters in this series is that they are so incredibly badass & awesome XD You meet these characters at the very start, and just wait in anticipation to seeing them again after the crazy stuff Luffy & his crew endure, only to see them even more incredibly badass than before, and its such an incredible feeling & experience. The character growth in this is magnificent too, the straw hat even has a deep backstory!! :P Every time you meet another crew member, you see their past, which most of the time is an absolute tear jerker, and gets you attached to that character, and before you know it, your attached to everyone in the crew, and they grow on you. They go through unbelievably absurd obstacles & struggles, face the most powerful foes there is, face death, and manage to prevail if it means defeating the foe, or losing and building up their strength. You are essentially a part of Luffy's crew, and when they go through heartache, you break down along with them, when they prevail, its the best feeling ever. When One Piece eventually hooks you in, and eventually convinces you to becomes one of the crew members, your in for one hell of a journey. And It isn't going to end anytime soon, so you'll have plenty of crazy places to run into, awesome characters to face, and the absolutely ridiculous Luffy causes chaos wherever he may be :P And eventually wait for the day where he will, in fact, become the King of the Pirates. And what a wonderful day that will be :D",10,Recommended,"Aug 20, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bcd07e665e,11

"Sorry, I can't let the nostalgia blind me. One Piece is an absolute mess and the epitome of shōnen brain rot. I've never seen a series that fails on so many levels. It's just so bad, and not only is it just bad; it's one of the largest media franchises in history. How? One Piece has nothing going for it. The power of friendship and vague idealism are the most anyone will ever derive from its story and characters. I mean, really, there's nothing there. There's absolutely nothing about One Piece that even attempts to be good. Luffy is like Eren Jaeger if you stripped him of character development and motivation, because One Piece actually doesn't know what those words mean. One Piece has a thousand episodes to create something of worth, and it still somehow fails. It's bland even by shōnen standards. One Piece, the basic bitch amongst a crowd of basic bitches. The greatest section of the story is actually Enies Lobby, because it contains about three good episodes. Of course, those three good episodes are the only ones in the entire show, but at least it's something. Well, surely there are at least a few decent characters, right? Wrong. Despite having one of the most unnecessarily large casts in all of fiction, not a single one of them is actually well-written. Despite how much it tries, the dialogue in One Piece is utterly appalling, and devoid of subtlety, humanity, and meaning. I would question Oda's own humanity in turn, but considering he's a fifty-year-old man who has published drawings of sexualized children for two decades and suckles upon the gonads of Nobuhiro Watsuki, I think we can already infer that he's been lacking in it. The villains of One Piece are the most pathetic and sloppily written I've ever seen. Utilizing the tropiest of tropes to fool the dopiest of dopes, One Piece has fluked itself into fictional super-stardom with it's cast of truly memorable villains. Hody Jones, the traumatized fish. Doflamingo, the traumatized flamingo. Big Mom, the traumatized... woman? Well, with how Oda depicts women in general within One Piece, I don't think this pattern is quite surprising. Oda has never seen a woman before, which is why he projects his sexual fetishes onto scantily clad girls whose only character traits consist of offensively large booba and badonkadonk. ""Oh, but the world-building is so good!"" Is it, or does it just cram endless loads of irrelevant fluff into a thousand episodes? The only thing that any of the world-building contributes to—is the same boring and poorly executed theme of 'freedom' that haphazardly and opaquely permeates throughout the entire series. It's not impressive, it's not genius, it sucks, just like everything else. Creating an only somewhat detailed world within 1000+ episodes, one which only has detail for the sake of it, is garbage writing. The animation is awful throughout nearly the entire show. For the first couple hundred episodes... it's just appalling. The art gradually improves until the end of Sabaody, at which point it experiences a steady downward trajectory straight into the pits of hell. Then, after about six hundred more episodes of absolute disgrace, it gets decent for the first time. Wow, how wonderful. Keep in mind, this is purely Oda's fault. Trashy and generic panelling, drawing, and writing will naturally result in trashy and generic cinematography and animation. From an aural standpoint, One Piece is honestly quite strong, and the only thing holding it back is sheer repetition. If it were eight hundred or so episodes shorter, it would have one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Unfortunately, just like most aspects of the series, this is ruined by sheer longevity. One Piece isn't good. Even if it were only 12 episodes long, it still wouldn't be good. Unfortunately, it overstays its unwelcome to a truly unprecedented degree. One Piece is the worst anime of all time, and I'm serious. Skelter Heaven is less insultingly shit by a wide margin. Fruit of Evolution is better. Yes, even Code Geass and Steins:Gate are better.

Oda's ability to connect past events with current developments keeps the story fresh and engaging. Characters (10/10): The Straw Hat crew is the heart of the series. Every member has a distinct personality, backstory, and goal, making them relatable and lovable. The villains, too, are multifaceted, often challenging our notions of morality. Animation (8/10): While the early episodes may not boast the most polished animation, Toei Animation's efforts evolve significantly over time. Modern arcs deliver stunning visuals, especially during intense battles. Sound (9/10): From its iconic opening themes to the emotional background scores, the music perfectly complements the series' tone. Voice acting is exceptional, bringing each character's personality to life. Enjoyment (10/10): Few series can match the excitement, humor, and emotional depth of One Piece. It balances epic battles with heartfelt moments, leaving a lasting impression with every episode.

"Started watching this piece of art in 2010, almost 15 years following Oda-sensei, and he never failed to amuse me. I was a teen adult when i started watching/reading and found parts of my life in this story back then. Now at 34 years of age, still i find myself watching/reading it, thinking how real some characters are to me, observing the way i look at them changed as i aged. Though it is not for everyone. I understand people who doesn't like it as I watch it with my husband occasionally and he doesn't like the slow pacing, waiting for the side characters/stories to blend into the main plot etc. This is not a main character, going after his dreams and fighting his way towards his goal type of story. If that is what you are looking for, than this series is not for you. This is about sailing in the vast seas, meeting new people, listening to their stories, eating delicious food, wearing fancy clothes, making friends and enemies in every island, exploring every island with a childish excitement, and finally moving on to next adventure.

Even whole cake island has a slower pacing but it is better than punk hazard. Even though punk hazard and dressrosa has a good plot i have not enjoyed it as i enjoyed the pre time skip arcs due its slow pacing 2)FIGHTS(6/10): About fights, people says one piece has some of the best fights, yes it has but most of the fight scenes were boring. the main character luffy just recklessly attacks the villians without any plan or strategy which makes the fight less enjoyable fighting techniques of some side characters were unique and good marineford has the best fights in one piece even though the arc is full of fights it is the best arc in one piece so far fights at post time skip arcs are too long the fight between luffy and a villian last for more than 10 episodes where nearly for 8 episodes luffy uses the same moves which is boring and at the last 2 two episodes he finds a new moves to defeat the villian over all except few fights all other fights in the anime were average 3)THE MAJOR CONS OF THE ANIME IS PLOT ARMOR THE main character luffy is saved from different villians by an unexpected miracle which is not reasonable.

"I have strong and weak feelings about One Piece, the beloved anime that has won the hearts of millions. It's a cherished classic that has given people endless hours of entertainment, but it also has certain drawbacks. Let's evaluate this based on the following: Pacing - 5/10 Pacing in One Piece is a hotly debated subject. While some storylines have a perfect combination of action, character growth, and plot development, others can seem excruciatingly slow. Particularly in anime, there is a notable quantity of filler material and protracted combat, which can be annoying for viewers who want to see the plot advance. Animation - 7.5/10 Over the years, One Piece's animation has experienced both highs and lows. The animation quality is obviously inconsistent, despite the fact that the visual style is distinctive and has a certain appeal. While certain episodes and storylines stand out for their amazing action sequences and exquisitely detailed locations, others suffer from glaring animation flaws. Given the epic scope of the plot, the usage of still frames during pivotal times can be frustrating (the animation improves after a few episodes, and the current arc is at its best at this point). Story-telling - 9/10 Unquestionably, the strength of Eiichiro Oda's storytelling is One Piece's crowning achievement. His world-building, deft plotting, and feeling of adventure that he infuses into each episode are simply amazing. The main plot of the story, the hunt for the One Piece treasure, keeps you interested and anxious to explore the next island. A tribute to Oda's brilliance is the richness of the world's lore and the ties between characters. Character Development - 8/10 One Piece features a sizable and varied ensemble of characters, each with their own distinctive traits and goals. Character development is effectively done, especially for the key crew members. It's satisfying to see them change and advance throughout the series. The lack of development for some characters who are not part of the main cast can be felt. Undoubtedly, the anime and manga industries have been forever changed by the success of the series. Its strong points include grandiose world-building, engrossing storytelling, and memorable characters. Fans may find the variable animation quality and occasionally slow pacing annoying. One Piece is still a cherished and renowned series that is still praised for its enduring spirit of adventure in spite of its imperfections. Ultimately, my conflicted sentiments towards this are a result of my passion for the show and want to see it continuously achieve its potential. Although the voyage is worthwhile, there may be a few hiccups along the road.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 28, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ffceab8997,11
"This anime is truly incredible. What does it mean to be able to make a movie even for the side characters of an anime? Its story is full of mysteries. Although the power system is not very good, it is sufficient. I loved the sense of friendship and their more realistic approach. There is a ""hero"" in every anime now, I don't like this and I don't think the hero is something realistic. Even though Luffy is going to do a really good favor in this regard, he gets rewarded and is uncomfortable with being called a hero. There are so many good things in this anime, too many to count them, but the only bad thing is that the animation scene is prolonged. People who want to watch from the original source 400 episodes! I watch it a lot and for no reason, I'm one of them.",8,Recommended,"Jul 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2c6cdd4c21,11
"The most popular anime to have ever existed. In a lockdown, with nothing to do, I took on the daunting task of completing the biggest and most popular anime to have ever existed. I wish I didn't. Let's start with the positives: 1) The World Building: Arguably the best pro of this series is how huge this world really is. When you start getting to know the world it already seems huge but then many new elements are introduced that keep making the world bigger and better and they fit perfectly. 2) The Characters: This was my favorite part of this series. Every character, doesn't matter if they were main or side, had great back story, motivations, and conclusions. 3) Adventure: One piece is the definition of adventure. It embodies it like no other anime has or ever will. Now the negatives: 1) Humor: In my opinion this was pathetic. Childish humor that never made me laugh. The humor was always the same: Luffy being an air-head; Sanji falling for a girl even if he has to fight her and then refusing to fight her cause chivalry; Usoop being a cry-baby. 2) The Non-existent motive to move forward: One piece is forgotten. I genuinely think the crew if stupid enough to have forgotten their reason for setting out on this journey: One Piece (Even though every character has their own agenda too, the main agenda that the viewer cares about is still One Piece). Just saying ""future pirate king"" isn't going to make Luffy the pirate king. 3) Repetitive Story: You Go to an island - Island being a paradise - turns out it is not - help the people - fight the mini-boss at the end - lose - get a power-up - win and have a party - go to the next island. 4) Goofing off: Luffy or Zoro or Sanji have to get stuck somewhere (the only 3 useful people in a fight) cause of an insultingly stupid reason like having a hunting competition, sleeping, going shopping getting stuck in a building or running in the wrong direction just to get rescued by Nami, getting punched in the head and yelled at, then saving the day. 5)OP: People getting power-ups just because they can. Zoro was slashed with a proper sword after already being beaten up and then thrown into a wall suddenly awakens a power and defeats the villain. I bet people wouldn't even be able to figure out which arc I am talking about cause it happens IN EVERY ARC. 6)Plot armor: No one dies. Not even the side characters. People getting shocked by millions of volts are just charred and then they make a joke about being fried rather than dying (btw humans die from 100-250V). Every shounen has plot armor, there is no getting around that, but the fact that it is just being slammed into your face every 5 episodes is just insulting. 7)Villains: Every Villian is pathetic. Facts. 8) Too many fights at the same time. In every arc the group is split up so there are multiple fights that are going on simultaneously. There are times I had forgotten a fight was even happening cause it wasn't even mentioned in the next 1 or 2 episodes. Yet there are still more cons that I can talk about. Oda has made an absolutely stunning world don't get me wrong. It is very satisfying when plot points that are hinted at hundreds of episodes before are paid off but you can't possibly say that this anime is good, let alone great, just on the basis of world-building and character backstory (not development because there is none). Frankly I possibly don't like this cause I have jumped on this bandwagon far too late. I know for a fact I would have liked this show when I was a kid and nostalgia would have done the rest. If anyone wants to jump on this, only do so if you have an ungodly amount of spare time on your hand (which you probably shouldn't and should use it more productively unlike me).",3,Not Recommended,"May 24, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_acfa5f7b32,12
"The great One Piece! One Piece for me was a relationship of love and obligation at first, I felt that as an otaku I was obliged to watch this work because it is the biggest Shounen in terms of episodes and it is also one of the most famous. When I started watching it, I watched it very quickly, I couldn't get much of an attachment to the openings and endings because of that (with the exception of ""We Are""), I watched One Piece in just a month and a half while the episodes of the Whole Cake arc were released. At first I simply wanted to finish it quickly and add it to my list of completed animes, but over time I started to like it until I reached a point where I fell in love with the work, the characters are very charismatic, the universe is rich and full of connections between them, the work brings many concepts, many reflections and many dilemmas (I remember these things happening more before the time-skip). The characters are very, very well developed. As an example, I would like to mention my favorite character in the series, which is without a doubt Ace. First, Ace was the reason Luffy wanted to go to sea and after that he became a character completely independent of Luffy. Even though Luffy is the protagonist, I believe that everyone who watched One Piece watched an anime just about Ace and his adventures, and that is exactly the point. A character who can stand alone in a series is not that rare, but several characters in a series is very rare. I can mention other examples such as Sabo, Roger, Xebec, Garp, Whitebeard, and others. However, it is worth mentioning something: when I got to the Whole Cake arc, that was when I really felt the problem with the work. As I said in my review of One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen, I repeat here: One Piece is incredible. What is wrong with it is the fact that the work is very, very dragged out. Out of 24 minutes of each episode, only 14/16 minutes are of new stuff. This annoys anyone over time and drives new fans away from consuming the work, since it would already be long even without these things. Even with these problems, One Piece continues to be one of my favorite works because of the care and development that the author has with the work. I continue to give it a solid 9. =================================================================================================================Versão em Português===================================== O grandioso One Piece! One Piece pra mim foi uma relação de amor e obrigação no inicio, senti que como otaku era obrigado a ver essa obra pois é o maior Shounen em questão de episódios e tambem é um dos mais famosos. Quando comecei a assistir eu assisti muito rapido, não consegui pegar muito apego pelas aberturas e pelas ending por causa disso (com exceção de ""We Are""), assisti One Piece em apenas um mês e meio enquanto lançava os episódios do arco de Whole Cake. No começo simplesmente queria acabar logo e colocar na minha lista de animes concluídos mas com o tempo fui pegando gosto até chegar em um ponto que me apaixonei pela obra, os personagens são muito carismáticos, o universo é rico e cheio de ligações entre si, a obra traz muitos conceitos, muitas reflexões e muitos dilemas (lembro dessas coisas ocorrerem mais pré time-skip). Os personagens são muito mas muito bem desenvolvidos, como exemplo queria citar o meu personagem favorito da obra que sem sombra de duvidas é o Ace, primeiro, Ace foi o motivo de Luffy querer ir ao mar e depois disso ele se tornou um personagem completamente independe do Luffy, mesmo que o Luffy seja o protagonista, creio que todos que assistiram One Piece assistiram um anime só do Ace e suas aventuras e é exatamente esse o ponto, um personagem que consegue se manter sozinho em uma obra não é tão raro, mas diversos personagens em uma obra é muito raro, posso citar outros exemplos como o Sabo, Roger, Xebec, Garp, Barba Branca e entre outros. Porem vale citar algo, quando cheguei no arco de Whole Cake foi ai que senti de fato o problema da obra, como falei na minha review de One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen repito aqui, One Piece é incrível, o que peca nele é o fato da obra ser muito mas muito arrastada, de 24 minutos de episodio, somente 14/16 minutos são de coisas novas, isso chateia qualquer um ao longo do tempo e afasta novos fãs a consumir a obra visto que ela já seria longa mesmo sem essas coisas. Mesmo com esses problemas, One Piece continua sendo um das minhas obras favoritas pelo carinho e pelo desenvolvimento que o autor possui com a obra.

"Too much enthusiasm for just another shonen. “You're going to love it eventually"", that has a name: Stockholm Syndrome. And yes, I've already been told it has a great plot and complex characters and a consistent story and great world building... but, there are so many great anime doing the same or even a better job in fewer episodes. I don't need nor want to get involved in such a long story with the usual shonen clichés only to find out at the end that the mangaka just doesn't know how to end his story.

"This is the first review I have ever written, or even plan to write, so give me a break. To sum up ""One Piece"" in a single word, I would have to say AMAZING. Everything about it represents why I love watching anime. The fact that I am still watching it now after 550 episodes, and still wanting more is enough to show just how great it is. The only negative aspect about the show is also a good thing. There a simply a TON of episodes. In order to start one piece you need to be willing to dedicate days of time towards it. But if you love One Piece, like I do, then the fact that there are so many episodes is actually the best part about it! Im not the type of person to go in depth about things, so I will keep this brief. One Piece offers a simple, yet genius story. Has an amazing cast of characters. Has a variety of different elements, including comedy, action, adventures, tear-jerking scenes, and even a little romance. AND WHO DOESN""T LOVE PIRATES? COME ON! Combine all these things and then some, and you get my favorite anime of all time. For those of you who are willing to spend a lot of time on an anime, WATCH ONE PIECE! You wont regret it.",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a0b9c54347,12
"One Piece is an anime frequently classified with Bleach and Naruto as one of the ""Big 3"" in anime and manga. These 3 have ruled at the top in terms of popularity for over a decade, and their popularity is still high as ever, if not higher. I personally find it really hard to get into long-running animes (+100) but surprisingly, One Piece was an exception, a rare one at that. One Piece was one of my first anime I've watched. (first being pokemon ofc) It was the anime that got me into anime, especially when there was a time where I thought anime was boring and a waste of time. I literally thought that they didn't have anything special about it. However, after getting a recommendation from my brother, One Piece really changed my views on anime. Since I barely knew about anime at that time, I was really intrigued by the aspect of pirates and adventure. I watched one episode, then another, and another... and I was hooked to the show in no time at all. Because I was impressed by One Piece, I started watching other shows, mostly of the similar genre. From then, my love for anime has grew and grew, and is still growing to this day and it's all thanks to one great piece of anime. One Piece takes place during the Great Age of Pirates, which started when the King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger announced to the world shortly before his death that he had hidden his greatest treasure, the ""One Piece"" somewhere, and told others to find it. About 20 years later, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gomu Gomu no mi devil fruit, also interested in finding the One Piece and exploring the world, sets out on a journey full of exciting adventures, dangerous pirates and marines, and meeting new friends. From there, he makes many new comrades to support his journey. The story itself seems nothing special, but it evolves as the time goes on. At the time of writing this review, One Piece is at 670 episodes, which might tell you that it is rather drawn out. However, during those 670 episodes, they slowly build the world and characters into something unique and huge, enhancing the story bit by bit. The story arcs are fantastic and well thought out, sometimes leaving you in awe. In the story arcs, you are usually introduced to other minor characters, some who are equally interesting to watch just as the main characters. And the fights as a whole, are really well paced and entertaining, mixing blends of action, humor, and drama to keep you hooked. Also, like most other long running anime, One Piece does have its share of fillers. BUT, they have nowhere near an overwhelming amount of fillers and some fillers can even be enjoyable as well. The fillers also introduce you to new characters, who although non-canon, are still pretty likable as well. Like many other animes, One Piece also has a system of supernatural powers. In the world of One Piece, there are things known as Devil Fruits, which essentially take the shape of real-life fruits, but taste horrible and give consumers a unique power. Depending on the user and how they use it, the Devil Fruit can become something very powerful. The concept of the Devil Fruit is one of the most impressive aspects of One Piece. There are three types of known Devil Fruit: Paramecia, which gives you the ability of superhuman ability or traits, Zoan which lets you transform into an animal, and finally Logia, which can transform your body into an element like fire or ice. The idea of eating something and getting superpowers is nothing new, but the fact that One Piece has shown an immense amount of Devil Fruits already, and that no two fruits are ever the same, is quite impressive. Oda really exercised his creativity level on this part, as while some abilities might come off as goofy, you cannot deny the creativity and work Oda put into some of the fruits and their users. For the Art... now this is the section I've heard the MOST complaints about. To be honest, I was bit skeptical myself when I first saw the art style. It can come off as cartoonish, childish drawing for the most parts, possibly turning off viewers. However, as I watched on and on, I forgot about it. After a couple of episodes, I honestly didn't CARE for how the art looked, as I was just immensely enjoying the hell out of the show. It's really a hit or miss however, as it can turn many people off completely, while others might not be bothered by it so much. Also, nowadays, the art in One Piece has improved dramatically. It is much more pleasing to the eye than it ever was. The artwork is fresh and clean. The character designs are also outstanding as well. Some might be drawn rather silly, but the uniqueness in some of the character art is very fun to look at. Now, I've heard some people say that the soundtracks are rather silly and lame. This really depends on your tastes in music, but I personally found most of the soundtracks amazing. While some of them do come off as silly, the osts all fit the scene and atmosphere very well. The voice acting is also equally impressive, with each of the voice actors fitting their characters perfectly, and also being able to deliver emotion, or intensity depending on the scene. The characters in the Straw Hat Pirates are special. Not really because they will be the most unique characters you'll ever see, but because of the bond they share with each other. The characters are very well developed, have interesting/fun personalities, and most importantly, they are easy to love. They all have interesting backgrounds, some which are tragic, and are striving to achieve their dreams as they adventure together. As they travel along, they start to care for each other so deeply to the point where they would do anything to protect each other, creating extremely powerful and emotional episodes or arcs at some point. The Straw Hat crew members are exceptionally great, but the supporting characters themselves are no slouch either. Most of them are designed well and have unique, interesting personalities. Unlike many anime, they aren't just pushed to the side, no. Most of them have interesting, yet traguc backgrounds and goals, and you can't help but cheer for them as they try to achieve their own goals. Some even are just as lovable as the main characters themselves! Hell, I even cheered for some of the antagonists at one point as well, as they were just too likable and unique. One Piece is an amazing anime. Although not perfect, it still is one of the most fun and entertaining experience I've ever had. I know many people who won't even give One Piece a chance for couple of reasons. Most are turned away by the art, some are discouraged because of the episode count, and some are even victims of the infamous 4kids dub (which was HORRIBLE btw). Well, I can't force people to watch it, but I really think everyone should give One Piece at least a chance. In one anime, you'll be taken through a journey full of adventure, good action, comedy, and drama. Who knows? You could enjoy the hell out of this show, and possibly forget about every downsides I mentioned above. I sure did, and maybe you could as well, if you just give it a try.",9,Recommended,"Aug 26, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cbb25d39a0,12
"Man, where do I start with one piece. This anime is my number one overall and that will never change. The reasoning behind that is just the love I have for one piece.

I've been watching it for 10 years and still counting! The story is amazing along with the characters. The soundtrack is also great. I know the animation isn't on ufotable's or Madhouse's level but it's good when it needs to be and that's fine.

"I make this clear. I'm not a fanboy who only seen this serie and proclaims that it is the best thing in the world. I saw so many anime and I truly think that One Piece is ONE of the best anime/manga of all Time. The plot is incredible and the cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in anime and the seiyuu who play them fit perfectly into it. Luffy and his friends makes you cry like a bitch and laugh like a cow and THAT'S the awesomeness of One Piece. I had goose bumps when Robin says "" I WANNA LIVE "". I cried for Ace in MarineFord. I was laughing out loud when Zorro get Lost. (9999 times) I was pissed of when Kuma detroyed the "" Mugiwara "" ! The Storyline is so complex that characters are only growing up and make them more Interesting and it's clever from Oda to enlarge the univers of One Piece before developing a Character. That's why One Piece is awesome. It makes you feel full of emotion and not many anime do the same.

"One Piece is and will always be one of my favorite anime shows, however there are some things that could have been better. Story: 9 The story of One Piece started out pretty simple. Become the king of the pirates. In a way, to me this is similar to Naruto's goal of becoming Hokage. We all know its going to happen, we just don't know how. In order to reach this simple goal, many smaller goals take place. This includes finding a ship, gaining crew members, crossing the grand line, and finding the pirate king's treasure and each of these smaller goals contain more objectives within. It's these simpler objectives that makes the main goal of the story better. The reason why this is not a 10 is because the story is sometimes repetitive. For example, each time a new crew member is introduced it goes like this; New member introduced, member in some kind of trouble, main character helps new member, new member becomes official. This happens EVERY time. Although its predictable, this is still enjoyable because we get to see the process of how it happens. Art: 7 You've probably already heard the artwork sucks. To me this is not the case. Yeah, in the first couple of arcs the artwork could have been better, but they were never terrible. Keep in mind the show was out for 15 years. As time progressed, so did the artwork. Now, I'd say the art is actually pretty good. Not the best, but not bad either. Sound: 10 I don't have much to say about the sound. The music fits the theme of the show and makes it that much better. Character: 9 The character development is great! Throughout the show, the viewers grow closer to each of the characters. I'm not an emotional person, however there were a couple of times where because I was so attached to the characters, tears began to form once something bad happened. The only flaw yet again is that it repeats itself. One way that the viewers grow towards the characters is that each time a new one is introduced, there is a flashback of the character as a child showing the hardships they went through. Yes, this is a good way to help the audience relate to the character, but to do this every time starts to take away from the show a little. Enjoyment: 10 As mentioned before, this will always be one of my favorites. The show has everything I enjoy. The action scenes are exciting, the story keeps me interested, just the right amount of comedy without going over the top, emotional moments, and the perfect amount of fan service ( after time skip it gets heavier, but I don't mind ). I enjoyed this show so much I started it last summer, and caught up to the story line within the same summer. Overall: I say overall this anime is a 9 simply because of the repetition, and the number of episodes. The storyline and everything else is amazing, but now a days people are busy and they don't have enough time to catch up on 685 episodes. And to watch all these episodes knowing how the process will take place at times is kind of a drag. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. This is my first anime review ever.

"Okay so this is my first review and let me start off by saying that i wont give a 3 hour summary on one piece. But instead, i will tell you what you will be going through while you watch this anime. When you watch this anime you will laugh, get angry, smile, be pumped up, stressed, frustrated, happy ,cry and so many other emotions that i cant explain. The reason you will be going through this is because when you watch this anime you will grow so attached to each character and how they feel you will feel like they are part of your family. I used to hate this show because i saw a couple of episodes on tv and didnt give it a chance but then by friend told me that if i didnt at least like the anime by episode180 he would give me 20 dollars. So i watched the anime from episode 1 to 180 and fell in love with it but i told my friend i hated it still and got that 20 dollars. But the point is that if you watch at least 180 episodes you will love it. I know most of you are thinking that if it takes 180 episodes to like something is wayyy to long but the reason that is, is because within that time span you will get to know and become friends with the characters. SO I GIVE ANYONE WHO READS THIS THE 180 CHALLENGE!!!!! If you take this challenge you must watch 180 episodes of one piece and if you dont like it by then, you can give yourself 20 dollars!!!!

"One piece tells the story of a young man who sets out the become king of the pirates ina world scattered with so many other pirates. To some, this may not sound interesting, and it didn't sound interesting to me at first either. But deep down One Piece is not a story about pirates. It is a story that takes time to show you and explore it's world with the characters, and go along the journey with them. The development for certain characters is great. The story has to probably make this one of the most political anime ever. It covers racism, corrupt government, and the idea of justice magnificently, and incorporates it into the story exceptionally. If you haven't started it you should.

"STORY: 10 ART: 7 ANIMATION: 6 SOUND: 6 CHARACTERS: 10 ENJOYMENT: 9 OVERALL:9 or 10 (Currently during Post time skip: 7.5) INTRO: I started One Piece because I noticed it was placed pretty high on the TOP anime list here (#38 at the time). And I was just thinking ""WHY? Looks shitty"". Anyway I felt like trying out another long running series at the time cause I was starting to get real bored with the other big shounens, and perhaps the genre itself. ""WTH I'll give it a go"". 6 years later. I don't regret. ONE PIECE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE!!! It does not fall short compared to other battle shounens. I guarantee you. Looks kiddy in regards to the art, and the silliness it dishes out often, but it's no way a show just for kids like pokemon or Yu-gi-oh. Aight? STORY: Our main cast are pirates! They're actually the supposed bad guys here. They are not do-gooders. They just do whatever the hell they want, and sometimes that includes helping people, and kicking the other evil guys' butt. Their enemies and conflicts will arise from other pirates, the marines, and the world Government. The core element is adventure. It's adventure-plot driven. It's starts off with them island hopping, getting entangled in new stories, cultures, kicking the bad guy's ass, but the island hopping isn't all that random. They pertain to the main overarching plot, and to get to the final destination, well they gotta go to some places. In each arc, you'll obtain some piece of information that is relevant to the main story. The further you go in, you'll notice it becomes more and more connected to the overall arching plot. I wanna talk a little bit about the world of One Piece. In terms of world building, OP does more of it and better than most. ODA gave himself lots of leg room to work with yo. OP has this 'don't take me too seriously vibe' which helps us not to criticize it too much for some of the weirder things, yet it still manages to make it quite believable. A few minor things might not make sense, but overall it works. The plot is more complex than what it appears. The plot will grow, conflicts will arise, so many many awesome people you will meet, and even see again. Oda does a great job at seeding things in early on and tying them together later. And there are still many intriguing mysteries that are still yet to be solved even after 700 episodes. The world of One Piece is big, but the best thing is that it all feels connected. ART: Old, weird, fugly art at the beginning. Overtime style evolves a bit, and looks a lot better. I've come to personally love the style, especially the manga art. Gotta let it grow on you. Animation is acceptable-ish overall, later on before time skip it seems to get pretty good! Then after time skip it kinda goes to shit again. CHARACTER: This is the place where OP shines. THE CHARACTERS MAN. MANY ARE UNIQUE (some more than others), WEIRD, QUIRKY, BADASS, AND JUST PLAIN AWESOME. The characters are really something. I end up liking a lot of them, even ones where I initially thought wouldn't amount to anything worthy of attention. Oda gives his little imaginary people, character that you just can't help but end up liking despite how utterly bizarre they look sometimes. And in this grand OP world, you are going to be running into many different people. The OP cast is huge, some are one-dimensional, but many leave an impression on you. ENJOYMENT: PROS: Before I knew it, I end up loving the characters and their interactions with one another. Strong feels. I laugh, shed some manly tears, can really feel the anger of the characters. This show makes me feel lots during their adventures, but mostly this show puts a smile on my face. Good mix of comedy and serious business. Some of my favorite moments are just when the crew's hanging out on their ship, relaxing. Not a lot of fillers compared to other shounens either, and even when there are fillers, it's short, there for comedy sake, and fun to watch. I think the story & writing is really good, not cliche, and keeps me hooked. Unpredictable often, and I'm just sitting back and enjoying the ride. CONS: Might be a rough start for some, slow-paced as fuck at times/drawn out scenes in order to not catch up to the manga, seldom boring ass fodder villains (mostly during the start), excessive booby fan-service recently, can get repetitive, post time skip is starting to feel like your typical boring shounen. There are so many episodes, so of course there will be some boring ones. OVERALL: After all that praising, there will still be people who won't like it at all. It's because we're all fucking different and value different things. There are those who ONLY like watching mature, seinen, deep, intellectual, realistic animes who will find One Piece childish, and just not their thing. Then there are those who are more flexible and can enjoy the above listed and all kinds of other animes, and can appreciate humor, etc etc, AND WOULD STILL assume One Piece to be a trashy children's show just based on first impressions. I'm here to help the latter group of people, (who are able to enjoy a wide variety of anime like cowboy bebop, FMA, DBZ, Naruto, etc all at the same time) to understand that One Piece isn't as childish/retarded as they might initially think, and that they might enjoy it. It's not a kiddy or lame as Pokemon, Yugioh (no hate for these guys btw). One piece has comedy, but also has a serious story, and based on the numbers/facts, many do indeed, find it interesting. So give it a chance if you are on the fence about it. DROP IT if you absolutely HATE the first 150 episodes, BUT STILL BE AWARE that the story does get better and deeper the further you go in. (Isn't it like that for all big shounens?) It's not perfect. Why is it so popular then? Because it's just so damn enjoyable to watch despite some of its' flaws. For whatever reason, it clicked in the right way for a lot of us, and we just can't get enough of it. To be able to enjoy and be entertained. Isn't that all we want from a show? Another thing. I don't know about you guys, but OP feels more badass and less corny(?) to me than most of the other battle shounens. Can't explain it too well. TL;DR // RECOMMENDED FOR: So finally, if you love shounen such as DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, bleach, Gintama, HxH, and/or Hitman Reborn, and haven't tried One Piece, please do come see what the fuss is about. There's a good chance you might enjoy One Piece too. OP is sometimes sillier than some of these other titles and some people really don't have tolerance for that, and would prefer darker vibes like HxH, BUT if you're FLEXIBLE (you like all kinds of anime), give it a chance. TRUST ME, OP DOES NOT FALL SHORT IN TERMS OF STORY & SERIOUSNESS. Please, don't judge a book by its' cover. It is my favorite of the long battle shounens, and the only one of its' kind to have kept me interested this long. This is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of long battle shounens in the first place. If I were to grade the anime a little more fairly, I would give it a 7 or 8 because sometimes the animation quality drops, and also sometimes Toei adds useless scenes, or drags out certain boring scenes, and there are those boring episodes with boring badguys once in awhile. And also some little plot flaws like how a character never dies, etc. But if I were to grade it based on how much I fucking enjoy One Piece, it's story and characters overall, I give it a 10. So overall, anime One Piece gets 9/10 from me. Advice: For the love of God, don't go skipping around arcs. You're not gonna get that build up feel, and connection to the characters, which is important here. If you're gonna dedicate yourself to understanding OP, if you wanna understand why the fans love OP, it's best to watch all the arcs, (minus foxy arc unless you don't mind more comedy). Or better yet, just read the damn manga instead. The manga is perfect, the anime can sometimes be a little horrendous with the dragging and the unnecessary scenes. And again, if you find the first 100 or so episodes TERRIBLY unbearable, it probably isn't your thing.",9,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_41f05e0e65,12
Is it useful to describe One piece? Its just one of the master piece of this kind of manga. At the beginning the art can be difficult to come in. But when your are in the story you can not stop to watch the anime. The story start slowly but everything become definitely more exciting when they come to the great road. It began to love this manga at this moment. If you want to start this anime be patient. At the moment when I write there are around 500 episodes!!!,10,Recommended,"May 22, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b79598c011,12
"Well, i doubt my review will be seen out of hundreds of thers yet i still wanted to talk about the cr*p which i regretted time i wasted on it and warn those who are about to start this veery long series. STORY: One piece is about anything but pirates. First of all keep in mind that it is no where about a deep story. It is all just repetitive arcs of same concept again and again: mc, Luffy, goes to a village, fools around and makes friend with someone there(of course his new friend has a long tragic backstory like everyone else before, nearly 15% of whole one piece is about those sad backstories of characters), some bad guy who responsible for his/her bad days will torment MC's friend again. His new friend will cry and mc will shout angrily ""i gonna beat the f*** of him"". Luffy will lose the first part of the fight, he needs some rest time now. Meanwhile Luffy's each crew members are about the beat their own opponents. After life and death situation Luffy will get some power-up somehow and when he gather all his power in his last punch his oppenent will fall in slow motion with hype music in background. Now all left is his recover from his injuries and then he can celebrate his victory with all people of village. His new friend high probably will join the crew and Luffy will go to next city to repeat all those things. Luckily all those strong guys who could kill MC with his fart won't be there or let him get away. Yep, that's what basicly one piece is. You'll also see some mysterious shadow characters or bigshots at the end of arcs who is affecting direction of main story. As story continues power balance turns to sh*t. Mysterious powers once claimed to be rare now are too common. There are too much plot armors and very rarely someone dies or lose their limbs. No mind blowing turns in story just ""ta ta ta ta ta. power of whatever!"" straight fights. Side characters and minions will wait while others fight(well, can't blame too much since it is hard to animate and direct). Running in city is as long as Tsubasa characters reaching goalkeeper. Also world goverment now has hyperinflation with bounties. Why they even bothering putting those bounties while all they do is feeding them in prison forever instead execute them no matter how dangerous they are or what crimes they commit? To let them escape from prison someday so that they could get their part in story? Also technology will get sudden revolution out of blue but will not be used in fights for no reason. Why even minions of both sides using swords if machine guns and explosives exist now? How come world's power balance remained largely unchanged for dozens of years but with mc's generation everything turned upside down in just 2-3 years? If it was that simple why other power holders didn't try that before? Even pirate king wasn't that fast. They getting power-ups way too fast. I wish they have been aged instead, like 10-20 years, as story continues. I like fantasy stories but once it breaks it's own world building rules it does not makes sense anymore. And biggest problem is pacing that turned to total torture after time skip. If anime catchs manga either go for season break or reduce episode duration from 24 min to 14 min ART: There is the rule thing for shounen mangakas: draw every character as distinguishable just by looking at their shadows. After hundreds of characters Oda lost of ideas, now characters not even look any human anymore! All absurdly big bodies with strange and clown-ish faces, and females sexualised too much with absurd body portions. Nothing impressive about background art neither. CHARACTERS: What made one piece great was it's characters. Especially MC, Luffy, used to be very eccentric character that it is hard to guess what he gonna do next. He was so funny but also mature in some way and my very first reason i was enjoying this series. But now he lost all his charm after time skip arc that his movements feels too blank. Not just him, other character's writing turned mess too. Instead of getting deeper character development(i don't talk about their power levels) now they all have simple predictable blank personalities. All has own some lines with behaviours and just repeating those whenever they appear. Honestly one piece long lost it's atmosphere. Oda's another mistake was he made one of key member of crew, Usopp, as unlikeable weak ugly guy. What even made him think that would be a good idea? What's most irritating thing is that there is no even pirate like pirates in this pirate story except fews in early parts. They are all heroes, challengers, ideologists, weirdos,evil merchants, mafia etc. And there is almost none pirate who has sword. How come this is a pirate show? And later in story Oda makes everyone crying damn too much with snot leaking from their nose in order to make the scene look more impressive and dramatic, but it rather damaging atmasphere more with that absurdity. Mature/realistic acting characters are very few, personalites are straight and don't change a lot. Most of them written as simple absolute bad or absolute good characters. Every new character always has different weird laughing style which becomes annoying later MUSIC: It is nice but that stingy studio still using same soundtracks even after thousand of episodes? Why don't they bother to make new ones while they milking all those money from One Piece. And sound effects that used in fights are really bad SUMMARY: What made One Piece one of the most popular eseries ever is it's never ending hype that audiences have. Maybe that could be the reason that producers never go for season breaks while everyone is complaning about pacing: to not let that hype ever die. I doubt if this hype could contunie otherwise. I stopped around episode 980 and saying ""i'll return after i pile some episedes"", but i never had a single urge to return back in last 3 years. “People all around the world are in search of the greatest treasure ever” has really good potential and something i would want to watch, but One Piece failed it. It could be executed much better. I wish there was more mysterious fantasy stuff of world building ,and tension that make you wonder what'll happen next and if anyone is gonna die or survive. I hope this thing could get a seinen spin-off someday in future with clear of it's plot holes and more realistic characters. A bit hunterxhunter like approach in story building would be nice too In conclude, if you don't value your time and just want to enjoy your day like watching a saturday cartoon go ahead, i throughly enjoyed earlier parts as well. It was funny. But don't expect too much later, you may regret.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 11, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2460fac579,12
"One Peak, absolute cinema. The story and world building of One Piece is amazing. No arc feels boring or out of place. Each arc tells an amazing story of Luffy and his crew fighting against the corruption of the world. The art style is amazing. Personally I enjoy the art style pre-timeskip but the art is still really good, especially the fight scenes. The choreography and overall art of One Piece's fight scenes are unmatched. The characters are super fun too. Luffy is a bright shining star acting as the light that guides the people around him. My personal favorite character is Zoro because of his often serious and stern person, however he has a lot of funny and goofy moments with the crew. I think the main issue people have with one piece is the length and all I have to say to that is that its worth it.",10,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e8c1fd99e5,12
"GrandLineReview, I am calling you out. This is a review mainly focused on the post-time skip era of One Piece in comparison to the pre-time skip. To sum it all up, post-time skip is a shell of its former self. And why is that? Well, it’s because Oda has changed what he is prioritizing. In the pre-time skip days, Oda focused on character development as the top priority, followed by action, and then lastly, world building. The post-time skip One Piece has focused mainly on world building, followed by action, and very far back is character development. What made me – and many others - get into One Piece were the main characters, the Straw Hats. Watching the Straw Hats interact with each other and building their friendships was very entertaining. This is because all of them were likable and interesting characters – well, excluding Franky. Franky was never given a character; other than being the robot guy. Since the time skip, our main characters aren’t really main characters anymore. The only exception is Luffy, who is always front and center. The plot no longer focuses on developing the Straw Hats. Nami and Robin are nothing more than fanservice nowadays; they barely do ANYTHING. Usopp is little more than the prototypical coward, and Chopper is just a mascot now. His monster point transformation, which was once the most fascinating thing about Chopper, has become a joke. Brook is still funny, but he never had as much development as the other characters anyway. The worst thing for Brook is that he joined too late in the series when One Piece was already getting more “kooky” and “zany”, meaning that any possible character focus he could’ve gotten had he shown up earlier is now a pipe-dream. Zoro does have cool moments and fights, but he been pushed aside by other characters like Law; who take on the role of second-in-command for long stretches at a time. And then there is Franky, who is a robot. This all leads us to Sanji. My god, Sanji, what have they done to you? After being chased by trans people for two years, he’s then given the laughable story arc of almost dying constantly because he gets noise bleeds from seeing girls. Fucking girls. Yes, he was like always like Brock from Pokemon, but after the time skip he is LITERALLY pushed to death’s door from seeing women! Also, Sanji has been getting his ass kicked in 1-one-1fights to everyone. “Hold on!” You must be saying, “Sanji got his own arc, right?” Yes, you are right, because after destroying a beloved character and turning him into a joke, you kind of need to find a way to fix him so the fans don’t rage. Enter the Whole Cake Island story, where Sanji redeems himself by: getting his ass kicked by his father, baking a cake, and getting a ridiculous Power Rangers suit. In short, he doesn’t do anything. They do touch on his childhood, but it’s pointless anyway, because all we find out is that he wants to be a cook, and that he had a shitty life as a child. Sanji, as a character, doesn’t change from beginning to end throughout the Whole Cake Island arc. Bafflingly, it is Luffy who develops far more in Sanji’s own arc. At some point, Sanji has his hero’s journey hijacked, and it ends up being Luffy who transforms and receives the gifts of goodness. Do I think Oda hates Sanji and the Straw Hats? No! That’s a really foolish conclusion to come to. Likewise, it would be just as foolish to believe these low quality character arcs indicate that Oda likes Sanji (wow, GrandLineReview). Only an idiot would present the false dichotomy that Oda either loves or hates Sanji. The actual answer is that he just doesn’t care about him – or the other Straw Hats - as much as he cares about world building. World building has become the main driver in this series. To understand how, I will split up world building into two categories: first is the design of characters and the world at large, and the second category is the actual characters in the world. In regards to the first category, the different locations the straw-hats go to after the time skip are certainly crazy. Each new place seems to top the last, but none of them are bad. The character designs, on the other hand, are just ridiculous now. While it is true that the people in One Piece always looked goofy, Oda has turned it up the silliness to eleven. These are just nitpicks, however. For the second category, we come to the main problem with world building: the side characters in every location that get pushed to main character status. This is a very bad situation, because it means that in each new story arc, you will have Luffy, and at least one other side character that gets the focus, major character moments, and development. It happens in every arc: in Fishmen Island, it is Luffy, Jinbe, and Shirahoshi; in Punk Hazard: it’s Luffy, Law, Smoker, Momonosuke, and Kinemon; in Dressrosa, we have Luffy, Rebeca, Law, Bellamy, Sabo, Kyros; and now in Wano, there’s Luffy and every side-character (way too many to count). Wano is somewhat better, because Zoro is being focussed on too - which is a breath of fresh air, but doesn’t change the point being made here. Even in Whole Cake Island, we have characters like Pedro who get better moments than Sanji – who is the guy that the arc is supposed to be about. Now, I am not saying the development these characters are getting is bad (because it really isn’t), but I didn’t start watching this show for these minor characters. I don’t care about these minor characters. While it is nice to have a few, I care about the Straw Hats, and I do not enjoy them being pushed off to the sidelines with absolutely nothing to do. This is not to say this writing style is bad necessarily. The Alabasta arc had some of these traits and was great nonetheless, but having this type of story for five straight arcs while the main crew is neglected starts to get annoying. When you look at One Piece pre-time skip - specifically arcs like Water 7 - the characters being focussed on were Robin, Usopp, Franky, and Luffy. Then you had awesome smaller arcs like Whisky Peak with great character development for Zoro, Luffy, Nami and Vivi. Enies Lobby is pretty much about Robin, while every Straw Hat gets their own fight and chance to develop. Some of the best moments of the show took place when the main cast was given the attention and focus, and those arcs were great because we dealt with characters that Oda took the time to develop over years; he didn’t start shoving new characters for us to care about down our throats in every single arc. The action in One Piece is great throughout, so comparisons between pre- and post-timeskip is a wash. I will just mention that fights actually are very important in developing characters (contrary to what some idiots presume). The fact is that characters not having fights and not winning fights will ruin any character (Sanji). What makes fights so important to One Piece is not the action per se, but the idea that your life is at stake and they need to find any way to survive. Seeing how far you will go to become stronger when the chips are down was a way we were able to gain insights into most of the Straw Hats early in the series. It doesn’t matter what your role on the ship is: whether you’re a swordsman driven to finally cut steel in pursuit of becoming the best; or a doctor that is forced to the point of eating three rumble balls just to live and not let his friends down. Whether people want to admit it or not, fights are important to everyone in One Piece. Sanji’s best moments were against the wolf guy in Enies Lobby, and part of that was because we saw his intelligence at work. SIDE-NOTE: GrandLineReview, you cannot make a video jerking off to the fight between Luffy and Katakuri, then turn around and say fight aren’t important to character development for a main Straw Hat fighter in Sanji. One Piece is a shonen, after all. Why do I think Oda changed the formula to One Piece? Well, I think Marineford had a major part to play in this. Marineford was an arc that really focused on how grand the One Piece world really is, and since on Luffy was the only Straw Hat present, other characters who probably wouldn’t have that much screen time were suddenly pushed front and center. And what was the result of that arc? One Piece exploded in popularity, and the sales of One Piece manga took off into space. I don’t think it’s too much to assume that Oda saw what happened, and shifted the series more in the direction that made it so popular. Another problem with this show is pacing. The series moves so slow that it takes forever for anything to happen. And no, I’m not just talking about the anime. People assume that the manga itself is infallible and perfect paced, but the reality is that it is also INCREDIBLY slow. The anime makes this problem much worse, but this effect is only so unbearable because of how badly paced the series is in the first place. Whenever a new One Piece arc starts, I actually think to myself, “Great! I’ll check back in two years when they stop faffing about and the story starts getting good.” Side Note: The manga is horribly drawn. Oda shoves so much stuff in one panel that you have no clue what the characters are actually doing, and every chapter looks like a shit-show is taking place. This might piss some people off, but really, some of these panels are inscrutable as hell. Before some idiot messages me saying that I lack the perception to discern what is happening, this is not just me. I’ve watched videos of people reviewing manga chapters, and they will have completely different interpretations of what is happening in certain scenes. This is not an issue with me, this is Oda throwing too much shit on the page. The bottom line is that there is something very wrong with what One Piece has become. There are a few signs that things are improving a little with Wano, but it genuinely feels like this series has lost part of its soul. We began with a small crew of really good people that you actually loved watching interact with each other. Some of my favourite moments in the entire series would be the parts between major arcs, when these awesome characters would be travelling on the Going Merry living with each other; they felt like a family, and I cared about every one of them (well, maybe not Franky). You don’t get this feeling anymore. In many ways, the move from the Going Merry to the Sunny is symbolic of One Piece as a whole: we have moved from a humbler, deeply personal adventure to an overblown and gimmicky monstrosity. The Straw Hats don’t feel like a family anymore, and they feel less real. The focus of the story is almost never on them being together anymore, with Oda opting to focus on building his big shiny world. The reality is that modern One Piece has become a caricature of itself, and whatever gave this series its soul died by the time skip.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8211aa1154,12

Art-8/10 The art isn't that special and is just as i said above, has a rather odd and cartoony art. But this factor is not a burden to this epitome of a series. Sound-8/10 Dont ask any questions and just go for the funimation dub, cause the other dubs seem to make the characters sound like kids. I mean, come on!! They must be at least 17. ''Oh god, Why art thou such mistress?''. And the OST isnt that bad either, but the dubbed one sounds better. Character-10/10 Apart from the plot, the next interesting thing is the ships crew. Everyone has their way of being remembered by the viewers. Each of them has a certain ,character, personality and behaviour. And, the bond they carry with them has a significant role in their character development. Even though it may not seem like it cause, at times they act like , ""I’ve set myself to become the King of the Pirates…and if I die trying…then at least I tried!"". Then after a moment they'll say, ""If I get reincarnated…. I wanna become a clam."" But then again their crew really does have some diversity ,indeed.

"One piece is my favorite anime of all time. I started watching it when i was around 8-10 years old, it was on the morning tv shows i would wake up early just to watch it. Later that day i would meet with my friends, we would chose one of the characters and play, i was Zoro so i had to go around looking for sticks to pretend they d be my all mighty swords. After it stopped airing i grew up and i forgot about it. At the age of 15 i don't even remember how or why i started re-watching it and since that day i ve been hooked up to the story line. For those who don't like long anime, why are you even here? One piece is known to be the longest anime airing, please don't belittle the show because of that, there are plenty of other shorter anime to watch. So here starts my review! (took me long enough huh) The story is about a boy who aims find the legendary treasure One piece and become the pirate King. Why you may ask? For wealth, fame, power? NO! because he wants to be the freest man in the world. Personally, i don't want him to find it, because when that happens it will mean one piece has ended and am gonna cry my self to sleep that night. (pretty mature ain't i huh) The show starts a bit slow with the main character recruiting friends but for me i didn't even realize how the time (episodes) passed. The anime offers you both great comedy and action at the exact amount you d want it, with great jokes and funny faces as well as amazing fights that aren't only about getting stronger just from yelling that you love your friends. Furthermore, as the story progress, it becomes a bit more serious but without ever lacking of comical moments. What i love about it is, that the protagonist doesn't always win, making your adrenaline pump because you don't expect the same result every single time. To conclude, the plot surprised me many times, a minor detail you saw at around episode 60 ends up being very important at for example episode 300 and you stand watching it and wander ""was the author always planning to do this? how can he think so far ahead"" The characters, every character is unique they have their own goals and aren't simple side kicks for the plots sake. Every character has a deep background, it makes you feel that you know them better, you end up laughing with them, crying with them, feeling their agony (am i getting to cliche? ) And that doesn't only apply to the main crew but foes and allies alike. Off course there will be characters you like more and characters you wish they die but never actually do but that happens because of the big character variety it has i think it s normal one or two are not that likable (for example whiny princesses that need help) Also, the characters progress through the story even the air head protagonist gets more serious by the time you ve reached half of the series. So, i ve blabbered enough, if you like long series, amazing action, comedy, character development i think you should give One piece a try. P.S.

"This is the first anime I watched and alhtough I loved it at first, due to crappy animation and episodes consisting of %90 recap recently, Im really sad and giving this show an overall of 5. Almost all of the characters are loveable in One Piece. The story revolves around Luffy traveling from island to island as he makes new friends to find One Piece. This adventure is generally funny, sometimes sad, but enjoyable in overall. However, as I stated before, the crappy animation totally ruined this anime(at least last 200 episodes), but you can still read manga tough. If in future, some good animation company summarize the whole story to 200 epsiodes or so with great animation, this will be one of the best animes without doubt.

There's an episode where the recapping is 10 minutes long, and then nothing happen! Some of the animation even just is a still image with bad background voice acting.

"Rating: 10/10 King of Kings. A juggernaut of anime/manga. Being one of Shonen Jump's 3 Kings, it certainly lives up to its hype. One Piece has enabled me to experience a vast world of adventure, friendship, loyalty, and dreams. With the vast world that Eiichiro Oda has masterfully created, the grippling plots that surprise you when you least expect them, and the lovable characters, it's no wonder One Piece has been the highest selling manga for several consecutive years. With over 600 episodes to date, one may be intimidated to start the series. I agree, it may seem daunting AT FIRST. But trust me, once you start, you'll be unexpectedly marathoning all the episodes and end up wanting more. Give it a try. It is not the best selling manga in Japan for nothing.",10,Recommended,"Feb 7, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7ede2058f7,13

"It was a long time since I didn't watch an anime , but in September 2014, I had some time and when I was young some friends were watching One Piece, but , I didn't care because I was a fanboy of Dragon Ball and I didn't really touched other animes either. One day, I just said why not ? Then I started watching , how do you say ? That one anime who made me fall in love with the Otaku world. This anime is so damn epic, the bromance between characters , all the epic scenes and of course , the smile of Luffy and his nakama who are each time living amazing adventures ( Not much details on that, discover by yourself like I did) This anime made me cried , made me smiled , made me laugh (when Luffy imitates Sanji lol) . This anime made me understood how the anime world is powerful. I spent a whole 3 months watching from episode 1 to 667 and now till December I watch the episode each week and we are in 690, I bought the two Pirate Warriors game and now I'm so hype for the third one . I spent like 300 hours of my life watching this anime , and it was worth it. Thanks a lot Oda , you made me a better person , I have a new hobby, expand the Otaku world to all my social circle (2 new Otakus btw (:)) Watch it, you'll never regret it.",8,Recommended,"Apr 27, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7b6ad44cb6,13
"One Piece is something which can not be explained by words, even though I will try my best to do it. Most people say One Piece get's better as you keep on watching the show, and I totally agree. But there is always a downside to the upside, newbies to the show. We ask all the time when does it get better? When does it get better? The truth is, if you don't like the first 100 episodes give up the show, got it? That's my perspective of this arguement against newbs and fans. Now, time for the actual review. Story: One Piece starts off very slow, when it comes to the storyline, but it improves as times go on. The story in One Piece can not be explained in 200 or even 300 episodes unlike some animes. The world is so complex and the story just adds to the world itself. Keep in mind that, One Piece does geniunly excell at story in later episodes, such as my personal favorite, Alabasta Arc! Art: One Piece is not known because of it's art style. In fact, I would call it mediocre. I don't personally favorite the art style, but it's better than some other animes I have watched. Sound: The soundtrack for this anime is very good. It provides decent OST's which makes the anime way more exciting and impressive. I want to say though that the soundtracks do get repetitive as time goes on. Each character also has their own music track apparently because of the mid-show cutscenes which depict the character, and their own music which is fun to guess for me. Character: I don't know how to stress this enough! The character's in this show are off the hook! The charcacter development stems way beyond any other anime or manga I have watched/read. You may become so attached to the characters, you might start hating the villians because you hope they won't sever that connection you have with those characters. Enjoyment: This anime get's a nine for enjoyment. I know what all of you fans are saying though, ""WTF!??"" and ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??"" because One Piece deserves a 10. The only reason I put a 9 was because of the starting episodes, and other than that this definitely is pure awesomeness. This world is so enjoyable and so are the characters. In fact, I would say it's easy to get addicted to One Piece! The beginning episodes though, not so much! Some people might say though, that the story is slow-paced, so they don't like it, but the story must be slow-paced in order to explain this magnifecent world! Overall: One Piece is amazing in it's own ways, but does have flaws in it's own ways too. The pro's outnumber the con's though, but there are still a bunch of cons. This world truly is worth giving a try, but be warned if you don't like the first 100 episodes, just quit! I give this a 9!",9,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_28b12d65b2,13
"""If I get reincarnated.... I wanna become a clam."" - Monkey D. Luffy"" I often see people pushing away and refusing to try One Piece because it's ""mainstream"" and very long. I am sad to see such a nice series being refused just because it's popular, it's long, the art, or because of the dubbed version. Story: With Pirates, superpowers, giants, and many more things, it is different from what I've seen in other anime. Sure, there are many other series about Pirates, or superpowers, but this combines everything into one long series. Sad moments that make you want to cry, some moments you cry of laughter, anxiously waiting for the next episode to see how everything plays out. Art: The art of One Piece has always been nice. It is bright and lively. Beautiful details, beautiful backgrounds, etc.. Sound: I am not one to overly enjoy the soundtrack on an anime, but One Piece was different. Each opening have been upbeat, refreshing, and nice to listen to. It was also nice when they doubled the beginning, and took the ending song out. The Japanese voice acting fits perfectly for each character you meet throughout the series. Character: You meet many, many characters in One Piece. Every one you meet, minor, major, enemies, friends, they all have their own style. Most characters will make an impact, and you will be remembering them a while after they leave. Enjoyment: I enjoy each and every episode, anticipating new episodes every Sunday. This show comes with lots of heart-warming moments, many surprises, and hilarious moments. Overall: One Piece was a very enjoyable series. I would recommend to anyone who likes action, fights, and humor.",10,Recommended,"Feb 13, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_dc93ad79fd,13
"One Piece is one hell of a piece of anime! It has adventure, Action, Comedy, Emotions, .. almost everything. It is a kind of anime after which after watching you will love pirates and aim for a life with piracy (umm a good piracy) well there are always good and bad in the world. The only problem i find with this anime is that it is a little slow. But the story and character portray are just awesome! The way characters are shown in this series is apt as it makes it more towards the unrealistic pirate world, Superstitions of the seas and their stories. It is an ultimate series with almost everything. There are very few fillers in this series; 1-2 episodes per 100 maybe. So the story progresses a little slowly. But trust me , you are gonna enjoy it a lot !! You might start your own kaizoku-club after watching this superb series.",10,Recommended,"Aug 22, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e1ad0638d4,13
"One Piece is without a doubt the worst anime ever created. Its characters are obnoxious and simplistic, its art style is extremely hit or miss, its music is overbearing to the point of annoyance, it's just straight up sexist, and, worst of all, it is SLOW. PAINFULLY SLOW. UNWATCHABLY SLOW. First and foremost, let's take a look at the story and the characters. With the sheer amount of time put into introducing each member of the crew, establishing their backstories, and then forcing them into a wide array of situations, one might get the impression that One Piece is almost entirely character-driven. This expectation is pretty well established during the show's first arcs--the East Blue section, as we're introduced to the first members of the crew: Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji--each of whom have varying backstories and personal scores to settle before they can become part of the straw hats. Arlong Park, which I would consider to be one of the worst arcs in anime history, really drives home this idea, that before we can get into the action, we have to dissect the stories of our protagonists, antagonists, and featured side characters. So why is Arlong Park so bad, and why do I consider One Piece's characters so utterly shallow? The first answer is that Luffy, largely because of his status as a self-insert for the audience, is often relegated to the sidelines for the sole purpose of not resolving the story too quickly. In Arlong Park, he does nothing, for no reason, for episode after episode, just to fight Arlong at the end. Even though it would have made much more logical sense for Luffy to fight Arlong sooner, the show needed to artificially suspend the action just to tell us about Nami's character via endless flashbacks. If Luffy wasn't just a tabula rasa, if he actually had a personality beyond wanting to eat food being intellectually stunted, this wouldn't be such a problem, but as an empty protagonist, he's relegated to being a plot device. The second answer is a combination of factors: the content of the cast's stories is often cliche and the characters themselves are archetypal, and the way in which that already poor content is delivered is slow and laborious. As I'll further elaborate on later in the review, One Piece is very filler-heavy. The same flashbacks are played sometimes multiple times per episode, only to be played yet again in the next episode on top of a separate recap. To once again use Arlong Park as an example, Nami's incredibly simplistic backstory, that she was a young girl forced into organized crime to help her family, is repeated ad nauseam while we wait for Luffy to waltz in and resolve everything when he finally feels like it. The content here is poor, its delivery is poor, and its pacing is bad. In the end, even after 14 episodes focused entirely on Nami and her past, we're left with little character development and a backstory so deep I already summed it up in less than a sentence. She joins the strawhats, but she remains a thief obsessed with money, just as she was before the arc began. Every main character can be summed up in the exact same way. We meet them, they display their singular character trait, they reveal to us via flashback a pivotal moment in their past that now defines their entire existence, the strawhats help them work towards their defining goal in life, they join the gang. All of this remains simplistic, poorly paced, and formulaic. Even over 300 episodes in, the exact same formula is at play, delivered in the exact same way. Moving on, let's talk about the art style. I've heard a lot of people call One Piece ugly or grotesque, and I strongly disagree. SOME of One Piece is ugly and grotesque, but only some of it. The main characters, minus Usopp, are aesthetically pleasing and thematically consistent in their depictions. Luffy especially is masterfully designed, the Strawhat logo is wonderful, and their first ship, the Going Merry, is quite nice. I think that the majority of One Piece's art problems lie in its inconsistency and its side characters. So many characters in One Piece look disturbing, grotesque, ugly, and frankly obnoxious. And while sometimes this makes sense for thematic consistency, often times the dissatisfying character designs get in the way of my enjoyment of the show. Why do random character look so freaky??? It's unsettling, and I wish that less characters were deep in the uncanny valley. Next up is the music. One Piece has a perfectly fine soundtrack on the face of it, but because it has specific themes for its characters, many arcs overuse tracks to an obnoxious degree. From what I remember, Chopper's introduction arc is what broke me. The same songs are played again and again with the same demented flashbacks. It felt like I was being Pavlov'd by the show runners. That's all I have to say about that. Here we are, at the juicy part of the review, the brain-dead sexism. There's a very well known meme online about how One Piece's female characters ""change"" over time, but assuming you aren't familiar, here's the deal: the main female characters, Robin and Nami, have their breasts increasingly enlarged over the show's runtime, to the point of absurdity. Although this is absolutely hilarious, it's also disgusting, depraved, and obnoxious. I need to know, who the fuck is watching this show for the sex appeal? There's also Sanji, the resident otaku of the group, and then Afro-skeleton, who are massive pervs and painfully unfunny. Their behavior isn't amusing, it's just gross, plain and simple. So how about we elaborate on something I've consistently brought up throughout the review: the pacing. After the show's initial start, every episode becomes ~50% recap. This isn't even a joke. There is one 20 min episode of One Piece for every 1 issue of manga, so the showrunners are forced to pad, and pad, and pad out the run time over and over again until the show reaches near unwatchable status. Now I know what you're saying: skip the recap parts. And while that is possible, it's annoying. Trying to binge watch One Piece feels like hours of just mashing my right arrow key, skipping the intro, the credits, the endless recaps and flashbacks and reused scenes. This might sound hyperbolic, but the reality of the situation is that it is PAINFULLY REAL. Even the most diehard fan could not watch One Piece without skipping through at least some of the filler. This goes hand in hand with the show's other problems to create a truly infuriating watching experience, where the characters go on demented rants recapping the same shallow backstories and events we heard in the last episode, and the episode before that, and before that, and so on. On top of that, the show's endless cast of side characters fill up a good 20% of the show's valuable remaining run time. And while I sometimes enjoyed time spent with them, I soon found myself waiting for all those side adventures to pay off, for the non-essential characters to reappear, for there to be any character development at all for either them, or our mains (other than just powering up), but that's the thing about One Piece, there is no development. All those side characters you were looking forward to checking back in with? They've just disappeared permanently after a pointlessly lengthy one-off introduction. One Piece is a lot like the controversial live action show LOST, except LOST had an ending. It didn't go on forever. In the end it answered its mysteries, it had conclusions, it had full character arcs. One Piece never ends. It's an endless stream of new characters the audience will never see again, their introduction and short lived examination acting as nothing but a substitution for any form of character development or main story progression. And even though I truly despise this show, what kept me watching were the small glimpses I got of greatness. The interesting arc premises, the overarching mystery, the lore and world building, these all genuinely interested me and kept me watching. But in the end, there isn't anything there. To get literally anything out of this show you have to voluntarily waste your time for hours upon hours, watching as nothing changes except Nami's cup size. I guess that brings me to one last point before the conclusion: THE MAIN STORY IS GOOD. I like the lore of One Piece, I like the pirates, I like most of the antagonists, and I like how the main characters just fuck around murdering cops and helping people out when they feel like it. But what I don't like is how rarely the arcs pay off, how unimportant the side characters are, how overwrought the flashbacks become, and how little was revealed about the main story in my over 340 episode watch time. The only conclusion I can realistically come to having watched so much of it is that this show is meant to waste your time. So why on earth is One Piece so highly rated? Two reasons: First, the initial couple of arcs are so bad that they generally put off anyone who might have mixed feelings about the show, weren't very interested to begin with, or were never going to be invested. The few people that do actually make it through the Arlong Park arc, i.e. the worst thing of all time, generally enjoy the show a lot more, as its almost all uphill from there. Second, sunk cost fallacy. As you watch more and more One Piece, a certain mentality begins to set in. You find yourself saying again and again, ""I've come this far, it'll get better"" ""Just one more episode, things'll pick up"" ""Just one more arc, and something will finally happen..."" And yet the more you watch, the more you realize nothing is ever going to change. That the small crumbs of story and meaning dropped every 20 episodes simply aren't enough anymore. And yet it's so hard to stop watching a show that you're hundreds of episodes into. That you've invested far too many hours in to just drop all of a sudden. It's the people that stick around, that become invested to the point of delusion, that simply can't escape anymore, who dominate the ratings online. Do yourself a favor, avoid this one.

"One Piece is a show that explores a futuristic version of humanity, it chooses to explore the ""Worst"" state of humanity's evolution. it's a really interesting concept, one that isn't explored as often as it's counterpart, as most futuristic shows lean more towards the optimistic side of things and all the accomplishments humans (can) achieve in the future. The show manages to have the most bleak, grim and tragic atmosphere i've ever seen. throughout this whole series, nothing good happens. or maybe the things that happen are good, but the way i interpret them is not good? the show explores multiple ideologies and beliefs and showcases how they clash together and at the end of the day, it doesn't try to sway you in one side or the other, it doesn't try to convince you ""this is a good guy"" and "" this is a bad guy"". it allows you to form your own opinions. it approaches fairly heavy topics like the meaning of life, faith, suffering, and what truly makes someone a human being. most of the ""explanations"" are delivered through the art and through showing you things and not explaining things in a clear way. the show has a fairly slow pace, which a lot of people do have a problem with but i personally found it to be really important for the latter parts to be meaningful. now to go into the more analytical ratings. Story: 10/10. The story in One Piece is quite fascinating to me, and it's portrayed in a way that i absolutely adore. While we do have a main character, Ichise. the story focuses on many different people at the same time, switching between their perspectives on the city, on life, and the world as a whole. most of the story is based around the city of lux, and it's apparent downfall into chaos. as mentioned before, the way the story is portrayed is slightly different than in other shows, as you may be used to having narration or some kind of monologue explaining the world to you, most of the time that is missing in One Piece. the show just throws you into the middle of everything and tries to slowly reveal things to you through it's symbolism and art. While One Piece can be described in many ways, such as it's a story about gang wars, or a story about a futuristic world gone wrong, etc. i'd say the most accurate description of One Piece is that it's a study of how humans feel towards being human, how they feel towards death, towards living, what really is the meaning of living? is there a point? is the series nihilistic or is it a story about hope? these are all questions you might be asking yourself while watching through this show. Characters: 10/10. I would say that the characters are what makes One Piece a masterpiece. to be able to present so many fundamentally different beliefs and opinions and still make the viewer not have a specific ""antagonist"" is quite amazing. every character has meaning, every character at the end of the day worked towards their beliefs and their ideals. The pain in this series feels real. the interactions feel real. The dialogue seems like something actual human beings would say to eachother. and the characters feel raw, their emotions are truly expressed in such a raw, unfiltered manner that you can't help but be attached to them or respect them even if you don't agree with how they view life. every character in this show had justifiable actions. all of them made sense. not a single time did i see something and think "" what the fuck this is just stupid"". it all just made sense. it genuinely just felt real. Art and sound: 10/10. while the story and characters are both wonderful and perfect. they wouldn't be enough without the way they were portrayed through the art and soundtrack, as many of One Piece's episodes have little dialogue, most of the series uses it's soundtrack and art to portray things that the dialogue doesn't. the art is honestly perfect. The color of this anime feels so fitting as it has a largely grey, bleak feel to it. never truly changing, always reminding you of how grim and hopeless this world is. the soundtrack reflects the same thing. most of the tracks are dark and further amplify the feeling of melancholy you can never shake off throughout this series, the voice acting didn't fail at any time throughout the series, i'd say ichise's voice acting stands out as again, the amount of agony portrayed in just the first and second episode was enough to convince me that the voice actor is doing a good job. the opening is incredibly good, the ending is relaxing. there's genuinely no complaints, except just ONE instance of a soundtrack being way too loud and kind of just terrible in the last episode. but that was only around 4 minutes of pain, and that would be petty to deduct a point for. Overall, I feel that i am not giving this series justice with my review because it's quite hard to express just how well it portrays human emotion. from the moment i saw the opening i knew that this was a show i'll give a 10. i went in with incredibly high expectations, and those were still surpassed. my only regret is how long it took me to actually watch this show, and actually ignoring it for so many years. but honestly. watching it now was not so bad, because it genuinely affected my views towards death and living. and made me view life in a different way. I absolutely love this show. and i highly recommend it to anyone that can stomach a rather painful story.",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 2, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f51013034,13
"Yes. Reading One Piece is a better experience, but there is still no better modern epic story told than One Piece. Read it, watch it, suck on it, lick on it, whatever. Its the greatest children's story, teen story, and adult story wrapped all-in-one. The episodic nature of the arcs makes it easy to binge in spurts. The art style changing throughout the story is subtle enough to be unnoticeable, until the time-skip. Which is jarring but still easy to digest. Luffy as a main character doesn't feel human, but everyone else around him does. He's almost jesus-like in nature but in a way thats not corny. Everyone can find something to like about One Piece due to its vastness, but I believe the culture behind it forces hate.

"Asking someone to watch 1,000+ episodes of a show is a hard ask, but One Piece definitely justifies it. Yes... the show is drawn out at points and some arcs could absolutely have been made more concise, but this is really a show about characters and plot first and foremost. Everything you experience when watching this show matters. The smallest details are called back hundreds of episodes later, and characters (even the minor ones) have properly fleshed out stories that make you feel attached to them. Everything connects, and the fact that the show is ongoing, even after all these years, makes the show intriguing even for newcomers because 'no one knows the conclusion', and therefore there are certain things that can't be spoiled even by long time watchers. There is absolutely some of the best character development in all of anime in the first few arcs of the show (the East Blue Saga) that sets the stage for later arcs while also creating an unbreakable bond between the viewer and the main cast. Once everyone is fully (or I should say mostly) developed, the plot and world-building really start to kick in. Prior to viewing, I would chastise One Piece for being so drawn out... I mean, if they can find the treasure in an hour-and-a-half in Pirates of the Caribbean, what the hell is taking Monkey D. Luffy so long??? But the one fact a friend told me that finally convinced me to watch One Piece, and one which you Reader might take to heart as well, is this: One Piece is not a show just about ""finding the treasure."" It is a show with incredible thought given to its characters and incredible care given to its world-building.

"In a vast ocean of anime, few manage to capture the pure essence of adventure like One Piece. From its thrilling beginning to its most recent arcs, the series continues to captivate me with its incomparable sense of exploring unknown islands, facing imminent dangers, and forging bonds as strong as steel among crewmates. The sense of adventure in One Piece is really immersive. The Straw Hat Pirates' journey through the Grand Line is an emotional rollercoaster, full of highs and lows, yet always keeping the flame of adventure alive. From the imposing Grand Line to the exotic and surreal islands, the world of One Piece is vast and diverse. One of the most captivating aspects of One Piece is the sense of belonging to the Straw Hat crew ( we really do feel like a ""nakama""), known for their indomitable bond of camaraderie. The element of mystery is skillfully implemented throughout One Piece's narrative, keeping viewers eager for more with each twist and turn. From the enigmatic Poneglyphs to the secrets of the World Government and the true story behind the legendary One Piece, the anime maintains a veil of secrecy that keeps fans speculating and theorizing endlessly. However, despite all these positives, I cannot ignore the main point of criticism: the slow pacing of the anime, especially in the more recent arcs. While the careful world-building and character development are admirable, there are moments when the pacing feels sluggish, testing the patience of even the most dedicated fans.

First of all the One Piece anime is based on a manga. It's manga is the most popular manga of all times becouse of the drawing but most importantly becouse of the story. So the anime has the same amazing story. This anime has a lot of different characters. And yes.. Every character is different. The basic idea of the anime about Pirates is amazing becouse a pirate needs to be strong. At this point comes in the fact that the main characters are evolving themselves all the time.

"(This review applies to both the manga and anime. Anime-only stuff like animation and music are not accounted for.) Short version: One Piece is not for me. I can see why people love it. If you love OP, good. That means you found something worthwhile that I couldn’t. Don’t let my opinion interfere with your enjoyment. My not being a fan of OP is not a personal attack against you. You do you. I am only writing this to elaborate to fans why some of us remain skeptical of OP, even after giving it a go. Long version: Shounen action. Battle Shounen. Or just plain “Shounen” to many Western anime fans. Whatever you call it, fantastical action-adventure series originating from comic magazines for young males (shounen manga) is by far the most popular genre of Japanese popular culture in the West. For most Westerners, shounen action is all that anime is. Outside of Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note (the last of which being from Shounen Jump, LOL), about 90 percent of anime fans I know IRL only, only, ONLY watch/read shounen action properties. And this isn’t just kids; people my age and those middle-aged also only, only, ONLY watch/read shounen action series. Every now and again, you might find someone who’s watched Spirited Away, but it cannot be overstated just how everywhere shounen action is. A lot of anime shows I’ve heard described as “Popular”, such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Re:Zero, Gurren Lagann, Angel Beats, Hellsing and Madoka Magica, may as well not exist to most anime fans I know in person. For SOME anime fans, this is a bad thing. To certain members of “geek” culture, it is a sin to say “OMG! I. Love. Anime. So. MUUUUCH!” And to only, only, ONLY watch DBZ and Naruto. I am not one of those people. There are some shounen action properties I love. Remember my old review of Fullmetal Alchemist? That’s one example right there. However, if you were to ask me of a long-running action series to recommend, One Piece is not one of them. OP is a shounen action series from Weekly Shounen Jump. It needs no introduction. It being the best-selling manga/graphic novel series of all time should make that evident enough. It’s a manga that has remained in production since 1997, with an anime that has remained in production since 1999. It is a phenomenon. It’s more popular in some countries than others, but anyone even vaguely knowledgeable of anime has at least heard of OP. This is a tale of pirates, those who choose not to bind themselves to the rule of law, explorers, con artists, scalawags, warriors of virtue, cooks, and other assorted individuals. It’s a world where everyone is trying to claim the greatest treasure buried by the greatest pirate of all time. OP follows Luffy, the leader of the Straw Hat Pirates, a wandering troupe of lost souls out to find the One Piece. OP’s author, Eiichiro Oda, designed the series to be the sort of manga he would’ve wanted to read as a kid. You can certainly see a lot of imagination behind it. My quick summary makes it sound intriguing. You can see why there are legions of fans. There are also legions of people who gave up on OP like me. There are legions who will never try it out. I’m not alone. I got friends with zero interest in OP. And I have not one, but two friends who dropped OP like me. Our reasons slightly differ, but they all stem from the same issue of the fact that OP never ends. The story of OP has run longer than the Fate franchise. It’s lightyears longer than anything Tolkien ever put out. The tax codes for the state of California are a brief afterthought compared to OP. I found a YouTube video that attempted to summarize all of OP. It was 6 hours long! 6! Now, does being long necessarily mean it’s not good? Of course not. My Hero Academia is over a hundred episodes in length, and it’s the best quote-on-quote “shounen” I’ve seen since FMA Brotherhood. The problem is OP doesn’t really do a whole lot with its infinite length. Something I’ve learned throughout my life is memory tends to remember the most impactful moments. As you age, you forget things and moments that weren’t majorly impactful. This is a blessing and a curse, for while your most cherished memories will stay beside you, your most painful memories will, too. I brought up the concept of memory because, One Piece, for all the content it has, didn’t leave much impact on my memory. It doesn’t really do much to differentiate itself from similar series. Progress, if you can call it that, is borderline non-existent. I can’t remember any great lesson the show gave out, no scene that really stood out in my mind. All I remember are character flashbacks and outlandish fight scenes. Speaking of memories, do you remember my review of Cowboy Bebop? I caught a LOT of flak for that back in the day, because I “only” gave it a 6, and didn’t fill my review with words like, “hype” “GOAT” “timeless” and “iconic.” Despite my many issues with CB, I still found it more enjoyable than OP. Let me repeat that, even though I found about 80 percent of CB cliched and aimless, I would still take that, warts and all, over OP any day. At least CB had the courtesy to end, the courtesy to at least let stuff happen in its runtime, stuff that shifted the status quo. Now that I’ve brought up OP’s lack of narrative progress, allow me to describe a typical scenario, just to give you an idea of its status quo. The Straw Hats arrive at a new island. The island’s citizens are being terrorized by a pirate/corrupt official/some other sort of villain. The Straw Hats fight this villain. They win. They leave the island, only to end up doing the same thing on a different island over and over. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. Now do you understand why I, of all people, wanna watch CB again? My first friend who gave up on OP, lasting for at least a few hundred episodes, much longer than me, dropped OP for this reason, the fact that this, like some other shounen action series, becomes nonstop fighting. Too much fighting, not enough anything else. This is not to say you can’t EVER have tons of battles. Perhaps the series could do a commentary on the constant pirate warfare going on: does the nonstop violence eventually exact a toll on the psyches of the Straw Hats? Is the series saying something about a society that solves ALL its problems through combat? No and no. You’re not getting anything like that. OP is not a work of fiction, but more a series of wrestling matches done in a fantastical manner. Beyond a few character backstories and a few memorable (if simplistic) villains, there is no meaning beyond the video game levels of metahuman fighting. Watching Luffy win battle after battle is no different from watching a pro Street Fighter player level opponent after opponent. Might be exciting the first few times, but there’s nothing offered beyond that. It was my friend’s reason for giving up, and it was one of my reasons, too. My other friend who dropped OP, lasting about 500 or so episodes, was also because of the fighting, but not the nonstop nature of it. Rather, they lost interest because OP commits another common sin of shounen action; the fights and power system become too crazy. It’s the same reason I don’t watch the later parts of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and one reason I dropped Naruto and Bleach back in the day. Now, I only saw the first 40 or so episodes. The action scenes didn’t have this problem, and in fact, it was kind of fun to see the Straw Hats use their unique talents to win. Nonetheless, I did do some research on the Fandom page for OP (never a good sign when I don’t care for spoilers when writing about something) and can confirm the following: If you thought Dragon Ball Super’s power system was convoluted, then don’t read or watch the later portions of OP! It reminds me of a quote from a movie I saw as a kid, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.” (5 sequels, and none of them rival the original Jurassic Park.) To its credit, OP doesn’t start off a victim of power creep, but it eventually falls into that trap, should you attempt to marathon the series. Another knock is the characterization. It’s nothing special. Luffy is the sort to fight first, ask questions never. Sanji loves to hit on women. Nami is greedy. Usopp is a coward, except when the chips are down. Surface level stuff. With that said, there was one Straw Hat I liked, Zorro. Maybe it’s just because he lives by a code similar to the samurai, but I found his backstory and his code of honor intriguing. Beyond that, he’s largely just a macho warrior who can fight with three swords, but he stood out for me. The other standout was the villains. Being a children’s franchise, the villains are very obviously evil, but that’s part of OP’s appeal, to not only see grandiose examples of diabolical lowlifes, but to also see the heroes knock the villains down a peg. Since I didn’t get very far in the show, I don’t know any of the other major characters. Not great, but could be worse. I give this franchise a 5 because while I don’t like OP, I don’t despise it. It’s not pro-fascist and cynically manipulative like Mahouka. It’s not annoying and insultingly stupid like Kill La Kill. It’s not chock full of contrivances like Code Geass. It’s not offensive like a good number of American sitcoms. It’s not amateurish like RWBY. Its attempts at humor aren’t as painfully unfunny as Slayers’ attempts at humor. It’s not overly random like Fooly Cooly. One Piece excels by not committing some of the biggest mistakes of some of its contemporaries. But ask yourself, in a world where Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia and Re:Zero exist and can be watched for free online, is “not being insultingly stupid” good enough? Oh yeah, almost forgot, the artwork. I feel the same way about the art. I neither like nor dislike it. Many people have avoided OP because of the art. I should criticize them for being shallow, but they are lucky. OP’s art is cartoony, yes. Everyone has the same sort of smile with the massive teeth. Again, it excels when compared to the moeblobs of recent light novels adaptations, but I also find it rather simplistic when compared to many other shounen action series. I will point out that I spared myself the embarrassment of the female designs post-timeskip since I dropped OP so early. This might just be the grounded realist in me, but I don’t find female character designs that are 100% bust curvature and 0% everything else to be particularly charming. Sad to see it shares a flaw with Bleach in this regard. So to hardcore fans of OP, like I said in the start, you keep doing you. I just wanted to tell you that some of us tried. Some of us tried for hundreds of episodes and chapters. Some of us tried for years. I tried for about 40 episodes, alternating between sub and dub. But the simple truth is, nothing is universal. Some people don’t like shounen action in general. Some like me prefer the shounen denomination known as The First Church of Deku. Some people simply can’t commit to a single work of art that has taken nearly 30 years to complete with no apparent end in sight. For some people, that is a strength. For others, it’s too much. Whatever the case, I think we can all agree that it’s remarkable that OP has run for as long as it has. I do respect Oda and Toei for being able to maintain one series this long, because to do so is nothing short of Herculean. Nonetheless, one person’s trash is another person’s buried treasure, and while OP has its strengths, I can’t call myself a fan.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 27, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b1b11b1781,13

"The reason I am giving this show a 10/10 is very simple. This show seems to get better and better with every arc, sure some things you may not like about certain arcs and subjectively you may like one arc better than another but objectively you cannot say Oda doesn't deliver an amazing story and honesty if you wanna know why this show is a masterpiece it's a very simple answer. It's the characters! The way each character is designed and their personality is simply iconic, like if you asked me to name each character of the crew and their personality I could do it easily, of course as long as I have gotten that far in the show. Right now i'm 640 episodes in and this show is still surprising me too like some people say ""how could you watch something so long? Doesn't it get boring?"" and honestly I don't think I have ever been bored once by this show, like each arc does something so unique and truly builds upon these characters and while the show isn't perfect, it gives you so much enjoyment to see where these characters go and I think it is awesome that throughout the show you truly do learn about these characters and that you also feel like one of the straw hats and you are right there in the fray with them.

I would say F*@k all of them, Watch this anime because it is fun, it has great story, characters (except for Nami), Unique art and is enjoyable. If you don't like long anime's don't watch it. it is simple as that. But bashing this anime jus because it is long is not called anime reviewing it is just complaining. The world building in one piece is just awesome, Because of such a big world there are many possibilities of storyline. One piece should be watched arc wise, complete one arc and then leave the anime and then watch another arc after 2 - 3 weeks, it is alright.

"Let me say this right now: One Piece will forever be my favorite series. I have faith that Eiichiro Oda will continue to write with the amazing skill that he has and will not let it falter like the writers of Naruto and Bleach did toward the end. But but BUT there's two big reasons that I say series rather than anime. In truth, I follow the manga far more closely than the anime itself. There are two reasons for this: the filler and the animation budget. As a long time One Piece fan, I'm sure that many of you understand what I'm referring to. But to those who are jumping into the series this late (good luck binge watching that, kids) I shall explain the faults of the anime. Let's start off with the big one: animation. Now, when I say animation I'm not talking about art style. I think Oda's art style is unique and he delivers it very well. No, I'm referring to the amount of crappy stills put into a fight scene. The amount of quality that fails as the series progressed. Up until the Whitebeard War arc (which you could say is currently the halfway point of the series) the animation had its own charm. It wasn't overly flashy but it certainly got the job done and both the fight scenes and the relaxed scenes looked fairly decent. But once the New World hit, something happened to the budget of the animation, as many of the scenes lacked a lot of detail and its disheartening to see. Now, recently, the animation has started to hike back up. I don't know how long this will last or if it will be just for these few scenes in between the big climax, but time will tell on that. Onto the second problem: the filler. Now, unlike Naruto and Bleach, One Piece's filler isn't done through seasons of standalone arcs. There's only a few of those throughout the series and generally don't last that long in the first place. The filler, much like the animation slope, came later in the series, and worked its way in between episodes. What Toei does is instead of making arcs to distance themselves from catching up to the manga or just taking a few months break, they instead will expand on one scene very terribly and ruin the flow that Oda put forward. Something that lasted one or two panels in the manga will last close to ten minutes in the anime. This might not be such a problem if Toei didn't make the expanded scenes so ugly looking or interesting. Instead you can just feel the laziness of the scene. With those complaints out of the way, lets get into the good stuff: everything else. The story of One Piece is fairly simplistic in nature as its usually just following Luffy and crew from one island to another, usually involving Luffy saving said island from some evil mastermind. Now this might seem like some rinse and repeat idea, but what Oda does to make each arc different is simple: He makes each island have its own genuine feel. In the East Blue arc, all of the islands are generally identical, but there's a reason for that: East Blue is the weakest sea on the planet. Its meant to a more relaxed adventure with more personal problems than outside problems. Once you get to the Grand Line, each island starts to pick up in scale. First big arc is Alabasta, a literal gigantic desert island under the influence of a Warlord. Next is an island in the sky that the crew shoots themselves up to. After that, an island that's' like a giant water utopia, and so on. Each island has its own unique aesthetic as well as a unique set of problems. Each arc feels well crafted and is able to stand on its own two feet in quality. Next up, the characters. I think this is the biggest thing for a lot of fans because its definitely one of my biggest things about One Piece: I LOVE the main cast. Monkey D. Luffy is a fairly simple character as he's an idiot with a lot of strength and a big dream he's constantly chasing. Sounds pretty familiar, right? Well, Luffy as well as many of the other crew members have plenty of unique things going for them. For one, Luffy isn't a fight crazed protagonist who's constantly seeking a bigger challenge, even if he's constantly picking fights with the big names of the world. Believe it or not, he'd rather go on adventures than fight, even if he does enjoy it to a degree. Not to mention he's aware of his own faults, having assembled a crew that can act in ways that he can't. Another thing about characters in One Piece is that, somehow some way, Oda does not let any of the named ones go to waste. Somebody who seemed to only have a bit part in the past or seemed insignificant before is very likely to come back up again and have a larger role in the scale of things. The thing about it is, Oda knows how to make even subvillains seem sympathetic if he wants. In the previous arc, a very small time bit villain has a flashback during his fight with one of the crew and it ends up making you feel bad for him. To be honest, I was shocked how much I ended up liking him. His design is so dumb but the design has a reason behind it and you end up thinking 'wow, that's actually cool of him'. Seriously, if anything is the highlight of this series, I'd say its the character moments. On to the music and sound, the music is pretty on point. It's not the greatest anime OST ever created but it certainly gets the job done. When the series wants you to feel hyped up, its got the track for you. When its got a scene that is sad, you know it's about to play the perfect mood setter. The only complaint I might have about the sound is the eye catchers that pop up when you can tell its switching to commercial. Sometimes those can get annoying and ruin the mood of a scene especially if things are getting intense or sullen. Other than that, the OST is good. As for the voices, I'd say generally the voices fit each of their roles perfectly. I remember when I first watched One Piece subbed, I thought 'what the hell is up with Luffy's voice??' but as I continued to watch the series, I realized that the VA for Luffy is incredible. Her emotional content and strength of voice is amazing. Not to mention she's actually in her 70's. You have to admire that kind of skill in a VA. When Luffy's going to make a big exclamation, she's right on it. When Luffy's in pain or suffering, she can put that out like nothing. Don't disregard the Japanese VA just because the voice seems childish, she does a fantastic job as Luffy. The same goes for the rest of the crew, but Luffy's VA stands out for me the most. Well, I believe that about wraps up my review. Overall, while I do prefer the manga to the anime due to the reasons above, there's plenty to love in the anime regardless of that. There's a reason that this series has survived so long and has ruled as the king of Shounen since its arrival. If you don't mind the length and time required to be put in, I highly recommend this series.",9,Recommended,"Feb 21, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_79396146d8,20

"One piece is my favorite manga. Probably the one I've been for the longest time. I started animated when I was a kid, I was 9 years old. I was watching with my mother and sister, we were having a good time, until I was 11~12 years old. I stopped the anime for a year or two, and continued it until episodes 700 where I read the manga. Well, no big differences, but I liked reading manga. Then I wanted to continue following the animated despite everything, but.... I was bored. I stopped following the anime, but looked at it again later and once the nostalgia was set aside, the animated adaptation was an insult to the manga. I recognize that Oda has the ability to stretch some bows / pass through the manga, except that unlike the Toei he does it well. So yes, the Japanese dubbing is good, the ost too, there are very well adapted scenes, especially the moving scenes. But the animation, the slowness of the episodes, it kills One Piece. Toei, how can you adapt a 14-page chapter in 20 minutes? It's impossible without stretching as unnecessarily as you do. Who would it kill to make One Piece an animated in season, like all those currently out there? Who would spit on waiting to have a better adaptation than the current one? No one! No one! So to sum up, the main flaw of the One Piece animation is its awful slowness, the animation.... Worse than average.... In fact, it's basically the manga with more squares for the same shot, to which we add sound and voice. That's the principle of an animate, it's true, but this time it's not done right. The Wa no series is better, but let's not hide our faces except for a big change of style and an improvement of the animation, there is always this frightening slowness that is omnipresent. It's a little higher than the average, but it doesn't save everything. To be exact, I gave up when Urashima and Luffy gave each other their one-minute palm punch.

"One Piece One Piece is a Manga series produced by Eiichiro Oda. Before he produced One Piece he had already produced several series including ""Wanted"" and ""Monsters and Romance Dawn"". The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy whose body gets the properties of rubber after eating one of the many devils fruits (which are fruits that give certain powers) that prevent him from swimming. With his crew called Straw Hat pirates. One Piece is by far the best anime I have seen. But not everyone shares the same opinion as me, let's fix that, shall we? The story of One Piece usually consists of the Straw Hat Pirates who travel from island to island and experience crazy adventures. Although every crew member has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: reaching the end of the treacherous Grand Line. The style of One Piece is one of the elements that brings many people to the series. The style is quite old like Dragonball Z. Anyway, the quality of the animation improves steadily as the show moves. The show is now broadcast in HD. I absolutely love the music of One Piece. There are so many different types of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, happy, scared, epic, intense, and so on. For each of these situations there is a unique piece of music that plays in the background. What's more is that each character has his own style of music? Unlike the majority, I find the animation creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately, people see it as something or a twist and One Piece quickly assesses something infantile. An anime does not have to be complex to be good enough. It can be anything, as long as it provides satisfaction. And One Piece does that.",9,Recommended,"May 9, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d9f419c837,20
"One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious. It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything. The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it. I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it.

"One Piece will be the kind of show that you are thankful to have continued watching. Like starting Madoka Magica, or Clannad or heck even Game of Thrones, it's something that only gets better and better. Unlike Bleach or Fairy Tail and Naruto, the first few episode doesn't immediately show-off an epic fight or get your pity--OP is pretty chill in the beginning. Take Anohana for example: in Anohana, the first 11 episodes were slow, but they were buildup for that last episode--the awesome last ep that squeezed your heart and tear-ducts dry. For One Piece, the story really starts rolling until they get five crew members, which is like 50 eps in. After that, 700 episodes of awesomeness awaits you. The core of the show is about wonder--Luffy wants to be the Pirate King because he believes that the Pirate King is the freest person in the World. He is a Pirate by his own standards, not killing or pillaging, and instead helping people with his life on the life cuz he freaking wants to. But there is so much more to this show--it's silly, it's light-hearted, it's dumb fun to watch all the adventures he and his crew go through. But still, some scenes are packed with much more meaning and personal stakes that makes it difficult to turn away. As much as I love One Piece, I recommend to stop watching the anime and switch to the manga when you get to the Dressrosa Arc. This is where the anime suffered due to stretching out the anime to converting one chapter per episode--diluting the tension of the show to zero. (Golden rule of anime is to convert two chapters of manga per animated episode). (You know, so the show wouldn't catch up to where the manga currently is and suffer the same problem as AOT/SNK and have to stop for 4 years).

"This is my first review of anything ever and it's fitting that it goes to one of my all-time favourite things ever. One Piece is what got me into the manga and anime community, by now everyone has heard about its great world building and I'm not going to go into that because there are better and more informative reviews for that. I just want to say as a massive one piece fan who is all caught up with the manga is that every anime and manga fan should watch or read one piece, it deserves all the hype it gets. Now I know that this review is not at all organized but, there is one fault that I think sticks out. In my opinion, Oda writes all the backstories of the characters from the same template. It could be his style or it could be that he just hasn't realised but all the characters follow the same pattern - as a child, the character went through some trauma and now that trauma affects the said character in some way which defines their worldview.",9,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7b049e6adb,20
"Ultimately, what you have to accept when you're considering watching a show like one piece is that it's over 800 episodes long, and still not over. This is a daunting task even for the most skilled of bingers. As much as I love this show, there are somethings I feel that I need to inform you of before I can honestly recommend One Piece to anyone. There are two very distinct parts of One Piece, and that is a result of the 2yr time-skip that occurs. For the portion of the anime up until the time-skip I would recommend watching every episode (including filler). Practically all of the early filler episodes utilize one piece's comedy and characters to their fullest, and the fillers don't feel like filler; these fillers feels very in-line with the source material. However, after the time-skip this changes, and the fillers become wastes of time. Additionally, you'll want to instantly skip the first 4-5 minutes of every episode in the post time-skip section as that is simply the opening + 3 or 4 minutes of re-cap. If you do get up-to-date, you will notice a few instances of lack-luster animation, however, this is true of any anime that runs on weekly releases. Luckily, the scenes that really matter still seem to be getting the attention they deserve. One Piece's biggest problem is that they have purposely slowed the pacing of the anime to give the manga more time. The best solution if you dislike the pacing, but wish to keep enjoying the story, is to simply read the manga. Ultimately, I can't end a review on one of my favorites on a bad note, so I will end it with this. One Piece's greatest strength is that it's about how its protagonist (Luffy) changes the world. This is unique to many other stories which are generally focused upon how the world or other factors change the protagonist, and is one of the reasons why One Piece is able to continue a connected story over hundreds of episodes.",10,Recommended,"May 8, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9b0a00b5f6,20
"In my humble opinion the anime ended at episode 500. After this episode the amount of fan service and making episode unnecessarily longer is annyoing. The boob balance has placed this anime on a cringe spectrum for me, every time i try to watch it and i see those enomourse milk bags i just can't take it but laught at how bad this anime has gotten and how poor of taste the creators are. I was with this anime for many years, yet i can't take it. (I have stopped watching several years ago on episode 800). I hope someday we will see a decent re-work of this. That wont include so many milk bags and make episodes speak a story and not just try to stretch it. The story over all is great its slow it has good pacing yet again untill episode 500 or maybe a little later, it gets worse, a lot worse. I would rather see this anime take a break than make such episodes that you can essentially watch in like 10 minutes yet they have a 25 minute watch time. Art style is amazing even with older technology and way of drawing it still holds up to this day. After introducing the new art style after episode 500 its just not the same it feels like some echii or hentai show this is not why i came here. Music, i dont think i have any kind of bad music expierience with this anime so at least this stayed on its high level. Characters they all feel unique, have often unique powers and souls. They have their past that is often explained and shown to viewer that is a very nice way of showing a character if done correctly. You learn a lot about characters and you care about their stories that are more often than not intresting and have plot connections. Enjoyement was a 10 untill episode 500. After that it felt to 0 it just feels so forced to watch this art style and overly long episodes that speak about nothing yet take so much of your time. Overall i would give it a 4/10 for just bcuz the 1st 500 episodes are a masterpiece, yet later its all abandonend for some coomers and fan service. Lowering the score greatly bcuz of it.",4,Not Recommended,"Jul 23, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a80373e6f6,20
"Action, adventure, comedy-- If you're looking for the perfect mix of epic action and dramatic, tear-jerking scenes, well my friend, One Piece is for you. I think in order to watch One Piece, you've gotta throw away any of your first opinions, because the thing that threw me off at first was the art style, as well as the ""overwhelming"" number of episodes. So disregard those right now, or else you'll miss out on something huge. And stay committed! The overall character development is sure to cause some tears at some point. Watching (or reading) the powerful backstories of the characters, as well as the inspirational effort shown as they overcame them is truly remarkable. Something many anime have, and always will, have a struggle with, and Oda pulled it off for nine characters, all equally amazing. Along with the development, the emotions triggered while watching this anime are unstoppable. Be prepared for tears at some point-- grab your tissues. The way the story is presented, you're bound to feel a pang in your chest, or tear up. The message portrayed in this fun, upbeat anime is also something outstanding. In every episode, One Piece never fails to inspire you, as the characters all chase down their dreams. ""Follow your dreams, and don't let anyone prove you wrong."" One Piece is my favourite anime, ever. You'll love it, and it isn't anything like what you may have thought!",10,Recommended,"Jun 7, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2427fc327c,20
"Lemme say this first, I watched over 100 anime, almost all the main streams and out of all them I gotta say that this right here, One Piece, it the greatest I have watched by far. Here's the review Story - The author really knows what hes doing. The main character Luffy, is a rubber human after eating the gomu gomu no mi. His goal is to become the Pirate King so he sails out of his small home village to pursue his dream meeting many people on the way, some that become his friends, and some that join his crew. Luffy although stupid, he knows how to tell you everything with just his fist. I don't how the author did it, but the way he makes luffy express certain things in few words and simple actions. Although he is an idiot, hes a genius in the way he is. His entire crew all join with a similar goal in life all linked to luffy's may it be to sail the whole world, make a map of the whole world, or discover what hasn't been discovered. Another thing they do great in this anime is foreshadowing, things from the first few episodes can come around again 500 episodes later. They explain a lot of things, and when you forget about them they bring it back. They constantly hint at the Will of D, Luffy's father, Luffy's brother, as well as what one piece REALLY is, and how everyone is connected to it. This is the only anime that can make me shed tears over and over.600 episodes out and it still hasn't gotten dull, virtually no fillers, and still a bunch of story left to be told. It's a huge world with different species, races, discoveries. Art - the Art is not the best, it's a unique style and many people hate on it. Unlike a majority of anime that fail to realize that there are many different looking people in the world, and in the world of one piece there are even more different looking people, ugly, deformed, strange, attractive, large, small, they are all drawn in their own way. The author is an artist and can draw bleach like drawing but doesn't, its not like he cant. What I really like about this drawing is the way it can express emotion. If you look at luffy angry, you feel it, you feel the intensity of his angry, its like you wanna punch your screen just as hard you wanna punch the villain in the face. Sound - The music is good, very pirate like if i were to describe it. Each crew member have their own theme song that match their personality well. They know how to make situations sound good using the music. Characters - Well developed, all though they look like a happy bunch now but each member has their own dark past, all of them been through a lot and almost all of the back stories will stab you in the heart and make you cry for them. It's because of their past that they have such a respect for luffy, the one that understands them and can bring out their good sides as well as vanquish their bad. Enjoyment - Very enjoyable, being a beautifully made comedy and action anime it can make you feel the intensity of battle while also making you laugh. It has a lot of drama and sad stories so it's not always all laughs. Overall - 9/10 The beginning is bad and childish but as the audience got older so does the content, you have to tolerate the first few episodes, they are just introductions, it gets way better. Stable story with a lot left to uncover.",9,Recommended,"Sep 24, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_02e7fa6870,20
"I'm fairly new to One Piece; can't say I carry over that nostalgic feel, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. One piece's story is wonderful. It's such a broad idea and can always stay on the main story. There is rarely ever any fillers which is great. The fight scenes are awesome too. There's always tension in them, leaving you at the edge of your seat. So far (as of episode 351) I hate how no one will die. Everyone seems to live by some wonder or just lives in general despite being hit by something like a bomb millions of times. It's nothing I can't deal with of course, and I've heard it changes later on so I'm anticipating it. Personally One Piece is one of my favorites too. I highly recommend this.

"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime I've watched. The characters and story are amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites but wow. STORY The story started with an epic entrance. I've never seen a character enter the scene like that. At first he made people think that Coby was the main character because he was so focused on him, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy suddenly came out of it while shouting “that was a nice nap! ,” I was blown away because it was hilarious, but a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different islands had different uniqueness! ]CHARACTERS Each character is unique, no two characters are the same. The distribution is so big and continues to grow. Strawhat is a big family and they make me feel like I'm part of their family too. The team meets a bunch of characters, which are again - unique. I think One piece has the richest cast of characters of any anime I've watched, heard of, or will watch in the future. And again almost all of them have played or will play a big or small role in the series. ANIMATION Toei is famous for handling the One piece anime. Poor pacing and dragging an episode to the point of absurdity. But they have definitely settled down over the years. At least they did justice to this story and continue to progress episode after episode, and lately their work in Wano (Most recent arc at the time of writing this review) has been phenomenal. SOUNDTRACK Great sound effects displayed throughout the series, it even has its own songs (eg ""Bink's sake"", a really great one) and great sound effects. If you really have the will and time to invest for the number of episodes, watching One piece will not disappoint you. Trust me. It's probably THE BEST anime and the day it ends will probably mark the end of an era.",10,Recommended,"Feb 20, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_49b7c3c740,20
"I give this anime a 3. I tried watching and watching this show but no, it doesn't work. Find it way to childish. I believe people can find it enjoying to watch when they just want to disconnect sometimes but there is nothing in this show which makes it deserve a 8.3 in rating. I can explain 1 of many scenes why i find this too silly and the fights boring. There is one fight in the early episodes when they fight a clown pirate ""Buggy"". A cannon gets loaded, Zoro flips it so it is pointed towards the pirates (they are like 2 meter away). For 5 seconds they just stand there like in old cartoons, not moving and then gets shot. There is maaany more silly fights which aren't even fun to watch. If you are looking for a Adventure anime aimed for more grown up people then watch Hunter x Hunter.

"A MASTERPIECE. The plot, the characters, the action scenes, the concept, even the fillers are nice!!! I love how vast its world is and almost all types of people, powers and places are here! It It will never fail to make you laugh and cry. Unlike other Shonen animes that solves the problem by mere willpower and guts, this one's different. Lots of unexpected twists and revelations. It doesn't focus only on a one character instead its the whole crew of the Straw Hat Pirates. Every one of them gets to grab the spotlight but of course Luffy is still the has the max airtime. I guess its only flaw is that it is a BIT long but despite the number of its episodes it is definitely worth watching. I will see this anime til the end no matter how long it takes.

"Let me be clear here, I'm giving a 5/10 not to the series overall, but rather to strictly the anime. I'm dropping the anime at episode 767 and switching to the manga, never to go back. The overall series (manga) is a 9/10 to me still. Anyways, to the review: I think that we can all agree that bad adaptations suck. They make a legendary series seem like garbage due to poor translation from one medium to another. There are many issues, but one of the most common seems to be pacing. Mainly, fast pacing. It's just not feasible to fit a 100 chapters of content into a single 12 episode season. It's not possible! Story gets zoomed past episode by episode, and you're left with an extremely rushed show, since the anime covers so much content in so little time. However, of course, the original manga/LN is brilliantly paced, and had no issues of rushing. Nonetheless, the people who watch only the show think: ""Damn, this show sucks."" And rightfully so. Why was it so poorly adapted? One piece has the exact opposite problem. Holy crap, this show wants to milk out as many episodes as humanly possible. A page worth of content gets stretched to 5-10 minutes of runtime in the anime. It's ridiculous how slow paced the anime is compared to the manga. Of course, I know the reason. The anime caught up, and can only adapt a chapter at a time for each episode. That being said, have the producers ever thought of taking a break before creating some quality content? NO! One episode a week, every week, every year, no breaks. It's such a shame. Like I said earlier, it's only in the more recent years since this problem rose, since the anime wasn't always on the heels of the manga, probably at around pre time skip era. When you watch the old episodes, they aged great. The pacing is amazing, fights are more expressive, no watermelon boobs, there's actually blood when there needs to be, and there's a distinct animation style that can't be seen anymore in the ""modern"" One Piece. Alright, so pacing kind of sucks in the post time skip episodes. Do the benefits of the anime adaption make it worth it to slog over one chapter per episode? No, unfortunately. Voice acting is 10/10, but everything else is trash. OST is actually very nice, but a lot of the same ones get played over and over again, losing that special feeling when it gets played. Animation in general, but especially in fights feel extremely cheap and generic. Sound effects are terrible, you hear the same blade sound over and over again, or jump sound over and over again in quick successions, and it makes the production feel cheap. You would think that important fights would get a lot of budget, but no. Honestly, fight choreography is very generic and nothing special. The manga actually does a better job of expressing fights, and this was definitely the nail in the coffin. Sure, there's extremely rare moments in the anime where a portion of a fight is brilliantly made, but they are few and far between. Another thing to note is that the anime does not make use of CGI to animate large crowds, which is definitely a plus in my book. Sometimes these shots are just still frames, but this is far better than garbage low quality CGI, so I don't mind. And some of them are actually properly animated. The sunny is CGI'd but it's actually not so bad, and not integral to the story, so I really don't care much about that. But...if you compare this adaptation to Eiichiro Oda's work, the anime doesn't come very close. I'm not going to lie. I grew up watching this show. It was amazing. I loved it. The old episodes are still great in my mind. However, after catching up with the anime and stopping for 6 or so years, I revisited the show, anticipating quality shounen action that I was far too familiar with, but what ended up happening was me glazing through poorly paced episodes and degrading animation. I switched to manga after watching a hundred or so episodes. I will continue to do so.

"I cant make a good preview, but this is from mine Story, from the story its good when a young man wants to become a pirate king and oda sensei write the story from 1997, all the stories were unexpectedly. Like from the start of the stories oda is always giving a clue what will happen in the next episode, or the future episode. the story is good, imagine how can a 17 years old boy sailing in the sea with a small boat from his hometown, and now he got a wanted poster over hundred million. Art, honestly the art was not very good but not bad too. Sound, the sounds is good. like a punch, background sound, fighting scene, and the seiyuu they are all making a good sounds. at first i dont know if luffy was roled by a woman :D. because her sound was very deep and yeah its feel like she is a boy :/ Character, the character was very good i think. luffy is searching ""nakama"" with a passion and he was already thought how much he must get friends to sailing in the sea. His right hand and also vice captain, his navigator, sniper ( even though he is using catapult), chef, doctor, archaeologist, carpenter, musician, he is finding a different friends to making his ship better and better.

"Best story ever. So many emotions. The music is amazing. There is so much depth for this world, in every single arc. The general idea for One Piece is that it start slow and gets better and better. Every arc (except one or two) feel twice as good as the previous one, and Wano currently is just amazing. The Walk to Arlong Park is quite early on (If i remember correctly it is episode 37), and it's the first of many episodes that made me cry, I'd suggest to anyone to go at least to this part before deciding whether they want to keep watching One Piece or not.

"oh god, where to start. At first i liked it, it was my childhood fav. anime but as it aged I slowly lost my interest, but it was still enjoyable, until I caught up to the weekly uploads (in dressrosa) it started to feel like Eternity till something happens and often come out of the episode like nothing has happened. It became a habit of mine to summarise each episode after i finish watching and most of the time the summary is just a couple of words, ex: luffy hit kaido And don't get me started on the inconsistency, imagine watching a full 20 min of bad or mid animations with the goofiest sound effects and some silly side character designs that just disappear after thier arc ends and we never hear from again after they just spent the whole arc developing its character and making it the most intense drama past just so you could (or could not) find a 10 out of 10, 5 minute clip in the end of the episode. A good example of this is senior pink, goofy design, sad backstory, cool fight with franky, never saw him again. Pacing is a big problem even the studio can't fix easily even if they wanted to. But i got a suggestion to fix it, a good example of an anime adaptation, is a silly as it sounds is solo leveling. Hear me out as of right now with the only the season that aired (season 1) they already covered like 40 chapters and solo leveling chapters are much longer, but they didn't cut any content in fact they added MORE content than that of the manhwa, in the manhwa it could only be deduced (was only mentioned as text). On the other side every one piece chapter is like what, 20 pages? Even less sometimes. That's ridiculous if you need to milk a 20 min episode of those couple of pictures. I will willingly continue it despite being my most frustrating series to ever watch purely to see the ending. not saying that it is a bad series but the negative parts are currently out-weighing the good parts I will take responsibility and say that the animated one piece needs a better studio to take over, or for toei to include like 2 or 3 chapters in each episode to improve the pacing and if they needed to take more time to not catch up with the manga then that is a downside i will gladly take instead of this animation that will forever be remembered like this, so that or pass it to another studio and show it as the masterpiece as it was intended. A franchise as big as one piece will for sure get a rework that will greatly cut the number of episodes and and improve the overall quality of the show. And i will be one of the first to watch this rework.

"What can i say. One Piece is one of my favourite anime of all time due to its insanely good world building and character development. The world that Oda has built up from scratch never ceases to amaze me with its depth and ingeniousness and has me on the edge of my seat every time they introduce someplace new. The world is massive and full of different cultures and types of people, and is as diverse if not more so than real life. On the topic of character development, the arcs Oda has used to introduce different characters (my favourite of which being Arlong Park) has always explained characters backgrounds and backstories extremely well, and makes sure we have a reason to care for this character before they throw a sad story at us, which induces all kinds of emotion and interest.

"ONE PIECE: 3.4/10 Ah, One Piece. Highly regarded as one of the greatest on-going Shounen Anime to date. When coming into One Piece I expected a lot due to the praise and peer pressure I have seen from the show, and hell, the show has over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes so it must be at least decent. Man was I wrong. STORY: 2/10 First off the story, it's meh (WAY BETTER IN THE MANGA DUE TO THE PACING). Nothing special, just your average adventure/Shounen story of a boy wanting to become “the strongest” and in this case, find the mysterious “One Piece”. And man the pacing is just awful Takes forever to get anywhere in the story. It took over 30 episodes just to get the damn cook in the Straw Hats. Also the action is just straight up wack. The fights are usually ruined by the animation and there is no sense of intensity during the fights. This kinda goes along with the action aspect but the decisions characters make and story feels very childish (ESPECIALLY IN WHAT SHOULD BE A SERIOUS FIGHTS). The first couple arcs were short and sweet, but once I got to the Syrup Village arc the story started to bore me. I would say the best part about the around 90 episodes I put myself through was the Arlong Park Arc which had good twists and character development, but a decent arc in 90 episodes isn’t anything to brag about. Nothing much else to say in the department besides the story is ruined by horrendous pacing, lack of good action, and very childish actions and decisions made by almost every single character. ART: 3/10 For the time it was okay? No. It’s flat out bad. There are many awkward moments during fights, and lots of repetition in animation. It doesn’t seem lazy, but just has a lack of quality. But since it's an older show I didn’t expect much in this department. SOUND: 5/10 We Are is a good op, everything else is forgettable CHARACTERS 4/10: Man. I’m gonna get hate for this. I don’t like Luffy. Like I mentioned in the story of this review, every character is very childish in their actions all the time. All of them are annoying besides Zoro and Nami. Which have very good goals and reasons behind them, Luffy has an okay goal also but not as meaningful as Nami’s and Zoro’s. Usopp. No. Just. NO. Most of the villains were basic and pretty shallow besides like Kuro in the Syrup Village arc which I thought had a cool backstory. Other than that the only reason I give this area a 4 instead of a 1 is Zoro and Nami, the rest of the characters can piss off. ENJOYMENT: 3/10 The pacing, poor animation, and characters really ruin the enjoyment of the show for me. Nothing more to say. Overall: 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 17 17/5 = 3.4: One Piece had the potential to be amazing but as I said, poor pacing, animation, characters, and action ruined this show for me.

"One Piece, the current best selling manga series of all time and in my opinion ""The greatest shonen series to date"". Controversial this statement may be, but here me out, this review is my opinion on the one piece franchise, if you don't agree with me opinion then feel free to message me explaining why. Story: One Piece's story is overall pretty simple, Monkey D. Luffy (Main Character) wants to become the pirate king, in order to do that he needs to find the One Piece, the greatest treasure known to man that was left behind by the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger. At the beginning of the series Luffy sets out on an adventure to do just that and along the way form a pirate crew with the best members he can possibly find. The story of One Piece, along with the characters are what I believe to be the series strong points and why I think it is the best shonen series. The One Piece world is the biggest, most interesting and immersive world in anime that I can think of, you have desert islands, snow islands, women only islands, no matter where luffy ends up going you are always in for something new, fresh and interesting. That is exactly why One Piece stands above the other series such as Naruto & Bleach, it is always coming up with new ways to interest the viewer and keep them hooked. Characters: One Piece's characters in short, are some of the most developed and interesting characters in anime, every member of luffy's crew has had multiple episodes/chapters of backstory, explaining how they became who they are. This allows them to develop into new, stronger people and you get to watch that happen. Now don't get me wrong, some of the side characters don't get as much development as the straw hat pirates but there are so many characters in one piece that giving them all backstory would be nearly impossible. Another positive to One Piece characters is that each of them has a completely different personality, so there is bound to be a character that you really like and can relate to. Soundtrack: Not much I can really say about the soundtrack other than its pretty amazing, the soundtrack is full of orchestrated songs that will give you goosebumps, each song goes extremely well with whatever is happen. A pumped up song when luffy is fighting, to a calm and chilled song when something sad is about to happen, there is something for everyone. Enjoyment: This depends on the viewer, some people don't like the over the top fighting, I however think that's what makes the show fun and its one of my favorite parts about One Piece. Everyone has a different opinion on the show, some hate it, some love it, I think however that everyone can at least appreciate the show for what it is, entertainment. Overall: One Piece is a very well written, very funny and enjoyable shonen series that everyone who watches anime can at least appreciate, if you are thinking about watching or reading the series go ahead, If you make it 50 episodes in you will be hooked. Its the number 1 selling manga of all time for a reason!! :)",9,Recommended,"Jul 14, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_32feec6201,21
"(Caution: you don't have to read my foreword unless you want to, the review according to the rating starts at the ''CHRONOLOGICAL RATING:'' title) Woah! That is certainly my expression through watching the whole anime, and yet it has not ended! I am actually not sure wether I should rate it as superior or inferior to other animes. That is why I decided to make a review on my very personal level. I remember when I saw one of my tight friends in high school watching One Piece at my place (in fact this was before I even watched any animes). However I also got this flashback of my pathetic old self just sitting there in the chair next to him thinking ''WTF is this bullsh*t'' Y'know the one kind that hasn't even tried anime in his/her whole life - which means I WAS an outsider afterall, so that being said I'm definitely ready to give creds to my thankable old friend who watched One Piece while I was being stubborn.. Enough of the history about me, since it's... ...lets say ''half irrelevant'' to the review. One piece is the kind of anime not to be taken lightly. Do not understand me though, it's not a negative nor a positive statement, it's just me speaking for a more neutral side. I just need to point out that there is no such thing as ''this is the anime you should watch for the first one'' neither ''this is NOT the anime you should watch for the first time'' - as it depends highly on your own choice of categorizing. But as I'm speaking for myself, this anime had to bring down much of my time so I can recommend to plan a little better, since 'my' planning along with the animes timeline went to hell. So to simplify: One Piece is NOT beneficial if you don't have the time to watch it... well beneficial might be the wrong word but I hope you'll understand my way of thinking. CHRONOLOGICAL RATING: Story: 9 (Great) - The story made me cry several times, mostly because of the amazing family-history of the main character: Luffy, but also because you will go through all of his crew while it's holding a really epic surrounding which is also timing to the enjoyment. However I still need to point out that this might not happen to those who prefer the story background and everything to be shorter. Art: 7 (Good) - In the beginning I was almost instantly convinced that the draw quality wasn't the ace of this anime (which many anime- and manga companies choose to have). But I still need to say ''no shit'' because I realized soon enough that One Piece airing date was kind of old - which by the way gave me a really negative feeling in the start... ...Though that feeling was soon about to be erased! I probably gave it 100 episodes and the art was shining already. Because the looks didn't matter anymore - which certainly makes me want to say ''Don't judge the book by it's cover''. As I get pretty long into the anime I get to the point where the art suddenly gets even better! I'm sure all of you know the pissed-off badass'' kind of face'' of a person who is very angry yet doesn't say a word, y'know the ''state of concentration''. Well I'm glad to bring you good news because One Piece definitely has it, which is also timed according to good moments to do so (well some moments may be for the sake of comedy, but even that has it's point). So potentially speaking, the art to me is not even worth being on the rating-table because it does not even matter, as I said do not judge it by the cover because then you will most likely quit after a few minutes. Give it some time. Sound: 8 (Very Good) - Haha, one thing that for some weird reason got me was that the voice actor for the main character is a woman and not a boy. Do not let this concern you because I definitely wouldn't believe it until I saw it officially on myanimeist. No but seriously the voice acting is very good and specially the main characters in the anime(Luffys and his crew). As for the opening- and ending songs: 7 in my opinion, after hearing it in several episodes. It even approved the anime a bit and it made it more ''cosy''. Character: 8 (Very Good) - As almost being said in the art section - the characters definitely are amazing, epic, wild and yet even lovely for some weird reason. Luffy the main character of the series is bringing the best outcome of all of them, he has this really amazing and ''I don't give a fuck about superiors'' aura. I mean he can pretty much stand up to god with his expression that will make most of the supporting characters laugh! And that is also what makes his nakamas(crew) even more enjoyable, because he influences them too eventually. He will appear as dumb and retarded as well, but in the end that's just nothing compared to his badass expression when he puts up a fight among the pirates! Which will also make you smile, because his enemies or rivals will definitely first have the kind of expression ''This kid is stupid''. But as I said in the end, Luffy doesn't give a shit, he and his nakamas has this aura among them selves that says ''I've already decided to kick your ass''. Enjoyment and Overall: 6 & 8 (Fair and Good) - The enjoyment rating may come as a kind of ''Plot Twist'' in this review but to me just a single number is not a persons true feeling. ''Fair'' it says. But here is where I come in and say that One Piece still has it's up and downs. Because I gave it a lot of time, which by the way destroyed my sleep and eventually made me exhausted. Sure you can either disagree or agree with me, but let me just say it: One Piece truly was great, but at some point in this exhausted area I had... ...I truly wanted to skip a few episodes. So here is a lesson when watching One Piece: Whatever you decide, think about it. Do not force your sleep down to 6 pm. Once I was craving for sleep, the day after was like a hangover! (Only a suggestion though) If you decide to watch One Piece and love it to the end, I guess you were proving me wrong.",7,Recommended,"Dec 30, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8ac0a66fef,21
"I am actually a hard-core Fairy Tail fan and it never occurred to me I should start watching other shounens until they stopped the anime for Fairy Tail. I've been hearing alot of good reccomandations for One Piece and so I decided to give it a whirl. Story is 9, because there is not one moment you aren't on the edge of your seat or laughing like crazy. There are some filler episodes but, not too many to be irritating. Art is very good. It's classic shounen style and doesn't make all the characters perfect or powerful. In a sense it's sort of realistic. But, there are times where the art can get very wierd like, sometimes Sanji's hair is flipped right, and sometimes left. The sound is very high-quality and improves the watching experience by hundered-fold. Character is WONDERFUL. There's alot of character devolopment yet, they always surprise you. I'm only down to 210 out of 621 episodes and I hear there are more crew members coming up and only makes me more excited to watch this show. I enjoy this anime very much so far, and anyone who likes shounen anime will fall head over heels for this one.",9,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_695940320b,21
"okay, so 817 episodes... that's a lot and the beginning is quite slow, but every 100 episodes it gets faster. When i got to episode 100 I thought that it too a whole lot of time and i'm never gonna catch up, but then i got to episode 200 and I was surprised that i'm here already and around the water seven arc is where for me personally I got officially hooked to the point where i knew i was gonna watch this series to the end. The character development you get through the entire story is amazing, including the world development. the art looks kinda dumb and cartoony at first but then you get used to it and it looks amazing and the Toei animations brings out so many feelings when watching is amazing episodes 817 is a good example and episodes 278 is an older example but still fantastic. honestly this show is probably on of if not my favorite show in general, this show has made me feel for the straw hats like i was right there next to them going through all of the adventures with them, and this show is not like your typical adventure pirates show and luffy is the cause of that i'm not going to go into detail but luffy the main character is the main cause any one starts watching this show and no matter who your favorite character is you're gonna love luffy you're gonna smile when he does something that in retrospect is the dumbest thing that he could have done in that situation and still some how pull through.

IMPORTANT: Don't drop in Long Ring Long Land Arc, it seems like it will get super boring but you skip 2 episodes and you're back on track with an awesome arc after that.

"At the moment I'm writing this review, I've watched all 923 episodes and, if Oda is not trolling us, One Piece is 90% complete. I don't like this rating system, so I'm gonna write this very freely, and I ask for forgiveness if it's not totally correct, because english is my second language. So, One Piece, in my honest opinion, is a masterpiece. One Piece is the perfect example of a work in the ""adventure"" genre, much like Gulliver's Travel or Don Quixote, with a fair share of humor and drama that makes it very interesting and compelling to watch. If you lived under a rock on Mars for the last 23 years, One Piece is about Moneky D. Luffy, a 17-years old boy from a little island who wants to be the king of pirates, a title he will receive if he will be able to find the One Piece, a very famous treasure hidden by Gol D. Roger, the previous King of Pirates, years before the beginning of the story on a mysterious island. Along the way he will make friends and foes, in a story that mixes adventure, politics, mystery and action. One Piece is a masterpiece because everything is so incredibly well written and explained that, despite its incredible lenght, you can enjoy it greatly. Plot and subplots intertwine in a very intelligent way, and even the smallest character has a big background that explains not only his action, but his role in the story. Characters that are introduced very early make much later another appearence and may become very important, while others have great development along the way. The Strawhat pirates, Luffy's crew, is made of characters which are very different one from the other, and even their enemies have motives and characterizations that makes them very unique: Buggy, Blackbeard, Akainu and Donquixote Doflamingo are just four of the bad guys in this anime, and they all have their very peculiar and charismatic uniqueness. The world building and its lore are also full of details that makes the world of One Piece looking like it has its own life, a world where there is so much going on, despite the fact that you are watching ""only"" the stories of the Strawhats. On the negative side, at times the story can become slow (I will return on this later) and very difficult to continue, to the point that it is better to interrupt it and return to One Piece at a later time; also, the use of Usop and Chopper as comic reliefs is many times very frustrating: I have nothing against some childish humor at times (and also, bear in mind that One Piece was created for an audience of 12-16 years old), but there are times in which I simply sigh at their scenes, because they are not very funny or because they end up damaging the development of the character. But this is about the story, that despite some flaws, is one of the greatest thing ever produced in shonen manga/anime history. The real problem of One Piece's anime is the fact that it is incredibly rushed. Despite the fact that I have no doubt that animators and directors work incredibly hard for making it at least acceptable, at times its art is simply bad, and you can see that they have rushed many scenes, or that they are using static images for even 5-6 seconds to make the episode longer. During the Marineford saga, also, at times the recap of the previous episode last even 5 minutes, which, after an opening of at least 2 minutes and 35 seconds of anticipations, made episodes of 23 minutes last only 16-17. With the start of Wa No Kuni, they used a different art style that is very beautiful and was able to cover up some artistic flaws, but at times they resurface again, and when it happens, you can do nothing but to sigh with your head between the palms of your hands. Despite this, they care a lot about action sequences, and in fact some are really breathtaking: the fights with Enel, Doflamingo and Kaido were actually very good. Music and sound design are quite fine, even if they recycled many sound effects from other Toei Animation animes (Dragon Ball in particular) and there are times in which they feel misplaced, while the voice acting is most times very good, especially Mayumi Tanaka as Luffy, Hiroaki Hirata as Sanji and Akio Otsuka as Blackbeard. In conclusion, if you can withstand its incredible lenght and you're willing to embark on such an adventure, watching its 923 episodes (maybe without the fillers, which are more or less 100 episodes), and you like adventures, action and beautifully written characters, One Piece is for you; if not, well, at least read the manga, 'cause everybody should enjoy such masterpiece!",8,Recommended,"Feb 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_006b3d209c,21
"As of 08/07/21 One Piece is currently 986 episodes with room for at least another 300 before the series concludes. Watching One Piece is a major time investment. In the time it takes to catch up with the show you can learn to ride a unicycle, whistle, or pick up Japanese. With this in mind do I recommend One Piece? No. One Piece has some of the best moments in Shonen anime but the journey is only for the most dedicated or braindead of weebs. Sound - Sound is good. Luffy’s rubber noises, Zoro’s swords, Law’s Room, background tracks, etc are all memorable but (like most things here) can get repetitive. Voice acting is good. Art - There are three main styles; Pre-Timeskip (ep1~500), Post-Timeskip (ep500~890), and Wano (ep890~ ). Pre-Timeskip is my favorite of the three. It’s nothing crazy but overall solid. Post-Timeskip opts for a brighter color palette while making body proportions stranger across the board. Animation quality takes a significant hit and female characters get really big boobs. Wano keeps to the style of Post-Timeskip while adding more texture and fluidity to the animation. As the series progresses increasing amounts of time are dedicated to reaction shots. This is when the camera cuts to a few side characters with their mouth open in joy/surprise/fear/sadness in response to whatever just happened. These shots are barely animated, usually just some squiggles around the eye or a jaw moving up and down, and serve to pad for time. The Dressrosa arc is particularly bad with this. The camera cutting to all the tiny midget people every two minutes made me want to kill myself. Characters - One Piece characters are pretty standard. They’re not particularly deep but each fill a niche in progressing the narrative and worldbuilding while also being cool. No individual character is particularly mind-blowing but the way the series manages to keep so many of them relevant across hundreds of episodes is impressive. Story - The world of One Piece is amazing, the plot is mediocre, and the pacing is awful. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, who ate a magic fruit which turned his body into rubber, on his journey to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. The main story is broken into dozens of smaller individual arcs that tend to follow one of two patterns; a member of Luffy’s crew leaves and needs to be rescued or a country has been taken over by a pirate and needs to be saved. The rescue arcs (Arlong Park, Enies Lobby, Marineford / Impel Down, Whole Cake) are better than the nation-saving ones (Alabasta, Skypeia, Thriller Bark, Fishman Island, Dressrosa, Wano) with a few exceptions. What makes One Piece special is the power system and lore tying all these arcs together. The series’ core is a bunch of pirates who eat magic fruits and fight eachother while running from marines. Layers are added to this in the form of how people counter magic fruit usage and what type of government sponsors such an oppressive marine force. Other long-running Shonen either collapse into nonsense from a lack of foresight (Dragon Ball Z / Super) or morph into something entirely alien from the original concept (Naruto) but One Piece has been building up its core for 20+ years. The magic fruit system has evolved to the point where it can stand toe to toe with the nen system of Hunter x Hunter or the alchemy of Full Metal Alchemist. Ideas are set up in the first season that pay off 900 episodes in the future. Which is all very cool. Unfortunately getting to episode 900 is an absolute slog. Early seasons are fun but because the anime releases one episode per week the pacing is gradually throttled to a crawl to avoid catching up with the manga. The majority of episodes past 500 feel like watching a highschool presentation where the student has some good ideas but didn’t prepare and is just stalling for time until 30min of class ends. Conclusion - A 5/10 anime with occasional flashes of genre-defining brilliance. 6/10",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 7, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d9b7f46446,21
"I'm about 700 episodes in, and still watching, but I can't recommend this anime to anyone. There are lots of reviews that paint a picture of why this anime is so good, so I'll skip over that (those reasons are valid) and highlight why I can't recommend this anime. I'll speak in general terms and avoid spoilers for the most part. The pacing is wearisome, to say the least. It's so slow, in fact, that for the average arc has a higher number of episodes than source chapters. For example, the Dressrosa arc is 101 chapters in the manga, and 117 episodes in the anime. One Piece as a manga already has a fairly slow pace, so having every chapter stretched out over 24 minutes (less than 19 typically if you discount the intro and recap every episode) really draws it out. Ultimately the problem is the serialization and weekly deadlines: the pressure to produce a chapter (and later an episode) every week forces the author to use less detail, outsource, and draw out sequences and the story overall. We've seen this issue in Naruto, Dragon Ball, and of course, One Piece. One Piece is a product of the environment it's created in, and that environment is one that demands a chapter and an episode every week, one that demands a quantity but not quality. Because of this, One Piece as an anime has loathsome pacing: often reusing animations, drawing out already drawn-out sequences, using unnecessary and drawn-out flashbacks, and a large amount of recap, and a small amount of filler arcs. For an idea of pacing, the aforementioned Dressrosa arc is 117 episodes, with one episode every week coming out to 2 1/4 years. This arc is canon but it's importance to the overall progression of the story (the group's circumnavigation of the world, search for the One Piece, and Luffy's goal to become King of the Pirates) is not proportional to its length. Ultimately Dressrosa is not much more than an obstacle in the path of our heroes, the ultimate villain of the arc is ultimately a subordinate of a greater villain. There is important story developments throughout the arc, don't get me wrong, but again, the length of the arc hugely outsizes its overall importance to the story. Most story arcs are like this; the heroes defeat a villain, only to have that villain rapidly replaced by a greater villain in the same or similar role. Overall this pacing diminishes all the other positives of the anime, making it impossible to recommend. I will continue to watch it, but mostly because I have invested ~700 episodes worth of time into it (it's kind of a curse). I find this anime is best watched in the background while you do homework or something that requires a moderate amount of attention, kind of like a Twitch livestream or something. I often watched unpausing/pausing it while playing GTA Online due to the game's large amount of time spent traveling between points. Other than that I don't recommend it. If you're a fast enough reader try the manga instead.",4,Not Recommended,"Oct 17, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_42ba2b123a,21
"One piece is another well respected and ambitious shonen series especially in Japan. It is currently the leading crown jewel of shonen in its home country and the most popular manga in the world. Believe me if there is any shonen series out there that deserves this recognition, it is one piece. Helmed by Eiichiro Oda himself, the author of one piece has a level of commitment and confidence to his manga that you don’t often see in many mangaka’s careers. One by one Naruto, bleach, fairy tail, hitman reborn, magi. They all fell apart at some point, usually towards the often unplanned or convoluted climax of a story. Or some shonen adapted works become too reliant on typical standardized tropes that often are unexecuted and not consistently planned leading to plot holes. One thing all large ongoing shonen have in common is they are plagued by inconsistency both in the writing and themes and elements presented. This is a growing trend that is predominant in this genre. This is where one piece greatly improves the formula on a level I have honestly never seen before within Shonen. This series really opened my eyes on the same level as like Hunter X hunter did. The plot is about adventures and pirates sailing the seas’, meeting new exotic locations with new belief systems, ideologies, races of different cultures and exploring deeper stories behind each of these locales all with different solutions and consequential problems to solve for our protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw hat crew. It’s a world filled to the brim with uniqueness, diversity, colorful abstract themes at every corner and even philosophical notions with a touch of heroism in poetic motion which is so unique to oda’s style of immersing you into the experience and helps to establish your connection to these characters and the story presented. The series has some of the most inventive and well-developed cast of characters with tragic but also drama fueled dramatic backstories along with a very deeply crafted and Imaginative expansive world just full of beauty. One piece never feels like its derailing off track or contradicting its written code that is the mechanics and rules written that dictate the structure of the series and its universal principles outlined by the author. This sets the foundation of the many hundreds of episodes and continues along consistently with those established elements. (An example would be something like how Dragon ball and Dragon ball Z differ greatly from being a series about classic adventures and down to earth conflict with a focus more on comedy and slapstick to galaxy type cosmic battles of destruction and a clash of superpowers. Now granted I love Dragon Ball Z for a lot of reasons but one can argue that it some times truggles with trying to find its middle ground in terms of the audience and its source material.) This is something that does not happen with one piece. Characters do grow more powerful as the series progresses, but it’s confined with-in the rules established and never breaks that barrier feeling like a deconstruction towards a different series. Each individual character be it main, secondary or even villains will go through lots of emotional and physical development and the scaling is maintained and well balanced, never giving you the insinuation that there is any sort of absurd power curves or as most fans put it “ass pulls” come with out warning. One of the largest reasons why I have such hope that the ending of one piece will be great, because this man has mapped out and has drawn the final arc of the story from literally two decades ago and has since dropped the breadcrumbs often hinting or leaving subtle clues that tie and connect seamlessly to some of the deepest mysteries of the plot. In short you can feel that the show is building towards something with many lingering questions and answers that will eventually come to the forefront of this epic saga. I swear I have seen this show a lot and I am still picking up on certain foreshadowing that was conveyed literally hundreds of episodes ago which later became a huge plot point. This man plans so meticulously, that it literally boggles your mind and to be able to achieve that for a serialization as long as one piece is just... Unbeliable! Oda enjoys exploring things with such subtly, it feels like this man knows exactly what is on the horizon and loves to throw in such amazing Easter eggs to see if viewers are really paying attention. This is also another reason why this series has a huge following of theorists and analytical reviewers. In terms of the art and style. The diverse and rich universe that oda creates with some of the most impressive world building and the ability to establish each new locale with different laws, cultures, morals, rules, etc. The often-exaggerated display of facial expressions and abnormal designs can turn some people off but if you look above that exterior you will notice a unique style that is not used in any other anime with such a wide range of variety that is often hard to interpret just from mere words. Objects and characters represented in the one piece world are often large in scale and tower over the main protagonist in a way that makes you feel their dominance and control that the one piece world is full of such monsters and incredibly powerful adversaries. The significance to this design choice by oda is amazing and really exemplifies the massive threat level conveyed in this world. The anime actually makes this element of the series more prevalent. Also, the type of scale the one-piece world has is unprecedented. You will never see a world with such rich lore and world building and oda gets a lot of his ideas from so many other novels, movies, real world and fictional historical references, etc. So, there is bound to be something that you will recognize from other iconic anime or films. Things like Alice in wonderland, the god father, Dragonball, Moby dick, to name a few. Don't be put off by the often-classic style of animation if you’re watching the anime, because it will evolve over time. Obviously with a show that has started in the early 1990's and is continuing into 2022 will have some changes in terms of art quality and animation. Seeing the transition to 16:9 is where you can really see the massive difference. The Music deserves a mention in this series. Without it, it would not be the same. The music suits the scenes of battle marvelously, it gives the people who's watching seeking for more and more action. The orchestrated trumpets and trombones, mixed with the drums fit the action scenes very nicely and the piano themes that you hear during some of the drama, really creates a powerful scene that is trying to bring out your emotion and just tingles your heart and soul. You really do feel for these characters as almost living in their world. Believe me, you will cry, you will laugh, and you will even get angry during some of the more intense dramatic moments in this show. The background music is also very capable of strengthening suspenseful or triumphant moments. There is just something about it that fits the story of pirates sailing to sea so well. Additionally, you may become so attached to the main cast, that even considering the prospect of our heroes dying at some point, would absolutly devestate you. I have never in my entire anime career been more attached to a cast of characters like the Straw hat Pirates. With that all being said, I just want to say that one piece is not an episodic type of series, it is a massive serialization with an overarching narrative, but the core of the series is structured differently than Naruto for example. The series is a more of a character driven narrative and the mystery and lore take kind of a back seat for a while. There is a common misconception where people perceive this series as being very slow paced for that reason and the story does not move to the end goal any time soon but as i said, the driving force of the story is the characters them self's well the mystery and lore are conveyed throughout the journey. Eventually It will come full circle and you will just be in awe at how carefully planned out the plot really was by the ending. You can witness the many clues and hints outlined throughout the plot and details early on that have a groundbreaking significance later in the story. In closing to say I know most people are turned off by it because of how intimidating it can be with its nearly 1000 episodes and nearly 1100 chapters of content and still on going. But rest assured this is not pokemon, it is a deeply well developed and expansive story with rich lore and world building and it’s about journeys, adventure and mystery that will captivate the audience and become a spell binding experience that will sure to intrigue you to no end.

"~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This review is for those who think ""one piece is shit and think one piece is too long, so who's gonna watch it"".. anyways, i have given episode guide in the last. :-) PLOT: 10/10 among all the animes i have seen, One piece has the biggest plot among them all, the vastness of one piece plot is beyond measure as compare to other animes. Character Development: 9/10 (TO EACH TO THEIR OWN) Character development of one piece character is Dope. It's like when they are visiting new places, they are learning new things and understanding new people's feeling and learning about the truth of world government and crimes and injustice in this world. One thing i like the most about the theme of one piece is ""They don't follow the rules, they make their own rule"". + one piece contains upto 500 characters and each one have their own character development. It's not just about hero being punching everyone in his way, they all have their own character development. Characters information: Monkey.D Luffy: (8/10) (Main character) Well.. About Luffy.. He's an idiot (no doubt :D ) but there are times when he made decisions which totally describes that why he's the captain in his crew and why others are not, despite the fact that each member of his crew have more intellectual level than luffy. ""Sure.. He's an idiot, but that's why he's our captain."" ~Zoro Roronoa Zoro: (10/10) A badass three sword-style user swordsman and right hand of luffy. Though he have a bad sense of direction (almost too bad) but his morale value are way too much ! He is one of those character which will make you hooked to the one piece and loyal to it. (not gonna say much about him to avoid spoilers) Nami: (8/10) Navagator of the crew who has lust and greed for money. Probably the heroin of one piece (not luffy's fiance though, not even close). Usopp: (7/10): Usopp the sharp shooter (LOL exaggerated,) or should i say , ""Usopp the Lier"". Sanji (10/10): Cook of the straw hat pirates, who only uses legs in fight. (pretty badass ain't it?) (not including other characters to avoid spoilers). OST: 7/10 Ost are decent , not gonna say they are awesome but some ost will make goosebumps .. <3 Opening/Ending song: 7/10 they are decent. For example: you can listen to ""oh we share the music"". Pacing: 6/10 Now this is the major weak point of one piece. The pacing of one piece is quite slow. Animation: 6/10 the reason why people say that one piece sucks is not because of the story, or the plot , or the character, it's the animation studio a.k.a toei animation that sucks. well the animation .... well to be precise: animation isn't on par with the dope plot and character development of one piece. (Well it keeps getting better and better though) It's still better than naruto though :3 Gore: 6/10 blood is quite shown in this anime but not like ""cutting in half, ripping head off"" etc Fights: 9/10 THEY ARE DOPE. Overall enjoyment: 10/10 believe me, once you are hooked to one piece, you can't stop watching. I'm not a one piece fan boy , I just state the facts. I was the same as you guys who didn't watch one piece but said it's shit .. but ! after watching it my review completely changed! Episode guide: So , what scares people the most is the amount of episodes of one piece which is 783 up to date (quite long though). and when people start watching early episodes they say "" this anime is not that good the way it is hyped"" well How can you judge an anime which has 700+ episode by watching 10 to 20 episode? it's not even it's 10% episode ! so I'm gonna rate one piece episodes so that you can understand and make up your mind while watching it. Episode List: 1 to 50: (6/10) 50 to 220: (7/10) 226 to 370: (8/10) 382 to 491: (10/10) (yes! it's a 10/10) 493 to upto date: (9/10) Keep these ratings in mind while watching one piece.",9,Recommended,"Apr 9, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_535c067fc8,21
"Story For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. Animation Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. Sound Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). Characters Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. Overall Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time where One Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.",10,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eadd5f72cc,21
"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, a twelve year old girl (me) was new to Anime, and wanted to get into it. She stumbled across One Piece, and since she had nothing better to do, she binged watched it and absolutely adored it. But, then the fanbase started to get pretty violent, and the episodes airing at the time were dragging out a bit too long, so she decided to drop it for a while. During the year while she was gone, she discovered different Anime. Shows she actually enjoyed more than One Piece. And thus, returning to One Piece after the fandom had calmed down, after watching new shows that were mature and moving, she realized something she never knew. This show sucks. It sucks really bad. Story: Every cliche shounen show you can name. No really, just think about any shounen anime, and the first things that come into your mind are there. We've got the childish idiotic protagonists, we've got the overly eccentric girl who hits said protagonists because he's stupid, we've got the dark broody badass with a heart of gold, you can pretty much name everything that's going to happen before it happens. Art/Animation: The animation for the first 100 episodes was fine, for the most part. But in the newer episodes, it just looks so glossy and lazy. It actually hurts my eyes. Sound: The music is fantastic. Really, just get the soundtrack for this thing, it's the only thing that's worth it. Character: Very, very poor. Everyone's just your stereotypical Dragon Ball rip-off. Luffy = Goku, Nami = Bulma, Zoro = Piccolo, Sanji = Vegeta, Usopp = Krillin, Chopper = Chiaotzu, Robin = #18, ect. Enjoyment: None. It was enjoyable up to the Arlong Park arc. After that, it just got boring. Each episode is 20 minutes, and they waste most of that time with themesongs and recapping of the show's plot, and the previous episode. And the time that they do spend is wasted on filler, and the characters just standing around and talking. WHY THE FUCK DID I EVER LIKE THIS SHIT!!?????? Overall: Why am I giving this a 5 when I just tore it apart? Well, I do kind of still have a soft spot for it, as it used to be my favorite show, and it was what introduced me to Anime. And I used to like it because I was, like, 12, and I hadn't seen too many Anime at the time. So, if you have a 12 year old kid with you, show it to them if they wanna see something, it's harmless. Or, if you're new to Anime and you wanna see a shounen show, then go ahead and check it out if you want. It's harmless enough. But really, the only reason this show is so popular is because its fanbase is just a bunch of twelve year olds who like cliche shounen stuff, and 21-year-olds who're just as immature as the kids. Believe me, I've been in this fanbase. So, just get up to the Arlong Park arc, and just stop. Trust me, it's not worth it. If you want something original that's mature and relatable, instead of childish and tossing in backstories that's just a bunch of people dying, then I'd suggest giving it a skip.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b00ac1e481,21
"When it comes to One Piece, there are two kinds of people. The first ones, obviously, are the people who hate the guts of this anime. Second ones are who love it to the core. There's virtually nothing in between. Let me tell you. For the ones who watch the first few episodes and go on telling stories like ""Oh it's not even worth it. I watched 5 episodes and I'm done"". You missed out on an amazing journey. It's like the saying ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Even when the book has 800+ chapters!). The first few episodes can only be expressed as part of the cover. Shit gets real once you get a hang of the later episodes, like during Arlong Park Arc. After that, you're put on an amazing journey, with lots of enjoyment, character development, feels and much more. And if you ask me, One Piece actually has one of the best character development plots I've seen. I do admit though, scrolling through some other reviews, I saw the criticism on how almost all characters never really die, no matter how hard they get hit. I do agree with that. But at the same time, this element isn't of too much importance if you ask me ._. So for those of you who give One Piece a bad review at first sight, I advice you. Give it a try, and you'll love it.

"I had started watching/reading One Piece in early February of this year and it is an amazing watch. As I had not watched this as a kid, this will not be biased and won't be clouded with 4kids terrible dub or nostalgia. Story: 9/10 The story for one piece is very interesting, unique and big. Oda has done an amazing job with providing really great stories across each arc, each with its own feel and style. While at first before the grand line the story might come as underwhelming, it gets alot better. Around Arlong Park is their I personally got hooked watching it. Alot of the arcs is unique when it comes to its plot and is a great journey with the crew. Their is some complaints though. Some events are stretched longer than it should be and rushing in others, but overall the journey and thrill of the story is great. Art: 7/10 The art of the show is a hit or miss at times. At times the show looks great considering the length of the series but at times, takes a noticeable hit where their would be low frames, alot of still shots and disproportionated characters. Overall the art is good, but not great. Sound: 8/10 If it was purely for the soundtrack of the show itself, this would easily be a 9/10. Each song is unique and fits Into the show and the events that are taking place throughout the show. With orchestra level songs to truly sad piano music to jazzy blues, the music is great, though often repeats itself, is great. However, the sound effects itself are okay. While their is alot of good sound effects like specific character sound effects to luffys arm stretching, it's quite iconic. Their is alot of sound effects that are quite cringeworthy and too childish for me. Often only have 1 or 2 variations of the sound, Toei would often play the sound effect way too much and be quite annoying. Characters: 8/10 The characters in One Piece are great, with a variety of memorable characters, especially in the straw hats crew. Alot often having deep and pronounced back stories and with unique charactistics that are enjoyable to watch. Even the villains, often with interesting motives and personalitys. If I had one gripe with the show/manga, Oda often has a lot of of pretty much unmemorbale, serving little to no actual purpose in the show besides making an event longer than it should be. The Characters are a great aspect of the show. Enjoyment and Overall Conclison: 9/10 Overall, the show is great and though the show is quite lengthy and has its faults, the journey and story is amazing and should be enjoyed. I absolutely adored the character development and variety of locations the crew explores and the variety of characters they meet along the way. I recommend the show highly of you give it the time as it's a great show to watch and make you want to watch more alot of times.",9,Recommended,"Nov 25, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_87aeb02d05,22

"PLEASE READ FIRST: I have not yet caught up on One Piece so my review is only for the first 141 episodes. Think of it as a first impression if you want. I'll rewrite my review every 150 episodes or so. Please don't get anal on me if you don't agree with this review, like i said, it's only for the first 141 episodes. I have not written many reviews so constructive criticism is always more than welcome. Lemme just start off by saying if you have not yet started watching One Piece because you're intimidated by its size i would highly recommend starting it just to get a feel for it. It has definitely earned it's right to popularity. Plus you can always take it slow, there's no need to rush an anime if you don't have the time or ability to rush it. As for me i'm taking it pretty slowly, it took me three weeks to get to episode 141 and i've been taking a break from it for the past month but i will start watching again soon. Story 8/10 One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy who is a some what dumb witty pirate on a quest to find the greatest treasure in the world, the One Piece, and become the Pirate King. You get to watch how Luffy gathers his own crew (nakama), gets his own ship and fight for nakama power. That pretty much sums up the amount of story i've seen so far. I gave the story an 8/10 because i did feel that it was very good and it gives the anime huge possibilities. Especially since this is a long time running shounen, the amount of arcs and character development they can do is almost endless. Thankfully there actually has been a decent amount of character development. I really can't wait to catch up to the series and honestly i've always loved pirates as a kid so when i heard there was an anime about pirates that was over 600 episodes i was like ""oh hell yea!!"" Only reason i took a break was because the pacing of the anime was just too god damn slow. Like the fight between luffy and Mr. 3 in the alabasta pre arc... omg no. too slow so no thx you. This is my main problem i have for the story, Oda Eiichiro is a genius but his pacing can be almost unbearable at times. My second problem is all the arcs so far have been extremely predictable. It basically goes like this; Luffy and his crew would go fight the bad guy and the bad guy's crew, they would beat up all the unimportant grunts of the crew and then there would be a few enemies that were actual threats and they would have to fight with Luffy's crew. Then when it was time to fight the main bad guy, everyone would wait for Luffy to come and kick his ass. That pretty much explains every arc so far. :/ Art and Sound 8/8 The art was pretty good for being as old as it was, i can't really complain to much because as One Piece progresses you'll begin to notice the art also progresses with the series. Nothing too impressive yet but i'm sure as i catch up i'll start to see the higher quality of the art and animation. The sound was pretty good, not too many memorable songs so far but there are one or two in there. That does not mean they don't have good songs! One Piece has songs that fit the situations they're placed in but unlike Fairy Tail or Magi the sound track doesn't really stick to me. Character 10/10 Yes, 10/10 for the characters, Luffy is hilarious, he's honest and even though he's some what dumb, he has a true love for his nakama. Most people don't like nakama power in anime but i for one love nakama power, if it's a shounen and it doesn't have nakama power than it just doesn't feel right when i watch it. Obviously that's just my opinion, i know a lot of people hate nakama power with the passion but as a kid till now i've always believed in the powers of nakama. I like Zoro's character too because he's a total bad ass. He has three swords and he tears up every body with them. Nami is cool because even though sh'es useless in a fight, she's useful in like everything else from navigating to operating the ship. Usopp can go to hell. Chopper is amazing and i actually haven't got to the character development for nico robin yet so i really don't know too much about her so i can't say anything about her yet. Enjoyment 9/10 I really really enjoyed this anime. It's funny and has a good feel to it when i watch it. It has a lot of nakama power and a good amount of action in it. The situations The Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in are hilarious. If only it wasn't for the pacing of this anime i would have rated it a 10 for my enjoyment. Cause honestly i can tolerate the predictability of the anime but slow pacing is a no go! Especially for longer series. Overall 8/10 This is an anime that should definitely be watched by everyone. For the most part it's very good, the story is very original, and like i said before Oda is a genius. One Piece has a snowballing effect so the more you go the more it builds up and it will eventually turn to this giant masterpiece of snow and amazement.. that is very predictable with terrible pacing haha. No seriously though, i'm glad i started it.",8,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4b43000690,22

"Look, One Piece as a franchise is fantastic. Good story, great characters, entertaining fights and a nigh unparalleled world. The problem is that adaptations sometimes don't do justice to the source material, and One Piece is by far the best example of this. I started watching the anime about 2 months after finishing the manga, and after forcing myself through 40 episodes of terribly paced, poorly animated (even for the time) slop I had to quit. Once when I watched it late at night I literally fell asleep because so little happened in each episode, EVEN after skipping the mandatory 5 minute recap on top of the intro and outro (only just over half of each episode is actually new content.) Even this content which should be enjoyable is ruined by egregiously long pauses, shots of character reactions, flashbacks and anything Toei animation can do to save a buck, because they know that however badly they treat the anime it'll still be one of the most popular in the world thanks to the franchises overwhelming popularity.

"SPOILER FREE Many people are deterred because of how long this anime is. I was too. And hearing about the pacing issues did not help its case. However after hearing about One Pace* I decided it would be a good way to at least give the show a go. I started watching two weeks ago and thanks to One Pace drastically cutting down on time I managed to get 350 episodes deep in this short time frame. How good is the actual show? Well I can't say for the full thing obviously, but from what I've seen and heard about future arcs, the show is FANTASTIC. I've been loving it so far. *What is One Pace?

"****DISCLAIMER******** This is my opinion, it doesnt mean mine is right or wrong, its just what i think of the series ********************** Hello there, I think i speak for most of us when i say that one piece is one amazing piece of fiction. Ofcourse there are ups and down in one piece, but every show has that, still thats no excuses to justify the flaws, I will give you my take on the work of Eiichiro Oda. PLOT: 10/10 What a surprise, another one piece fan has geven the plot a ten, he's just like all the others that say the plot is just amazing. Let me explain Our story starts off with a boy namen luffy. Ok not to special, he beats up some fat woman, then saves a pussyboy and continues to beat up more Peoeple, he geïnstalleerd others to beat up People with him. Thats bassically the plot of one piece, well thats actually not really True, the thing about the plot of one piece is that its verry deep, disturbing and quite the emotional rollercoaster, but yet it remains funny, goofy and verry childish. I think this is a part that many people dont realise thats really impresive, Very few can make the combination of those work. The story might start off a bit slow, but it really grabs you during arlong park in my opinion, this is the fisrt time where you see things that you dont often see in other anime, i think the nami scene is a perfect example. I also really like the fact that oda isnt affraid to make his series lenghty, it gives you more emotional connection with the story, ofcourse this isnt for everyone, i can unstanf that a thousend episodes is a burden to watch ans that it can really demotivate people, but in my opinion you get high value for youre time. I think its a good thing that you can go really in dept about the plot, i really like that because that makes one piece a big world to explore. I also really like the fact that the villains come back. I think that makes for a better world building wich one piece is in my opinion the best in. I alsp really like the fact that the plot is yet complicated, but simple. There are maybe 5 plotholes at maximum in one piece, this is also verry pleasant. That makes the plot more consistent. I also really like the emotional storys of the characters we follow, there verry tragic and i quite like that. It makes you feel more empathy for a certain character and you most of the times understand why a certain character does thing because of it. CHARACTERS 10/10 I really love the characters of one piece, there verry well thougt trough of and surprisingly verry well writen, for a series thats for children it has very detailed characters, this makes you able to feel more emotions for a certain character. I really like this, i also really like that all of the characters are unique in their own way, you could evem sympethise for some of the villains. Take hanyaball for example, at first he looks like a lazy piece of shit that only wants a higher position, but trough out impel down he has shown to change and even stood up when facing an impossible challange. One piece really does a amazing job at making characters. There childish yet so mature. Its really fascinating to see in my opinion. OTHER ASPECTS: Lets talk about the other aspects of one piece. I really like the childish artstyle, it just makes me feel more at home. I also lkke the current animation, the only thing i dont like is the use of cgi. Its just quite alot and certainly in latest episodes. I was really dissapointed to see cgi ships and kaido in the gear 5 episode. I really like the music in one piece, i think overtaken does its job perfectly. It gives alot of hype when you hear it play, im always at the edge of my seat whenever i hear this banger play. The intros are fine, there not the best and not the worst, a thing that deffinetly worst is the pacing in one piece anime, the manga has good pacing but the anime, my god, its like going to a lecture about grass, its verry slow and i think toei should really improve in this department, it makes the series feel so much worse than it actually is, fortunatly theres one pace, this fixes a huge chunk of the pacing problem, this doenst mean that toei cant be blaimes for the horrible pacing. Overall i think that one piece is an amazing piece of fiction, i would really recommend it to people who want to go on the ride of their lifes. It has everything and it does it all amazingly. My final rating of one piece so fat is a 9.5, if one piece was only anime it would be a 6 because the pacing is just horrible. If anyone likes to point out things, i'll gladly have a discussion with you about the topic. Many thanks to the people taking the time to read my review, im really sorry if theres alot of gramar mistakes, english isnt my native language and my spelling is horrible, yet i hope this was bearable to read.",9,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e5de31a4e6,22

"this is one of the best animes it has alot of stories derived from many legends and characters that are also taken from iconic people and the plot twist are just awesome and thought through ,and it has alot of unanswered questions though it is in 800+ episodes but the stories and the why they are told is really satisfying and feels great but one thing that most viewers must understand about this anime is that it is ok to skip some fillers episodes maybe come back to them later if you want but i remember when i started watching this anime there where about 643 episodes i only watch this anime for month to 2 months tho i didn't skip most of the episodes but you could do that. so this is my only complain: one piece is the greatest anime in the story ,character design and plot twists but the only ccomplain i have is that it has alot of fillers alot of episodes that is there just to add the num er of episode side tracking some times it take 4 episode for some one to do something that we all are waiting for and is just like moving 1 inch to open the door for example which is frustrating . so if they make an version with out that bullshit that will be great ... WOULD I RECOMMEND IT : YES, of course you woukld be missing out alot of stuff that you would never get from hundreds of thousands of any other anime episodes.... BUT, i encourage you to SKIP EPISODES WHEN THEY ARE JUST FILLERS , there are many websites which tell you if this episode is a canon episode or just another filler .",10,Recommended,"Sep 28, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4713f57936,22
"One piece is possibly one of the best shows i've seen in quite some time. While the art style doesn't fit my taste initially, The show spans over 20 years. And you can see that in the anime as the art style evolves and gains a flash. The story is centered around a small crew, Lead by the maincharacter, Monkey D. Luffy, With what on the surface seems like a simple goal and simple ideals. But as you go on you see how he has been changed by many things in his life, And this sort of care extends to his crew. All of them have their own stories, Ideals and dreams. The music in this show is amazing. From character themes to openings and endings, All amazing musical scores. While the show right now is more and more difficult to watch with it taking over 300 hours straight to complete the series up to it's current count at the time of this review.

"One piece review! (as of episode 710) =SPOILERS CONTAINED= - Synopsis - To this day Luffy, A little boy who ate the Gum-Gum fruit is on an adventure to find the one piece! A show centered around its amazing characters, and amazing world building, I feel it deserves my time for a review! This show, on where I am currently standing is at 710 of 851 episodes. My name is Seigyoku, and this is my thoughts on one piece! -plot/story- 8/10 The story is about a boy, named Luffy who had grown up with his brothers Ace and Sabo with a bandit mountain gang. Sometime after Luffy has decided to start his journey as a pirate! He has met many friends along the way. The story is undoubtedly fantastic, the show gives me a sense of adventure and I feel like I'm with Luffy all the way on this journey. An example of this is when Luffy comes to the arlong park arc. When I first started this arc, it didn't impact me at first, but later in the story during the Fishman Island arc, it amazed me on how far ahead the story could be planned. it takes skill to be able to organize a chronological story while managing it on a weekly manga basis. as for the backstory arcs, they are worthwhile, rich with a story it leaves you satisfied on knowing the events of what happened. I'd say an amazing backstory example is Law's backstory. It showed how much it can change a person, it felt like I was suffering with Law during the whole thing. On the back of Law's coat that he wears, it says the person name who saved him, which is amazing. it leaves me speechless to know everything has a meaning in this show, and the plot is just about perfect. - characters - 9/10 This anime does characters in a unique way, that makes it stand out from other shows. This being a long-running shounen series, It gives the opportunity to build characters up, and make you really attached to them. A good example would be Usopp on the arc of Water 7 Island. The arc was mainly focused around Robin, but even other characters were brimming with rich interaction with the story. Usopp loved the ship of the straw hat pirates it was from his hometown built by one of his most loved. I could feel the pain from Usopp when he reacted to the news of the ship being unsalvagable. He had pride with the ship, and when he heard Luffy's decision his pride and love for the ship made the two have a serious clash which was the highlight of the water 7 arc in my opinion. Usopp is my favorite character because he used to be such a self-doubting person, and that's why he lied most of the time, to cover that up. In the show, he learns to overcome that self-doubt during that arc. He thinks back on the mistakes he has made and wants to fix them, and it shows that he has matured a lot, he still is cowardly, yes that's just his nature. -Art/Animation- 6/10 Now, this is probably my most liked part of the entire show, I apologize to the hardcore fans. This show was demanded on a weekly basis, so I can see why it was struggling with consistency on the animation subject. It just felt like I was looking at a painting sometimes if you want an analogy. Which somewhat threw off the immersive feeling of the show. Not all apples are rotten, there were some amazing scenes, such as mihawk slicing a massive ship clean in half it had so much detail in the scene I couldn't keep my eyes still, but for the majority of the show, it was lacking in some aspects. Now as for the art, it was unique in some arcs, I really liked the look of marineford, it had this feeling that it had the embodiment of the safety of the world and it had such an interesting design. The fact that there were so many characters it was amazing on how consistent the art stayed natural, even less significant characters looked good. -music- 7/10 The music was pretty darn good. The walk to Franky house and hearing that song of the straw hat pirates literally doubled the adrenaline and excitement I was feeling, and some of the soundtracks that really gave it that vibe of it being a monumental event. The death of whitebeard gives me chills when they were naming the casualties and the music that was playing helped with that a lot. So yeah the music was a good impact on the immersive feeling of the show. -final thoughts- overall score: 8/10 I do not regret watching this show, it was worth the time, and thank you Toei animation for orchestrating such a masterpiece, the world loves you for all the joy you have brought to the anime community, this is seigyoku, and this has been my review on one piece, Sayanora!",8,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e0786b60f4,22
"-Edited September 2023- First of all, I love One Piece's story possibly more than any other fictional narrative. I have grown up with this series, following it through my teenage years as well as my 20s. For every major plot development in the serialization I can remember where I was in my life. Needless to say this series has had an immensely powerful influence over my personal development, giving me motivation during high points and moments of ambition in my life, and encouraging me during low points in my life to keep fighting. However, these thoughts refer to the core narrative and characters of One Piece, not necessarily the animation by Toei Animation Studios. In all honesty, I still tend to recommend the first half of the series. The episodes are decently animated (albeit with a certain stiffness that gives them a unique, nostalgic charm), decently paced, and have decent sound design. The core narrative remains true to Eiichiro Oda's original manga work, and quality of the storytelling remains consistent. However, at around episode 500 the quality of the series begins to tank, and it is truly jarring. I simply cannot recommend this anime in its current form to those who are seeking consistency in the quality of an animation, and I daresay most true fans would agree. The pacing has become an irreconcilable issue in both the long-term and short-term storytelling. Chapters of the manga are spread out over several episodes, forcing the production teams to pad every episode with extended scenes of characters running, or thinking to themselves, or simply just standing still in a single, panning frame of animation. Fight scenes and impacts which are sometimes a single frame in the manga are now extended to seem like a ""tug of war"" in power, which kills tension. The animation quality varies wildly, with some scenes being enduring examples of incredible artistic direction by notable animators (search ""One Piece sakugo on YouTube), and other scenes looking like the animators drew them in their sleep. Finally, the sound design is completely stagnant. They have used the same sounds for footsteps and gunshots for the past 23 years - literally from episode 1. There's one sound effect in particular that plays when a character has a vein popping out on their head that literally just sounds like mustard squirting from a bottle. Even the current arc which was marketed as being a ""redesign"" of the anime art style still suffers from the atrocious pacing and stagnant sound design that plagued the last 300 episodes. On top of this, the current arc (as of 2023) has used 3D animation for the villain in what I can only assume is a way to cheat having to animate a character with a non-human form. All I can I do is shake my head. I love One Piece so much, but the anime deserves better than what Toei Animation Studios have turned it into. The Netflix live action is pretty sick tho.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_61f25fe0a5,22
"More character & plot development in a single arc than most anime series have throughout their entire run. Sometimes this series suffers a bit from the deadly ""Bleach-itis"" (a good show that is kept alive on a steady IV stream of filler arcs that serve very little to move the actual overall plot forward), but even then it's not TERRIBLE, and fortunately these arcs are not ALWAYS these monolithic full season filler arcs. But I would recommend finding a filler avoidance guide nonetheless. Boa is top-tier waifu material, not for her looks, but because she is hardcore ride or die, ready to take on the whole world for Luffy. Fuck you.

"I started watching One Piece on a whim to find out why it appeals people so much, and as soon as the first opening rolled, it pulled me inside its world. One Piece's biggest selling point is that it has some of the best world building in all of anime. It pulls you so much into its world when it shows you the Navy and the World Government doing its stuff, and the other pirates reacting to the biggest blunders of the Straw Hats. Some characters in this show just radiate so much charisma that you automatically respect them if you're passionate about the show such as Gol D. Roger. The arcs in the story are structured to be such that they can be independent, and at the same time have an impact on the overall story. Even though the anime has been criticized because of it's slow pacing and at times bad animation too, there are still reasons to watch the anime such as great animation at other times and a beautiful OST. The cartoonish artstyle of the anime is actually very helpful for its storytelling.",10,Recommended,"Oct 22, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3fe64e0c84,22

It has the simple adventure feeling for the younger generations and much deeper layers and humor for the more mature age. Storyline flows, even when there is filler materials in the anime it is still fluently written and the more you see and read the more you are sucked into the adventure with the main crew.

One Piece, however, made me cry a waterfall over a ship. Yes, a ship. Some tips to help you enjoy One Piece better: - do NOT watch 4Kids dub, and also sub is much preferred than dub - First few eps may be boring, especially until ep 20 or so, but after that it becomes one hell of a rollercoaster. - As a personal challenge, try not to fall in love with Luffy, kinda impossible xD - The pacing is indeed slow, I give you that, but its all worth it at the end.

"Bruh One Piece is the best you can binge it and the main reason I really like One piece is because of its story I feel like many anime could have so much more while one piece since it has so many episodes you could fill in so much even with all those episodes there aren't many fillers and even if they are fillers they are somewhat entertaining. It focus on many other character and each ark has a purpose it shows the character growth of many different characters some arks maybe focus on one character more though I like this makes it so some characters stand out in that ark and what they have to do with it some of the sad stories of the characters backgrounds are sad and entertaining the concept of 3 different types of devil fruits and sub categories within them is a good source of a fighting mechanic things such as the 3 different types of haki and how they can be used also contributes to that. Oda does a really good job of showing the characters personality, strength, and how they stand out because every character is unique and uses there power differently such as how sabo got inspired from ace though he adds his own techniques such as his dragon claw",10,Recommended,"Sep 25, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_027e3b04c6,23

"As everyone says, this is indeed one of the best anime. It has a nice story, amazing characters and all. But, I do have some major complaints about this anime. First, as everyone says, it's a bit slow-paced & people almost never die which shouldn't be the case considering the plot. Apart from these, this anime shows sexuality too much, and at places and points that it just looks stupid. People call it fanservice but I don't think the majority of fans like that. Eg. the most obscenity is done with NAMI showing up to the point that, She doesn't even mind being nude in front of people and all. According to this Anime, there r bathhouses in which men and women bath together naked. Like WTF!. But, don't be mistaken this anime isn't romantic at all, which I don't really mind as most main characters consider their dream most important.

The pacing can be slow at times but at end of the end,you can be assured that it will be worth watching.Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other.

"I have watched over 1000 episodes of one piece(not including filler) Disclaimer: I am specifically talking about the anime and not the manga or any of the movies. Just the tv show. I started watching one piece back in 2020. About a week after Netflix added the couple of arcs of the show. I was hesitant to watch it because I knew how long the show was and still running. But I decided why not. If I dont like it then Ill just drop it. Some people would say one piece starts off slow and boring and others would say they enjoyed it from the very first episode. I was one of the ones who thought it started off kinda slow. I heard one piece is like a one of a kind show but when I started my one piece journey I couldn’t see that. And I dont blame anyone that also feels that way. I dont even think the start of the show is bad just not all that intriguing to me. I actually didn’t like the main character Luffy at first. I thought he was childish(which he is) and also annoying. It seemed like every opportunity he had he will announce that he is a rubber man trying to become king of the pirates. And I got annoyed of that very quickly. But I did see why people would say it is enjoyable to watch. Slowly learning more and more of the big one piece world and meeting new characters while learning there backstories and seeing why they act the way they act is supercool to watch. As you get more into the story you start to realize how big and deep the one piece world really is. Getting introduced to more characters with their own goals and learning more about the world of one piece. As you keep watching you realize how deep the world of one piece really is, which adds more depth into each protagonist and antagonist of the story. Now to talk about some negatives. One piece is not a perfect show.Obviously the 1000 plus episodes is intimidating for people thinking about watching the show. My advice for those people is that you dont have to rush to watch all those episodes. Take your time with it. Take breaks of you need to. If you are really interested you will catch up before you know it. Also at times this show does use things like creating unnecessary shock moments just to add drama to the story. The reason why this show is so damn long is simply because of the awful pacing. Its hard to deal with it especially how faster pace new anime shows are becoming now like JJK, Black Clover, MHA and more. And yeah the pacing sucks. Its either something your just gonna have to look past or make it be a reason why not to watch it. There was an arc in the show, Skypiea, that pacing was so bad I was really considering dropping the show. And Skypiea isnt even a bad arc its just the pacing that makes it so hard to watch. But I kept going on my one piece journey. To conclude my review, I think one piece is an amazing show with amazing lessons behind it. The foreshadowing and world building in this show are truly something special. Yes its long and the pacing can be horrible at times, I truly believe it is worth the watch. A lot of people like to say or choose Naruto is better than one piece without giving it a chance(Used to be me) But I truly believe if you like naruto then you will like one piece.

"I started One Piece as just a little man, but came back to finish it off just a few months ago. Once a huge event happened at about 2/5 of the story, I found that the pacing from then on was cripplingly slow. Only due to the studios wanting the show to run all year with no breaks, has the pacing in this anime been brought down from a smooth sail in the calm belt into a small raft in a thunderstorm and anyone who's seen this show knows that the calm belt is far more exciting. For an example, there is one panel in the manga that seriously takes up 2 whole minutes of an episode. 1/120 of a manga chapter is apparently 1/10 of an episode in this show these days (of course not counting the lengthy intro and recaps). Despite the problems on the anime side of things, anything directly adapted from the manga (characters, plot, locations) is nearly flawless and the world-building is exceptional. You cannot find many plot holes in this series as there are explanations for so many things. I can't give examples because of spoilers but the world-building is done magnificently. The power systems in this series, being Haki and Devil Fruits are used very creatively. Turns out a guy made from rubber can be more than just flop his arms about... waaaay more. The Haki, being a power system separate from Devil Fruits, helps in stopping every new character using a Fruit, bringing more variety in the battles. Alas, I can only recommend you watch until episode 405. After that, the quality and quantity of this show drops significantly. After I dropped it I went and read the manga instead, now I read more manga than I watch anime. So at least I can thank the awful pacing of this show for introducing me to that.",7,Recommended,"Mar 16, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2da747922f,23
"One Piece is by far one of the 3 shounen anime i like the most, aside from naruto or my hero academy. But one piece deffinetly gives you the whole experiencia it just literally makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you twitch with excitement like an 5 year old kid. One would describe it as an “Anime/Manga about pirates” , but its simply much more than that. It never fails to entertain you but at the same time deals with a lot of grown-up themes like freedom and racism. The anime has been running since 1997 and the manga a bit longer than that. That’s almost 19 years. But it never feels old. Mostly because its a really huge world filled with lots of interesting characters each with their very unique and endearing personalities. Its hard not to get attached to these guys, because they have very human qualities that make them relatable and likable. It has a very well laid out story that makes you look forward to what happens next. Its no surprise that this is one of the big three anime alonngside naruto and bleach, but even though the story never gets boring, at least for me, really think you guys should give this anime a chance, the first 30 episodes of the anime are a little slow and hard to watch but after the loguetown part it just keeps getting better and better, definetly a 10/10 anime that everybody should give it a chance. If you’re an anime fan, chances are you’ve heard of one piece and have probably seen or read it. Even you’re not into anime or manga, you should give this a try.

"At first, I hated One Piece for it's style of forcing ugly designs on characters, making me swear I'd never see it. Oh boy, here we are. One Piece has a very complex, amazing world full of interesting islands and cool characters that you love to see. If you like seeing anime without having to worry too much about ""drama"" or all that, One Piece is an amazing watch. One Piece has it's ""ooho teary eyes"" moments, which are either done sadly, or in a very badass way that you love to see as a viewer. One Piece's first half (episodes 1-500) delivers amazing story arc's, letting the viewer see exactly what they want during it's perfect moments. One Piece's strong points are it's world and storytelling, which is done in an amazing way, introducing many amazing character's while the story progresses into a bigger sea. The more the characters get stronger, the stronger the enemies become. I could compliment the FIRST HALF of One Piece to be a whole 8/10 in terms of overall enjoyment, but the animation studio gave up after episode 517, it's timeskip. After One Piece's timeskip, the story gets progressively more boring with it's animation and blatantly trashed recycled animation, delivering mostly moving stills for it's episodes. One Piece loves to deliver a good story with amazing characters and the studio behind it loved to give it justice by gifting us with an amazing soundtrack and good animation. Until it didn't. With One Piece's length, I honestly recognize why they gave up after 517 episodes. The anime is worth watching, trust me. I would HIGHLY recommend watching One Piece until to the timeskip, then switching to the manga. I dropped One Piece after it's Dressrosa arc, which got too much for me to handle after it's constant moving still's. Sorry One Piece, you've gone on for too long for me to watch you. Still love it as a series. Watch it!",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 16, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_04673ea97f,23
"Piece is the best anime I've ever seen, with over 1000 episodes and over 20 years in the making, not only has it not lost it's charm, it just got better with Ark Vanos animation. Mr. Oda, who is a legend in manga, has worked so hard in characterizing the manga of this work that in no other work can you see all kinds of characters with their own story lines like the world of One Piece. Mr. Oda designed the world of One Piece based on our own world, where no land is even similar to another that is not seen in other anime. Of course, the anime had problems that need to be solved, one is the long fights and the dragging of the story that sometimes makes you nervous, the second is bringing back the failed and disappeared people to the story to make the story. more attractive. Thirdly, the animation problems are best compensated by episode 500 onwards, this work has given the best work in the comedy, adventure genre, which is rarely found in other works. Check out the movie's soundtrack, which I think is good, although it doesn't stir our emotions as much as Naruto's soundtrack. It should be noted that this work is a model of Dragon Ball, which is much more mature than this work. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this if you're new to anime, but if you've been watching anime for a long time, you'll be very happy.",10,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c1c0503b8d,23
"Review 29: One Piece (Yay Gum Gum fruit)!!!! A Worldwide favourite, but i only have one question, is there actually an anime out there that can take this one off of the shelves in over 1000 different countries?? I think not. Meet the clinicaly insane straw hatted pirates, that always seem to get their own way..... One Piece is a world wide famous anime and manga series to little five year olds, too 60 year olds who still remember the series from a while back. The series is packed with food, fighting, rather confusing moments and really (and i emphasis really) weird looking pirate maniacs that will do anything to get the one piece and the devil (gum gum) fruit. The main story in the series... well when i say main story i mean the overall series.... is supposed to about a young high pitched, squeaky voiced boy named Monket D.Luffy finding the one Piece to eventually become the King of Pirates like in ancient myths and legands. One problem though, he doesn't even have a ship, never mind a crew. And due to his young age no other pirates take him seriously even though he's trying to do them all a favour by helping them get to the One Piece and becoming the new King of the Pirates with them in his crew. The only time people or pirates usually take him serious, this keeps up through out the whole series of One Piece, is when he shows his what he calls his ""Gum, Gum Abbilities""... So to us this will be the devil fruit powers. When a devil fruit is consumed and depending on which type you have consumed then special un'realistic powers are released that you may or may not be able to control depending on how mature and smart you are.In this case Luffy has consumed a rare Devil Fruit that gives the consumer to extend parts of his of hers bodies to unbelievable lengths, and when punched the punches fly right off of his body or when shot at the rubber sends them flying back at the opponent. So basically we have a weird boy with an even weirder rubber body..... The series is based in another and slightly older fashioned world where pirates, thieves, bounty hunters and other strange peope all exisist mainly to defeat pirates but also to keep order in the world, stop wars between other countries and are also mainly here to stop pirates from over taking other towns and cities like they have done in the past and when we watch the series we get to see the over taking of many cities and towns happening right before our straw hatted and clinically insane pirates. The main character (as we have already established) is Luffy, his main goal in life is to be like Gol D. Roger. He was in fact the previous Pirate king and created the One PIece, a treasure that most normal people think is fake and is a disgrace to their world. Others like Luffy (and some others) Who have realised that if they obtain the One Piece they will be the next Pirate King, and as soon as news about a new pirate king starts to spread many more people will believe in the legand, which then means more fights and violence for Luffy and his soon to be crew. Everyone in the crew is human, well to an extent anyways.......... Monkey D. Luffy; Our main and insane character for the One Piece series. he's the leader of the straw hat pirates and has an extremely strange fighting style that stands out to the younger generation of anime watchers and lovers. His fighting style is unique but funny, this adds to the genre of the show which is of course a comedy. As his body strecthes to these unbelievable lengths and his body can also deflect damage from opponents it adds humour to any fight that he's in which means that if your reading the manga the reader can relax as they know that he'll never be in any real danger, when watching the anime we can sense some danger in a few situations but nothing to serious to make the watcher hang on to the edge of their seat as they are worried for him. He's a fun loving boy who doesn't really see the seriousness of fighting or being a pirate until other members start joining the crew. He doesn't really care what other people think of him or what other pirates think of him and his crew, the only time he will care is when a pirate or human hurts on of his crew members or damages his ship. He isn't the type of person to start a fight for no particular reason and usually thinks things through when it comes to fighting, when it comes to his friends and every day life he turns a little bit stupid, the stereo typical type of person for an anime like this and as he is in fact the lead character it means all other characters are also laid back, relaxed and at times can be as stupid as him. The crew eventually becomes huge, one of the first members to be the fearfull Roronoa Zoro..... A three bladed samurai, he was born to kill and to assinate anyone who gets in his way. Luffy managed to get him to join as Zoro had already been captured by the authorities and was tidied up to a pole, he hadn't eaten in a while so Luffy had amanged to taunt him with food and bribe him by setting him free on one condition....... He joined Luffy's crew, even though at this point he didn't even have a ship. The recruitment for the other members also covers the same sort of method, Luffy makes a deal with them as long as they join his crew. As i said eventually there are quite a few members that join the crew, some hate Luffy as he's way too hyper and some admire his dreams and goals in life to become the next king of the Pirates. we see new and old characters that Luffy has encountered through the series joining the Crew once they get to know him a bit better, like Nami we see her in the firs episode of One Piece and the audience expects her to join the crew straight away but it takes a while as she follows them around and then decides to join, and there are others who we only encounter a bit further on in the series like Brook, Sanji, Usopp, Nico Robin, Franky..... And if you haven't even watched the series even once then you still might of heard of little Tony Tony Chopper!! All in all the series is amazing, i've only seen parts of the series and little snipits but it's still an amazing series! Only theres one little problem, the begininning of the series graphics seem out of date, and when we see the latest episodes the beginning ones don't quite fit in. But apart from this the series is amazing and is a must watch, it's famous world wide and has captured the hearts and minds of millions of anime and manga lovers!!

"One Piece is a different sort of beast than other shows. I'd undeniably recommend anyone to watch it, but the issue lies in that in order to really get a feel for how good the series can be. In my opinion the series isn't very good until the Baratie arc that starts at episode 19, and only really begins to show how good it can be at the Arlong arc at episode 31. That isn't to say the early episodes are god awful or anything. But if I was only rating the series based on the earliest episode I'd probably saddle it with a 6.5 (fine, but not good). So the thing about One Piece is that it does require investment. But after those 19 or 30 episodes, the payoff is enormous. There is nearly 700 more episodes of a great anime with limited filler. One Piece just really checks all the boxes for me: it can be funny, can bring you to tears, and can be undeniably badass. As I have been reviewing shows more and more, I've noticed that one of the aspects that leads to me to rate shows more highly is the world they take plae in. In plenty of great shows, you have a set world and you are exploring the characters story within that world, but One Piece leaves you exploring the world along with Luffy, as his story progresses. There is so many mysteries yet to be solved in One Piece, and discovering more and more about it is part of what makes One Piece so grand. The characters are also done pretty well. The dynamic of the crew really represents an all for one, one for all type mentality. A lot of dramatic events happen throughout the show, and watching people come together through those hardships is endearing. Really the only reason that this is not a 10 for me is that I reserve my 10's for shows I consider true masterpieces, that can't be improved (I only have two 10's). And for as great as OP is, it does have it's issues. It starts pretty slow and it's pacing could be better (if you are watching week to week, this gets pretty frustrating. As a binge it isn't as big of a deal though). Also, the art is meh. I do kind of like how unique it is and it does get better as the show progresses, but this can't really touch some other great shows when it comes to the art. Although it is done much better than other shonens and not as prevalent, there is some filler. Even though the filler arcs aren't bad the core series is definitely much better. So, quick summary. Slow starter (give it at least 20 episodes), but fantastic plot and interesting world to explore and learn more about as you are watching the series. Humor is Good. Drama and the feels can be spectacular in big moments. The action and fight scenes are good. Watch One Piece!",9,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a686306193,23
"Story : 10 Art: 5 Sound : 8 Character : 8 Enjoyment : 6 Overall : 7 One Piece is one of the biggest anime and manga out there, not just in length, but also in popularity, now popularity is not a good way to proof quality, but when the source manga is not only THE most sold manga in the world with over 100mil more sales than the number 2 most sold manga but its also THE most sold COMIC in the world by a single author and it got a record in the Guinness book, beside manga sales its also one of the most popular anime even here on mal at number 32 and 4 in most favourites, its also one of the most talked about show in youtube, with many big anime youtubers being fans of it, like Gigguk, chibi and even someone who is more critical like thatanimesnob said it was actually pretty good at some point, and again I know that popularity doesn't equal quality, but when a show is THIS popular, you can at least fairly say its does somethings good. over the years the show's quality has changed a lot, and not in a linear fashion where it kept getting better or kept getting worse, it just went up and down in quality a lot, to the point that if I had to rate each arc differently some would get as high as a 10 and some would get as low as a 5. The Good : 1- If you look at the genres for One Piece in MAL you'll see : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Shounen, Super Power and I have to say one piece does all of these genres very very well. Action : the fights in one piece aren't that frequent with the story more focused around other things, but when they do happen they are very well done and there many different types of fights, you have some fights that are centred around raw power or some that use tactics and brains, and every fight has a lot of meaning behind it, in a sense that the stakes are high and what the characters had to do to reach that fight was a lot, basically the author really knows how to hype up fights before they happen. Adventure/Fantasy : the is probably one of the best thing about one piece, I've met many different kinds of people who've watched the show and one thing they always praise -even if they hated most other things- is the world building and the adventure in it, the world in one piece is HUGE with many island that each have their own kind of twist, a lot of different factions from pirates to world government to underworld workers to kings and leaders of the islands, almost every type of mythical creature there is, from mermaids, fishmen and dwarfs to giants, dragons, undead and talking animal people ( and much more ), and experiencing all of these islands gives a really nice sense of adventure, and the world is also very well connected, for example one character from the early episodes ends up being in an important character in an arc 500 episodes later. Comedy : this one is different to each person but I found the comedy in one piece hilarious and has really good delivery and timing, I'd link you some funny moments but its hard to understand it in its own without having an idea about the characters. Drama : its hard to go into this one without too much spoilers but I can say that one piece has affected me emotionally with its many tearjerking moments, even ones that you'd never expect. Superpowers : Superpowers in one piece can be very simple or very creative and interesting, but even the simple ones can be made creative with how the characters use them. Now MAL doesn't say One Piece has Mystery, but I'd say it does, Oda (the aurhtor) also leaves a lot of hints and forshadowing in many parts of the story and its why there are a bunch of one piece theories out there, I mean just search "" one piece theory"" on youtube and see how many results you get. and the ways these mysteries are revealed are also pretty good, not in an asspull kind of way but in way that will make you go "" whhaaat! so thats what happened!"" 2- One Piece has some of my favourites Soundtracks that are really effective in doing what they are trying to do, whether its for building hype or making the viewer emotional. 3- The characters are also a great part of one piece, with many of them having really awesome designs, interesting/emotional backstory, and each have their own goals and ideologies. Our main crew in particular is really great, seeing their interactions with each other is surprisingly one of my favourite things about the show, they are all interesting in their own ways. The Bad : Just like my ratings indicates, One Piece has a lot of problems and even someone who loves one piece like me can see them. 1- For starters the animation is pretty bad overall, it changes over the course of the show, some parts its Sakuga level but most of the time its pretty bad, especially compared to today's standards. 2- while I did say the soundtracks are usually great, the recent episodes haven't really been using great soundtracks, sometimes the SFXs are all over the place, The voice acting for the most part is pretty good and I have no problem with it, but its nothing mindblowing. 3- the pacing of the anime is very very slow, the manga has 870 chapters ( as of right now ) and the anime has 798 episodes, just by looking at those numbers alone you can tell just how slow it is, with the recent 200 something episodes only adapting one chapter OR LESS per episode which is just crazy slow, one piece the manga is already slow enough at some parts but the anime just made it really terrible, there are also always about 5 minutes spent on recaps+opening. however that is not always the case, while the early episodes also had slow pace, its wasn't nearly as bad as now, and it was a very minor problem, which is why I kept watching the show and didnt drop it. 4- Being repetitive is another one of One Piece's problems, however this one is minor, because while every arc has core elements that happen in ever other arc, for the most part its still a fresh new arc and these core elements are done in a slightly different way. 5- Asspulls, One Piece doesn't have many of those but it still does have them and its a problem, fortunately though, when it does happen its in the arcs that are considered one of the better arcs ( because of other things of course ) and so this problem is overshadowed. 6- some parts are pretty much useless and the show would be a lot better without them. Overall I'd say for sure give One Piece a chance, and keep going until you just cant watch it anymore, if you reach that point before episode 500 then well I guess its not for you, if you reach it after, then I'd say move over to the manga and give it a try, its worth it. And thats about it, I hope you found my review helpful, I apologise for any English mistakes I had (English is not my first language) I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed the reviews for one piece are either all 10s or all 5 or below, and I found both to be ridiculous, so I decided to write my own review.",7,Recommended,"Jul 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4107110a9e,23
"One piece! Seriously a great story! I liked the plot a lot and the character Luffy is just amazing. He gives a very positive impression about how people should live their life - simple, without worries, taking challenges and working hard to achieve the goal. All the characters' behavior is appropriate and suits to them. All songs especially the opening ones are so good. I actually downloaded them and I listen to them frequently. And the whole anime is so well made. Each scenery, each island and the sea looks so unique and beautiful. The action is so exciting and the suspense is just thrilling. What will happen next? Who will do what? That's the question I have every time I watch an episode. And I really enjoyed watching it. Some drawbacks are the extended fights that just go on for episodes and one gets bored to wait for the fight to finish. There are some fillers which are out of story line and aren't much interesting. One piece is going a bit slow, which I hate the most. But, the overall story is great, characters are great and its fun watching it.",9,Recommended,"May 9, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d238c53569,23
"One Piece is excellent in every single way. The characters are deep and interesting, the world feels really alive and fleshed out, and Oda really knows how to pace arcs correctly. Sadly, the anime adaptations goes from good to great to amazing to ok to absolute clusterfuck. It's a really depressing case of unending anime series syndrome. I remember watching this about 7 years ago when there were about 400 epipsodes, and you could mostly skip all the filler arcs and end up with a kind of sluggish but overall enjoyable series, but later arcs, I believe starting at about episode 430-ish, have a lot more filler INSIDE the actual adaptation arcs, which makes it that much more difficult to get around. I've also seen some of the newer fights, and they were really disappointing. The animation was really bad compared to the better arcs (Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark and Shabaody Archipielago). My recommendation for watching One Piece is: look for a guide that says which episodes are filler, and try to skip as much of it as possible. If it ever becomes unbearable, switch to the manga. Personally, as soon as I caught up with the anime, I started reading the manga. I still read it to this day and it's on my top 3 manga list, alongside FMA and Magi.",7,Recommended,"Nov 27, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6d97c79f56,23

After you have finished the Skypea arc, trust me, the real story will begin. It will lead them to a new threat, THE WORLD! It will have our heroes a hard time in overcoming this threat until today.

One Piece is distinct in its ability to stick with you like nothing else. The style, the music, the story, everything is so memorable and special. Gotta love One Piece.

"This is probably one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen. But, this is not a show that you should be considering to watch as one of your first ten anime series. This show should be something that you are wanting to watch because everyone says it's good and you have probably already been watching anime for about a year. I will mention this again ""This is a great show"" but it deserves a huge amount of commitment and your attention. With its current 832 episode marker, you should not treat this as a walk in the park. I was able to start and catch up in about 6 months but, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Take your time. If something catches your eye you can keep watching but it isn't something that I would recommend just to get your episode count up. Again, ""This is a great show"" and if you are just watching it because you have nothing else to watch and you aren't giving you're utmost attention to the show then forget it, it isn't worth your time. That said I would recommend this show to anyone that likes adventure shows and things like Dragon Ball and Fairy Tail. Also, THIS IS A BIG TIP. If you have stopped watching One Piece because you don't like the art style, you don't find it interesting, and you are only about 60 episodes in. I can't stress this enough KEEP WATCHING. That is when the show gets good and if you are stopping there then you are missing all of the good parts of the series that come later. There is also something else that I totally recommend doing. Skip from episodes 152-196. This is probably the most boring arc of a series that I have ever watched. It is on par with the Key of the Starry Sky arc from Fairy Tail. If you watch this One Piece arc you are sure to stop the show. It is a guarantee. It is that bad. However, if you are that person who wants to see all of a show because they want to talk to their friends about the series that they have seen all of. I promise you it isn't worth it. Of the 6 months that I mentioned earlier that it took me to catch up one and a half of them were me just watching other things because I was stuck at that arc and I wasn't advancing. I am not saying don't watch it I am just stating that it might be something that you don't necessarily want to watch. The third and final thing that I am going to mention about One Piece is the opening songs. These opening songs are probably some of the best that there are in shows. All though very rarely do they relate to the plot in the actual visuals, the songs are on point. I have most of them downloaded on Spotify and I can't even tell you how many times I have listened to these songs. They are amazingly good. But I have to warn you. Around the 400 episodes, they have the Toei Animation opening sequence. You might get into a habit of just skipping the whole opening and the recap which is fine but watch out for one thing. While I was watching I got into the habit of skipping the song but I never checked the songs that I was skipping so it turned out that I had skipped two of the openings that I didn't know about. So my advice to you is that you should at least check what you are skipping at least once every 20 episodes. That is really helpful and makes sure that you know about all the openings that are coming up, and you never know you might actually enjoy some of them. So, in conclusion, you should really consider watching this show and if you don't like it, No big deal but just letting you know there are no other shows like this out there.",10,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1143675d5b,24
"SPOILER FREE REVIEW One Piece is, in a word, perfect. Just perfect. Honestly, I was a bit reluctant to watch it at first because, to me, a story about a boy wanting to become ""Pirate King"" sounded so bland, cliche and overall boring, and the art style was a bit too old-school for my liking, but I was dead wrong! There is nothing boring about it. I find that a lot of people complain about the length, or the art, or whatever, but the thing is, once I really got into One Piece, I just completely forgot about the art style and the length and focused on the anime itself. By the way, the animation EVENTUALLY improves... eventually. I'd also like to discuss Luffy, the main character. I love how the stereotypical “protagonist” is just thrown out the window when it comes to Luffy. What you need to know about Luffy is that no, he is not a hero. Yes, he admits that he admires heroes, but he certainly doesn't wanna be one. Simply put, he’s a pirate. He seeks freedom and doesn’t give a damn about Justice. I guess that's one of the things I found most enjoyable; you can just get submerged in the Straw Hat’s adventure’s as if you yourself are also there laughing, having fun, or even crying with them. I just love the interactions between the crew members, (especially Sanji and Zoro) as well as just the characters themselves. Everyone in the anime is unique and have there own little quirks to them, and, seeing how absolutely massive the world of One Piece is, Eiichiro Oda certainly did a fantastic job. Also, the balance between action and humour is definitely worth mentioning. I could go on and on about how great this is, for like forever, but I don't think you wanna read that. Anyways, if you haven't watched One Piece, you really are missing out because I can say honestly and without any hesitation whatsoever that One Piece is one of those few anime which can truly be considered as a ""Master Piece"".",10,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdaa01fab0,24
"One Piece .... My favorite Anime of all time. Here in this review let me tell you why. Firstly One Piece might look like your typical kind of Shonen but no! One Piece is very unique in many ways like a character's laughter, different kind of race/type of people in the OP Universe, how characters from an episode are link to future episodes or having a background which connects to the past. Oda-sensei(The Mangaka) doesn't ""throw away"" characters he made even though its a minor role. These minor role characters will be appearing or being thought of again in the series. Oda-sensei is just that good in character development! Almost every episode of One Piece is important and if you miss 1 or 2 episodes, you are actually missing quite a lot. One Piece is an Anime which you must never underestimate it because if you were to sit down and really think about it, One Piece is actually a very very deep series. Story Rating: 9/10 Character's art and animation ... Well, the earlier episodes of One Piece definitely looks old and of course not HD(But I think there's a remake of the earlier episodes? Which was made in HD). But that doesn't matter. As you watch on, the art gets better and better. Not really something to be bothered with. As for the animation, sometimes it is quite bad but usually happens in those unimportant scenes. Art/Animation Rating: 8/10 For the Sound, its good which I'll rate it 9/10. So in overall, such a long Anime definitely might get boring at certain parts due to history talking or draggy scenes but fret not, those are still important because almost everything in One Piece are linked.

"One Piece started airing in 1999 and has been airing non-stop ever since then. It has reached over 700 episodes, and the animation hasn't been top-notch ever since around the time-skip. But, there are better things about One Piece that aren't about the animation and... well, the length of One Piece is the least thing I worry about. If you really like the show, and enjoyed it, like I did, I finished it in around 2 months, and am now bored and don't know what to watch. It's not that I don't know what to, I'm not really motivated to watch anything right now. Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King who was the strongest pirate who ruled the seas. Well, I don't have to explain this, because the page of MAL says it, so explaining it is kind of useless. Although this is the main story, it branches off into several characters stories, who have their own kind of backstory. Luffy's is shown in the first couple of episodes, and re-shown after the Marineford arc, what really happened. Zoro is also shown within the first 20 episodes... well, I ain't sitting here explaining which backstories were shown in which episodes. But, the story keeps on going and going which is my favourite part about One Piece. The animation and art-style... It ain't the greatest thing in existence. But, unlike other people, I frankly don't give a shit. I franky don't give a shit. Ha! Nah, sorry, I'll kill myself right now. Anyway, I don't care for the animation and art-style as long as the content is still good. I can watch things with not-so-good animation and art-style as long as the story and content of it is good. The soundtrack is my second favourite thing about One Piece. I think it's second. Well, anyway, I like how a scene you try not to bawl your eyes out in, and you're succeeding... until.... SAD MUSIC SLASH! Yeah, this is basically what happens. And then they kill you. The characters, third favourite. I have a lot of favourite things about this anime. I like sometimes how they re-use voice actors for different characters in the series. It's easier than finding new people, so I kind of see why they do this. The character development though, is so good. It makes Boku no- Not the best example, so I won't say anything. I enjoyed this anime a lot. I didn't start watching it a lot until the Enies Lobby arc (late 200s and early 300s) and it wasn't the greatest series before then. But, after that moment, I started watching the anime a lot, every day even. I ain't a serious anime watcher or reviewer, so I can't judge an anime better than someone that actually lives off of this. But one thing I can say is, this anime is great. If you're planning to watch it, don't stop before at least Arlong Park. If you still don't like it at Arlong Park... well... try to get to Alabasta at least. It's one of the first big arcs, and Alabasta features one of the first main villains to ever appear. So, don't back down from the first couple of episodes. Continue. Continue. Watch it all... ...or just read the manga.",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2d3bbf0a3a,24
"One piece is one of the best anime I have seen. First of all its plot is huge and outstanding. Oda-san has created a whole world for this anime. In addition one piece's soundtracks are epic. Moreover the characters are well-designed. Besides this the voice actors are well-picked and they're doing a great job. Lastly the main reason I rate one piece as one of the best anime is that it includes many funny moments but it also contains epic fighting scenes, too.",10,Recommended,"Jul 24, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ba65f6e9a8,24
"I really took me a while to start watching One Piece, I was too lazy for is a very long anime !! But something inside me stirred up the desire to sail the seas of One Piece. If you are thinking how I was, take a chance to One Piece, I believe you will certainly want to embark with Monkey D. Luffy in the most incredible adventures the Grand Line to search for the legendary treasure One Piece. But first, Luffy looking for a crew, and you will be enchanted with each new member. From beginning we are introduced to each of them, their life stories and especially their dreams. It is interesting how the dreams of each connect in a peculiar way to Luffy, causing them to unite on an incredible journey. Gradually the gang is being formed and coming together like a puzzle. And speaking in the troop, I admire the way in One Peice explore friendship and companionship. More than how members of a family, each fighting the other, they take their pain, give the blood to protect his companion as hard as it may seem the battle. As captain, Luffy is what more worries about your nakamas! The straw hat gang face harsh battles along the journey. Many ruthless enemies crossing your way some of them stand out for me as Arlong, Crocodile, Enel and of course the World Government are the most terrible so far. Of course, not everything is made of hard battles! One Piece always finds a way to start a good laugh, often starring Luffy, Usopp and Chopper, who do mischief on the ship during the trips. While all is quiet and its nakamas are fine, Luffy not worry about anything except food! What many times does look like he is not captain. One Piece also take many tears of our hearts! Some of our gang have stories really suffered as Nami and Robin. But as I said Luffy always take the pain of your friends and fight for them to the end. One Piece has a wonderful soundtrack, to remember the older animes. Art can seem strange at first, but you get used quickly. However, if you like adventure, laughter, emotions and the power of friendship I'm sure you will love One Piece!",10,Recommended,"Jul 24, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e1ea6ee4ad,24
"Pre timeskip (1-516) is good, especially the last half of it is outstanding and definitely the reason you should try watching this show. One Piece has incredible worldbuilding and great stories to tell, but fights may not come as often as some would like and early on may feel childish to turn newcomers off. Even some of the fights in this show may fall short. Regardless I can promise that this show has some unforgettable moments and characters. Post timeskip (517-?) however is something that I don't consider worth getting into unless you are interested in following the story to the end. Yes, the show will still have great stories, moments, and characters to introduce, as well as more lore, but it has multiple flaws: 1. The arcs are bigger than before, this also means that the Strawhat Crew which I personally grew to love gets less spotlight while dozens of side characters get time to shine. Some strawhats especially start to feel useless, and their growth as characters definitely dulls down. 2. Overall pacing and animation quality seems to struggle. The episodes feel more stretched out than before and can be quite the struggle to go through. 3. The show starts to be somewhat repetitive with it's narrative. - Regardless, if you enjoy the show it's most likely worth going through.",7,Recommended,"Jun 19, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1e9b231c0c,24
"This review can contain spolliers(I'll try my best to not to give any) and spelling mistakes(My native language isn't english). I've dropped this anime 3 times in its beginning, and today it's one of my favorites, so I decided to do this review so people can have patience and take advantage of this great work. Let's started with the story (10/10) - The story it's simple by the began, but having the novelty of the main character isn't but the traditional hero always, telling the story of an outlaw pirate(Luffy) and the pursuit of his dream of becoming the king of pirates. In this anime Luffy has a goal, different from many other anime, several times you will hear the main character scream '' I'm gonna become King Of the Pirates'' like Naruto scream ''I will become Hokage''. This is not something negative since with a goal already in mind the anime doesn't create much content that hasn't connection with the main objective, this making the anime more ''fast'', I just remember of 4 episodes fillers in +700. But of course nothing is perfect and certain episodes try to delay the story a lot, especially in the saga Dressrosa, in which there are many repeated scenes, such as scenes where people show often running in the same episode. This anime takes a while to get interesting, to get an idea I dropped it about 3 times at its beginning, where the fights can't get my attention and I was surprising very the different traits, mainly in the eyes of the characters. It took me until episode 70 to start really taking advantage of. But after that Eiichiro Oda manages to create a whole new world(literally, lol), with a very well made plot and organizations that have their secrets or their particular goals and all this can have connection with the main characters, becoming more and more an unforeseeable anime. Art (9/10) - As I had said, the art and ''lines, dashes'' of the characters is very different from ordinary. At first I thought it was horrible, but I easily got used to it and many of the characters I consider to be one of the most creative and beautiful to see. But it really took me a while to get used to Usopp, being one of the most different characters in appearance. And to think that today he is considered ''God Usoop''... (not spolier, I swear). It is also good to say that throughout the anime the art improves a lot in all aspects, only I not liking the change in Robin. Sound (10/10) - Great music, especially in action scenes. My favorite is ''The very, very, very strongest''. I don't know much what to comment more here, so let's go to the next one. Character (10/10) - All characters are unique, both in design and in personality. Luffy looks a bit ''baka'' too much, but that makes it all very funny, and when he gets angry the only thing you think is: ''woohaaa Luffy will get him''. My favorite one is Zoro, he's the best... He's like Vegeta but even better... lol, but it's truth. This anime hasn't only 1 main, throughout the story more and more characters are highlighting and catching our attention, but of course that focuses more on Luffy... Also has a great prominence for main characters, several times you will get totally annoyed with them. Even villains who don't possess grandiose powers are able to make us angry with their very exentric personalities. There are so many great characters in this anime that if I were to quote everyone I would write for 3 days and I could tell spoliers unintentionally , so I'll just say that and go to the next one. Enjoyment (10/10) - You will enjoy every moment watching this anime, but it's important to have patience especially at the beginning of it, but it will be worth every second that you spend watching. Honestly I delayed to start this anime because of the large number of episodes that it has, but before long I watched so many episodes that I easily reached the current episodes and still hoping that this incredible anime takes a long time to finish. Overall (10/10) - This anime is incredible, is it Master Piece in all aspects, mainly in story... So the only thing I say to you that has read all this review is: please be patient with the beginning of the anime that in the end you will be inspired by this great work of Eiichiro Oda.",10,Recommended,"May 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8e03116d4e,24
"Awesome and long. Long enough to take up your whole summer if you start from the start but tasteful enough to make it worth it. If the sheer number of episodes scare you from starting to watch this anime then don't worry, if you skip the intro theme song and recap each episode can be done in 15-20 mins. this anime is all about a character named Luffy who starts of as a weak nobody gathering friends along the way who help him achieve his dream while trying to accomplish their personal goals. The character development for each and every character doesn't seem to stop which is awesome for such a long anime and even some of the enemies and acquaintances keep getting stronger (not spoiling much :P). The anime is expected to be roughly 1200 episodes long and Luffy has already gone through a lot up till now but surely the bigger and more badass stories are yet to come.",9,Recommended,"Jun 4, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6e8010709a,24
"""The beautiful depth of the story itself compensates for the drag of this anime..."" okay Im not going to write a review on every little aspect and detail. Rather I do want to highlight the negative side of this anime because there is only few that bugs me. If dealt with then I believe it could be the most amazing anime of all time. My biggest pet peeves with this anime are mainly two things. 1) the DRAG. Seriously the last anime that I thought was a drag was Dragonball Z. Seriously One Piece takes 1/4 of your entire episode on the starting theme song and the ""previously on One Piece"". THus I always fast forward to the 4-5mn mark to start watching. Also they spend another good 1/4 of the anime on slow walking characters, slow reactions, to slow opening doors, to replayed movements. Its hilariously dragged out. HOWEVER i get it! they are pumping out episodes non stop since 1999 on top of movie specials, and special eps. I get it, its probably how the people in the studio cope with it. But still, it drives me insane. THats why I always binge watch One Piece. Once a year during Christmas holidays I watch around 50 episodes. BUT F*CK ME! even with a year worth of episodes its only like 1 week into the actual story line. 2) Another pet peeve is the character of Luffy. YEs you heard me, the main character, the indestructible, loved by all, Monkey f*cking D Luffy. Dont get me wrong, do i like the character? absolutely. But he pisses me off because of his character and personality. YEs at first i enjoyed his irrational, free spirited, careless fearless personality, but that goes into some extent. With every crisis that arrises because of Luffys immaturity alot of ppl suffer. But ofcourse its an anime so it all works out in the end, so i dont mind it. However what I do mind is the fact that he just doesnt grow up nor learn from his mistakes. Hes the same luffy from ep 1. Sure he learnt new skills, and broaden his boundaries. But his major maturity level, of dealing with situation hasnt changed. If he knows his rash decisions or irrational behaviours have caused many people to stumble then like any other human being he should be able to learn from it. Thus I find him selfish in that sense. But the irony is he is portrayed as the most selfless character who is willing to die for his friends, which is the cause of his vast popularity. But my major argument is simply, hes selfish in the sense of not having the self control in his lack of maturity. like any other decent human they should be able to grow and mature. But I think he hasnt. But I understand without this side of him the anime wouldnt be as adventurist as it is, which we all known to love. Overall its still an amazing anime, but this is just my honest opinion.",8,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4105e03d24,24
"I am frustrated with how this anime is turning out. Up till the big mom arc the series was good. The dresroa arc is great, Big mom was fine but then came the long anticepated Wano. This is where this anime officialy crumbles in my eyes. From here on out every character turns into pure cringe. THe scipts of the characters is written like a 5 years old. Oda lost his writing skill and his ability to tell a story. Its sad but true. Watchign through Wano is just frustrating. Wano is pure and utter trash. The way characters are pictured even those do not hold up any longer. When Kin nemontells the story of Odin you see Luffy lash out and not stuffing his face. Up till now Luffy never cared about the background, he just wanted to help. The way he lashes out and Nami and the others react is just so cringe. The way they show it shows its just filler on the screen to strech out the episode. Oda no longer respects his readers and viewers. He hjas no respect his fans either. As soon as the arc startsyou get 2 episodes after that 2 filler episodes. Great start Oda how dare you do that. Then as it all progresses it just goes down hill. THe time traveling is crap. Don't touch something you can not do. Time travel is difficult to get right and Oda completely missed the mark. Momonoske is the most annoying character ever made. Its like Ussop 2.0 pure crap. Ussop is a waste of space aswell. He never learns and only a few times gets brave but is still the same character he was since the start. He never grew a pair. The intro song is nice its an improvement. The art is just the same as always. The story became a pile of smelling shit. The characters are bad. Monlogs are written by a 5 year old. Just lay down the pen or relearn yourself how to tell a story and how to create the characters. I had the aniem rated around an 8. Wano alone makes me drop this number to a 1. THat is how bad Wano is. The anime and the manga should have ended after the big mom arc i gues.",1,Not Recommended,"Feb 11, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_dd3feb5124,24
"This review will be undeniably biased! ""I believe that no matter how old we grow and mature we get, we will always have that child inside us"" and ONE PIECE is the that woke mine. Of course, just like other anime, this one is probably not for everyone as we have our own different taste of genre. This anime requires time and commitment to be able to understand the whole story. First with the brilliant Author, I myself is a huge fan of Fairy Tail (Mashima Hiro) and Naruto (Kishimoto Masashi) they are my top three! but I still believe that Eiichiro Oda is the best among all of them because until now I can't still figure out how he does such amazing plot twist throughout the story and the fact that the ENDING has already been laid out and so much has already happened yet the ending remains unchanging is just too brilliant. Second, Toei production! This anime has been following the manga and there has to be a gap between the latest chapter and episode. Therefore, the time comes when one anime has to make a filler but when one piece has to make one they are still able to connect it with the flow of the series and that's what makes them amazing. The first episode has an old animation since technology has not been developed at that time but now they create this amazing design and animation. Thrid, Characters 9 members! namely, LUFFY, ZORO, NAMI, USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER, ROBIN, FRANKY, and BROOK! these nine characters are the one that brings joy in the series the bond and loyalty of these people are truly remarkable. All of them have gone through painful childhood and LUFFY the captain of the crew has made a huge impact in their life and made them capable of changing to reach their individual dreams. Luffy's faith to the crew is one of the most amazing things for me, ""betrayal"" may come but he himself (instinct basically) knows that there is a reason why one member can act that way and of course he is right. Every saga introduced a new character and all of them comes with a sad story which touches the viewer's life and can truly bring you learnings! Fourth, STORY! as I said ODA truthfully is one brilliant mangaka/author. The whole series is full of plot twists and emotions. as I mentioned every saga and arc introduce a new character and all of them comes with a shocking plot twist. There will be times when something is mentioned in the beginning of the episode but we will only get the explanation in the middle of the story. OVERALL THERE'S SO MUCH PLOT TWISTS AND EXPLANATION ODA NEEDS TO LAY OUT TO HIS READERS! SO MUCH ENJOYMENT, EXCITEMENT, AND THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO! A NEVER BORING ANIME! This anime is a roller coaster and of course, this is beyond 10 for me in comes of ratings! I recommend this manga/anime to people who can truly commit and can give time since it has currently 867 chapters and 791 episodes (I am following both manga and anime)!",10,Recommended,"Jun 6, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9443a0d52a,24
"First thing I like about one piece is the world, never seen a world like that, and believe me i watched a lot of anime, the story just gets bigger every second, whenever you say it's close to the end, Oda just be like here more worlds here more islands here more genders here shichibukai ..etc, but all arcs are just too repetitive, you know what is going to happen whenever each arc stars. Luffy goes to this village or town or island, finds problems, sees either a small kid or a cute and beautiful female, she asks him for help while crying and luffy helps her and makes that area full of peace and stuff, and at the end he calls himself a fucking pirate, the fuck that ain't a pirate i'd call that a sailor or something, First time i see a pirate bringing peace and stuff, the marine are just chilling they have no job to do luffy will bring peace and do all the stuff, no and the problem is that after he does that they just make his bounty higher lel. talking about bounties, at the start of one piece it was something cool and it like had a good taste, with time going it just became something that shows how strong this character is, it became something like we need to rate the charatcters strength with his bounty, which i think is something stupid, dude teech's bounty was 0 at a time don't fuck with me, Yea teech. He is the real pirate, he is the one who will be the pirate king, if Oda really does it and makes Teech get the one piece then luffy fights him and takes it from him it's gonna be fire. Only scary thing is that if one piece turns out to be the power of friendship, i won't care cause i won't even watch it's ending but god damn i'll laugh so fucking loud at the fans. One piece art and character designs, I have a big problem with them I don't know why, Oda can draw some cool looking characters, Proof for that is luffy's crew, well that's if we exclude franky with his short ass pants, Usopp's long ass nose, also chopper, and sanji's eyebrow, and goddamn that whole crew looks like shit except for nami and robin. For real tho characters like Shanks and Mihok-, never mind Mihok's chit chats and his mustache are just irretating, You feel like he is telling you fill in the empty space. Characters like Marco, Kid, Law and others, well probably not much others. Then fucking Oda comes with his cringeness and draws some characters that make you want to puke 10 times without water breaks, like the 7th shichibukai and his mother that acts like shirohige's wife, characters like franky with his short ass pants that opens his stomach to drink coke and give him power, Raizo the Ninja, more like the dumb fuck, was something i wanted to see since hes talks were there a while before, now he looks like this bruh, how does that look like a fucking ninja, don't get me wrong It's not like I want him to draw beautiful and cute and kawaii characters and doki doki and shit, no no this is a pirate world, draw some characters like teech, shirohige except for his big mustache. Devil fruits in one piece, in one piece it's kind of different in the way of getting powers and stuff, let's say in other animes, characters can get stronger by shouting at the top of their lungs, others need to eat a piece of hair, others you just have to become bold to be strong, and don't make me talk about the anime that made the character become strong cuz he found a notebook, well in one piece, you just have to go to the vegetable market to be strong, ok well you eat that devil's fruit and you get a special power, three kinds of devil's fruits : paramecia and it is anything in life, can make you gomu gomu, can make bring you back to life, can turn you into a human if you are not one (looking at chopper) can turn you into a doctor, basically anything. Logia gives you nature elements, lava water ice fire shit stuff you know, then Oda once was drunk I guess and said katakori's is a Logia, then he got sober and changed it and said it's a special kind of paramecia (wow i can't believe i remember this much). Then there is zone, which basically turns you into an anime, I am tring to find a better way to say it but I can't find any, you can literally become a dog, or a dragon... OH RIGHT how did I almost forget, eating these fruits makes you unable to swim, so you become a pirate that can't swim, same thing as a butterfly without her wings, a car without tires, Anime time without cringe. Devil fruit were everything at the first of one piece, like it's the one with the strongest one is the strongest, but then with the haki getting introduced, I just learned to see them as a small power up and the haki is everything, hearing that the pirate king didn't have any fruit and just used haki is enough The main characters which are our crew that look kind of cursed, well a lot cursed which are Luffy the captain, zoro that needs a compass, Sanji the cook, Usopp the sniper, Nami the beautifu- navigator, Chopper the doctor, Short pants mf the carpenter or the blacksmith idk, Robin the... yeah I think a scientist and the singer brook my favorite in all the crew. over all that we have the real main character, best character without any doubt, the mother of dragons, the best doctor, the next hokage in the magic kingdom in the clover kingdom, who else other than Trafalgar D.Water Law, best character in one piece. talking about the best we can't forget the celestial dragons, they are just too nice and good, they choose others before themself, soo keen and lovely and suitable to rule the world. also the fuck is a talking ship? the crew crying when they are burning it and the ship talking saying "" don't cry guys don't worry"" ???? bitch you should be saying ouch it's hot The marine's soldiers are just for numbers and no one can disagree, just sheep walking around holding guns that are as useless as nerf guns or water guns, and they need someone who guides them which is usally the admiral, even for the pirates lol it's like this crew has 5000 crew members and this one 6000 and this one shit then luffy with his 6 or 7 crew members just come and beat the shit out of all of them. it's something like : this guy has 5000 crew members? remove three zero's and you will get how many real members are there, others are just to make the number larger Another thing I like in one piece is that there is no romance, yea not needed here just leave romance for naruto and sakura telling him I love you then he just ignores her, but honestly, there is no romance in one piece to the point where the fans became dry dude they just see nami hugging luffy and they be like SHIP SHIP I SHIP THEM SHE LOVES HIM, I remember seeing someone shipping Robin with Zoro, a 30yo with a teenager, lel imagine at the end of the anime it's like naruto or something where we find luffy and nami married and franky and robin and usopp marries chopper- and all that shit, but no problem cuz I won't even see that and the anime would be ending so meh, then Oda be like sike here is one piece shippuden In one piece there are a lot of races and stuff as I said, but there is one race that is just a punching box, nothing else just to show how powerful other characters are, a race that I don't remember seeing any strong character from, yeap it's the giants, useless trash punching boxes, lmao they just get deleted by characters that are same size as their fingers, then there is this one giant that wears a skirt and says don't look below it, also there is another punching bag in one piece, a character that is supposed to be strong and used to be strong and he has a strong fruit, now there is no character that didn't punch his face and make fun of him, a character that was super strong in the grand line and he went to the new world and he got yeeted, it's smoker-chan. back in the day when he got luffy and no-one else other than dragon came to save him Just how long Oda is planning to make it wtf like every 10 episodes you can just recap them in one 20min episode or yea we have to see luffy running after flamingo for 77 episodes just to fight him, and just in case we forget who is luffy chasing he just screams MINGOOOO. My favorite characters are teech brook and law, worst characters are smoker-chan and the 7th shichibukai and his mom and all the marine ships Fruits, the best one, of course, is the best fruit for the best character, Law's Small talks about the arcs cuz this shit is soo fucking long, I love the first arcs like west blue where they all meet and stuff, arabsta arc also is good, skypiea is too bad I skipped it, don't like the water city much, I like Thriller bark cuz of it's comedia, I don't like the amazone lily too but I might rethink about it cuz all of them are cute gir-, and don't want to see that the paramount war arc is the best cuz it's obvious, punk hazard the trash and dressrosa the two trashes, if it wasn't for flamingo there it would've been something impossible to watch, The big mom's arc and her cake is terrible except for katakori and him beating luffy for 12 episodes straight, and then now wano arc which is still going and it is not interesting at all You probably won't read all of this shit cuz I know it's fucking long but in summary I wanted to say that I enjoyed some of the time I was watching one piece, It took me 5 months to finish it, let's say I enjoyed 10 hours of that lol, I regret wasting my time in this and I won't be following it unless people say it is getting a lot better.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 28, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4cfd032a01,24
"I love the One Piece lore, but the anime... It's a chore. I've been watching it at 1.25x since around post-time skip; the pacing is absolutely horrid due to how it's scheduled compared to the manga. Some people may be able to tolerate it, but after 1000+ episodes I feel like I'm wasting my time re-watching stuff at each episode. The animation can be really great in some important episodes, but even in those the problem is jarring. A perfect example is ep1027. So what now? I've decided that after the end of the Wano Arc, I'm going to read the manga and only watch fan-cut episodes (like the One Pace project). It is a bad anime? No. Would I recommend it? Pre-time skip absolutely, afterwards just read the manga. Also, here's a breakdown of a typical One Piece episode: 2 mins opening 1 min recap 30s eyecatch 30s next episode tease 2.5mins stuff that happened in the previous episodes 3mins of still frames panning and zooming with nothing happening 1.5mins of reused frames 1min of added dialogue that consists of screaming and meaningless stuff like ""we'll see"", ""I'll kick your butt"", ""I'll defeat you"" 2min of running around and generically punching random fodder 10mins of actual episode that could be 10% faster My rating of One Piece: 10 My rating of the anime: ↓↓↓",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 20, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1406b7a199,24
I will keep it short. This anime test you peacence its so slow that you will start getting irritated. Its story is also same in most of the arcs. And when it comes to luffy he is irritating and as for side characters you will find girl with same setup and personality in every arc. Its just getting milked. And guys the power scaling this world suck you will see a character doing incredible thing and flexing (that is cring most the times) but for stretching the story the first villain beats the hero then hero gets up and wins.bro the fights are so stretched that you start getting annoying they just unnecessarily stretches the fight for no reason.

"Spoilers ahead!! It’s my first time when I write a review for an anime so I hope it will be ok. I’m going to divide this review in more pieces, each pieces focusing on a central aspect. 1. World-building(10/10) One Piece has one of the best built world in the history of animes. It explores everything you want to know. You have the Marine, which is structured from : The 5 Elders, Fleet Admiral, Admirals, Vice-Admirals,etc. Than you have the pirates, revolutionary army, bounty hunters, cp 0 – 9 ( secret police) . The map of the world, you can clearly see how the One Piece world looks like ( the 4 seas, red-line forming the grand-line) – with the New World and Grand-Line( first section). Every aspect of the story is pretty much explored and you have a general idea on how the One Piece world looks like. The power system is pretty basic ( devil fruits), but in exchange some of the fruits have really interesting power and potential ( mitical zoan fruits/ancient/special paramecia,etc). The haki system is pretty boring excepting the conqueror haki which I find very interesting and have a lot of potential to develop in the future. 2. Characters (10/10) I know, I know, One piece doesn’t have a lot of character development over the time and the characters remain pretty much the same (for example Luffy personality and mindset remains the same from the beginning of the story). But what makes Luffy such a good mc is the fact that he is an enjoyable character. One Piece is very good at making background for the characters ( by this I mean the backstories). They all have very interesting background with the saddest backstories I have ever seen. The One Piece backstories are just something different man. The connections and the relationships between the characters are very well written while the story develops. I find Luffy to be a character that doesn’t really develops over time ( except when his brother decides to open a donut shop and he realizes he’s too weak to protect his nakama). Instead, Luffy helps other characters to develop ( Katakuri, Sanji, Robin, Nami, etc). And it’s not the Naruto type character that uses Talk No Jutsu to change other people mindset. I like to think that Naruto speaks and Luffy takes action. Anyways, this is not a Luffy character review, but the idea is that Oda knows how to make characters enjoyable and unique in their own way, and I like this. 3. Pacing (1/10) To be clear, I am talking know about the anime, not the manga. The pacing is shit. That’s all. 4. Art style (9/10) The One Piece art style is very unique, every single character having a unique new feature, making them so different. It’s very fitting for the series, giving it this adventurous vibe because you always find new original characters( except for girls, they all fucking have Nami face, and I’m not gonna talk about Big Mom). 5. Animation (8/10) If we only consider the animation until the beginning of the Whole Cake Island Arc, it will be like a 6-7, but from WC is starts improving drastically. Camera angles, lights, character’s action and movements and overall style of animation got better. The Wano Arc has a very clean and cool animation and One Piece finally got what it deserved. 6. Storytelling(10/10) Eiichiro Oda is an amazing storyteller. Foreshadows, character arcs, symbolism, problems and conflicts from the current society ( corruption, discrimination, jobbery, false appearance over realistic self, human meat market, slavery, child abuse, etc), all of this gives the story a fiction look, but in the same time a realistic one, being in a way inspired from the real world. The story is amazing, with a lot of mysteries and questions from the fans around the world. Lots of theories have been made in the last couple of years. 7. Overall – Objective (8/10) Subjective(10/10) This is the only anime that made me think more about what the author wanted to say with that scene/quote. I know I am biased but for me One Piece is 10/10 anime and I can’t wait to see how the story develops and it’s ending (if it’s going to exist one).",10,Recommended,"Sep 5, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdf42f2f75,24
"I love this anime most people hate it because of its length however if you stick with it you will realise why its one of the best anime out there Storyline (10/10) When i first started this anime i didn't expect the storyline to be this good however you will love it. And as you go on watching it the storyline will get better Animation and pacing (6/10) When it comes to animation toei kinda ruined it however it gets better in further episodes but unfortunately the pacing of this anime never got better another reason why people hate this anime is its pacing so i recommend manga Characters (10/10) There are lot of characters in one piece and every character is useful unlike some animes out there where most characters are totally useless and i like how no characters are forgotten whether its a side character or a annoying antagonist Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed everything about it the storytelling, world building etc. But again the pacing is really bad especially when you catch up with it Overall (9/10) -1 because of the pacing XD (btw its worth watching however i recommend manga)",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdaac80b73,24
"I always brushed one piece off as a weird looking show with a strange hat boi as an mc. I didn’t decide to give it a try until my friend told me he watched over 500 episodes and never got bored. I decided to give a watch and immediately was hooked in with Luffy’s smile And charisma. At a first glance I’ll admit it, the characters in one piece look really strange. But once you learn of the past and story’s it immediately changes the way you see them and you can see how Oda get better and better at doing this as the series progresses. An example could be Zoro. Zoro seems like a street rat that uses 3 swords for whatever reason but until you learn about how he got stuck bounty hunting and his past with Kuina your perception of him really does change. The world that one piece is set in is one of the stupidest but also the smartest. I say this because there are so many places or islands that have a fully functional Government but when it comes to looks it just goes all over the place but I think this is what keeps me so interested in this world. With every new area you discover it fells like a breath of fresh air from the last place. This really helps you stay hooked and invested in the worlds setting. Overall I would say one piece is one of the best shows I have experienced. From its happy look to its sometimes heartbreaking back stories. This show stays consistently good throughout the majority of the series and kept me flipping pages and watch episode after episode.",10,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d31a6e99d8,24
"One Piece is an amazing anime, in terms of world-building, character development and it is filled with a very deep storyline. It contains awesome action, adventures, comedic moments. It is long because it builds up the world of One Piece and its characters and you can look back on how far they have all come from once it all ends. There are so many great things to look back to at every arc which always makes One Piece very interesting. There are hundreds of characters who are all interesting and have their own backstories. The adventures that the main characters go to are always intriguing such as fighting new enemies, meeting new friends, exploring the world, and stumbling upon new mysteries. The One Piece mysteries always have fans coming up with their own theories, but Oda has planned it all from the very beginning and gives the audience some clue by using foreshadowing. The world of One Piece shows us every human can be good or evil such as pirates can be good and help people and navy soldiers can be evil and corrupt. Every villain has their own sets of ideas and backstories to the world, and all have unique fighting styles. The protagonists being the Straw Hat Pirates all have their own dreams and goals. Every member has their own way of excelling in a fight. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but they are all useful to the overall story. Some members are extremely strong physically and can fight very well but not as strong mentally, while others are geniuses but don't possess monstrous physical strengths. All the members are lovable each having their own interesting and sad backstories which lead to them pursuing their own dreams while helping Luffy to become the Pirate King and finding One Piece. The supporting characters of each arc all get their chance to shine, no one seems to be left out in the story, they all have a part to play in the overall outcome. I'd say Oda is a genius for creating One Piece and Luffy as its protagonist who is both extremely strong, funny, and interesting. Luffy's fighting style is so creative and versatile because he has the powers of rubber man. It always comes in handy in a fight or almost any given situation. Luffy will always find a way to win fights using his creative rubber powers, extremely strong will and keen intellect in battles. The soundtrack and music in the opening and ending are also awe-inspiring which gives out so many emotions to the series. The animation has been well done considering is an older anime, the art style is unique and different from other shows where Oda draws creatures possessing all sorts of forms. I personally really love Oda’s art style which gives every character its beauty both female and male characters. Finally, the show gave me the most emotions through its long journey. I have felt excitement, happiness, sadness, and anger throughout the whole series through its character, battles, emotional scenes, soundtrack. I have never cried so much for an anime and there are countless emotional and beautiful moments in One Piece.

"One Piece is an adventure, and its a very straightforward one, One Piece proves you don't need very complex plot to be good, it has a lot of memorable moments and until now the story is still good and thank Oda for that. However the pacing is what really kills me the most, especially on newer episodes where the pacing is slow as snails since they can't outpace the manga, Usually slower pacing isn't a killer except its on anime that's on 1000 episodes and could have easily been a hundred of episodes shorter if it wasn't for the bad pacing they've been doing. By all means, this is a preference, you'll still enjoy the most of it early on without worrying about the bad pacing too much but you'll definitely notice it later on.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 27, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_db7a98e014,25
"Let’s talk about One Piece. Now, why would anyone in their right mind watch, as of this review, 588 episodes -- 8 days of their life (if you watch 24 hours a day) -- on one anime which shows no signs of ending anytime in the next 10 years? In my humble opinion: because One Piece is the paramount serial anime series on the planet. I cannot imagine any other series captivating my attention from the first episode and holding it for so long. There are always new and exciting things to discover, and the stories of each crew member will make you love them for all eternity. Other crew members aside, Luffy is the reason this show is so amazing; he is the greatest main character in any series. His funny and light attitude makes the show enormously entertaining, and it contrasts and intensifies his strong emotions when he truly gets serious. Of course, the fight scenes are amazing and seeing new devil’s fruits or new techniques (especially some around the halfway mark :D ), will make your heart soar with excitement. The way that Oda (writer of the original manga) has created a world where the crew can go into any environment and find any enemy with any power, while still progressing the story, is complete genius. I have laughed, cried and jumped for joy while watching this show and I won’t be stopping anytime soon. But beware; once you start you won’t be able to stop.

Having liked the episodes shown on Cartoon Network as a kid, One Piece was always a name familiar to me. This series is outstanding. It is a bit slow moving at first, but it picks up tremendously. The character development is outstanding, and you really feel like you are right there with the characters. Through times of happiness and sorrow, you are moved by the characters and grow near personal bonds with them.

"One Piece is an excellent show. It's exceedingly funny and I guarantee that you will laugh. The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them. First there's Monkey D. Luffy, who is this optimistic boy that can stretch his body thanks to a Gum-Gum fruit he ate as a child. He's the captain. Then there's the sarcastic sword master, Roronoa Zolo, who practices santoryu, which means he uses three swords at once. He is the first mate. Nami is the third member to join the crew. She's a thief who hates almost all pirates with a passion, but adores money. She's the navigator. Usopp is the fourth crew member. He's a total scaredy-cat and always tells lies. He's the crew's sharpshooter. The fifth crewman is Sanji, who's a serious ladies' man. He is the cook. And then there's Tony Tony Chopper, who is...a reindeer. He's just a tad shy. He's the crew's doctor. There might be more crew members, but I don't know of any others. They're all really interesting, but the enemies are just absurd. Every time you see a new one you have to stare at it for a minute or so just to figure out whether he's wearing a wig, or if that's REALLY his outfit. The storyline is great and the music makes me smile. Even if you don't obsess over pirates like I do, you will love this show.

"""What? You still haven't seen One Piece?"" That's the response I always get when meeting fellow anime fans once they ask me about One Piece. And then after that, they'd proceed and tell me reasons why I should watch it now. I know that it's good. I heard a lot of positive reviews about it after all. But what discouraged me from picking it up (which I'm sure might also the reason those who still haven't seen One Piece have no plans to do so) is the number of episodes. It's A LOT and unless you're really dedicated and patient, that won't sit well with you. Well, guess what? The reason why I didn't want to watch it in the first place became the main reason why I love it. I'm so glad I didn't let it discourage me from trying it out! And so, after three months and one week of marathoning this anime, I finally caught up with the latest episode when this review was written which was episode 831. Wow, what a ride. One Piece has everything I love about anime--enthralling world, captivating plot, mind-blowing twists, fascinating and relatable characters, heart-stopping actions, heartbreaking deaths, and more. That's why in no time, One Piece became one of my most favorite anime of all time. Thanks to the huge number of episodes, you can really get attached to the SH crew and other notable characters to the point where you can't imagine life without them. From the first episode, I immediately knew my life was about to change now that I discovered this treasure. The world it offers is really beautiful. The parallels that are compared to real life are just simply brilliant. Don't even get me started with the plot. This plus the plot twists are strengths of One Piece. Every arc will surely get you hooked and after watching an episode, it'll make you want for more. Great characters too. The backstories are relatable and you can really sympathize with them. You'll get attached to them that's why the deaths are really heartbreaking. There was a character's death where it took me three weeks before I had the strength to continue watching the series! That's how in love I am with this anime and not everyone can do that so good job Oda! The actions are great too. There are times when I felt like my heart would stop in suspense. I just wish they'd shorten it though. There were a lot of times where I skipped some scenes because it felt like the animators were just dragging it (which is probably the real case). As for the soundtracks, well it's good but most of the opening and ending songs are forgettable for me. It's not enough to catch my attention and convince me not to skip it. However, there are notable opening songs as well that I didn't skip at all. Overall, One Piece is one of the best anime of all time for me. It deserves all the success and praise it receives! A true classic, indeed. So don't hesitate and just jump right in!

"I'm writing this review as a huge fan of the franchise and it has really special part in my heart. It's been almost 8 years since I've started to series and I'm following the current for 5 years. The most of the negative comments are to anime, not to manga. Story: 9 May be the story of the main characters can't get you but the background story and the connections between events and characters, for me this is the strongest part of the franchise. Pacing is a bit problem in the manga too but in the anime it's ridiculously slow. Generally the ratio of episodes of anime and manga is 1:2 or 1:3 (1 anime episode=2 or 3 manga episodes), but after the time-skip, in One Piece, this ratio becomes 1:1 or even 1:0,5 (yes, 1 anime episdoe=0,5 manga episode). This is the worst point of the anime. Art: 7 Oda was still young when he started to draw the manga, so the art is ""meh"" at the start, but it improves day by day. I wish I could say same about the anime, yes it improves but due to weekly schedule, it is not attentive. Sound: 6 There is few soundtracks that I really liked but most them is just average, I have to say that I really dislike/hate some of the sound effects of the objects or characters. Character: 8 There is 1000+ characters, since the cast is that much, you can easliy find some chacters that you'll like or even love. Enjoyment: 9 As I said before, this franchise is really special for me. I enjoyed almost every moment while watching or reading. But approximately the last 150 episodes (which is during Dressrosa Arc and Whole Cake Island Arc) I really couldn't enjoy because of the excessive filler and empty scenes. It is unavoidale due to weekly schedule of both anime and manga. Overall: 3 Yes I gave high scores for elements but I give overall 3. If you really want to get into the franchise, the best way is manga (personally I recommend colored manga), but anime wasn't bad adaptasion until time-skip event. I recommend you to watch until time-skip (of course you don't have to watch fillers) and then get into manga.",3,Not Recommended,"May 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a2905dc87e,25
"One piece is a weird anime to rate because you can't give all 1000 episodes a single rating. Especially since it downgraded so badly in the last few years. Before the time skip one piece was an absolute master piece, a perfect 10/10 anime with just the perfect amount of action comedy and drama. After the time skip it doesn't even deserve a 4/10, it has a good moment every 50 or so episodes. I truly believe that if it was rated per arc we will see Arabasta, Enies Lobby, White beard war, and some some others in the top rated anime of all time.

The characters in One Piece are top class, they just are so well developed with such good back stories.

"Ok, my first anime's were naruto, bleach, and d-grayman. I'd always talk to my friends at school about them and debate and discuss plot elements, characters, etc. However, over our senior trip they started talking about an anime they loved very much and praised more than Bleach at times: it was called One Piece. Now, i'm a bleach die-hard fan so when they kept praising this show i kept thinking ""Whats the big deal?"" I'd heard a bit about One Piece but not too much and i thought it was kinda baby compared to bleach or d-grayman. I also heard how long it was which really raised some doubts. I mean c'mon 400+ episodes long!? how can anything even go for a span as long as that?! I thought it was an overestimated, watered down anime, so when i finally began watching it after yu-yu-hakusho mid-summer i had my doubts and didn't expect much. Please permit me to say it now: I AM SO SORRY. I TAKE IT ALL BACK. One Piece is amazing. Period. The characters I found were likable and before you knew it became like a family, true nakama. The humor was greatly done and made me chuckle all the way through. Now the plot did take a bit to pick up with the actual story, but it didnt matter! The individual adventures were enjoyable and did well with pacing themselves out, even if alabastar and skypiea were a bit long. While the animation was kinda rugged in the biggining (which isnt bad at all considering it was 1999) it picked up nicely after skypiea and looked great. Now it wasnt perfect, it was a bit hard to develope a epic atmosphere at times during some of the arcs due to the more humor bases of the anime (ex. zoros fight with the giraffe was mainly goofing off and the big bad guy for chopper was kinda dumb) but it definatley has its epic moments, even more so than other anime. I sitll go back and watch Luffy kick the crap out of Crocodile and be amazing in his fight against Lucci (he will not fall, so epic!) Oh and while we're on Luffy can i say how much of a man he is! i mean when he climbed that huge mountain to save his nakama or the many other amazing things he did, aw man! And the rest of the crew too! ( if i went into it this would go on forever...oh wait too late, sorry) However one of the greatest things this anime has displays is the true meaning of nakama. The scene were nami is stabbing herself and throwing sand at luffy telling him to go way, and then cries and asks for his help. Aw man the hat symbolism, ""You are my nakama i will protect you"" i still go back and watch that. Each adventure showed more an more of the One Piece universe and made me fall in love with the crew more and more. Oh and the length, *ahem* Naruto, Bleach, you two have no right to complain anymore!!!!!! I dont want to hear it about the ""We need more fillers to let the manga get farther"" crap. I thoughtr fillers were there to serve that purpose, until i watched One Piece. 478 episodes and only 40 filler! (AT the most!) And its til way behind the manga from wat ive heard! I dont want to hear it anymore Bleach. (already gave up on naruto anime, read manga) Another great thing about One Piece is that it is very ingenuative. In the early episodes of say, Bleach, the characters had special powers and used them to cunningly beat their enemies, like ishida and Rengi's team up against the number 8 espada. But then it turned int okinda just a bunch of ""power battles"" like DBZ where whoever is strongest wins. (btw Bleach is my fav anime so dont think i hate it its just its kinda grating where it is) One Piece, however, has ingenuity all the way through and doesnt rely on just power battles. When Luffy's enemy can read his mind and predict his movements he decides to punch the wall behind him and let his attacks ricochet all over so the enemy cant read it, or Ussop tricking his enemy into unconsciousness when she coudve overpowered him easy. But dont think its just a bunch of weaklings who hav to outsmart everyone, they are strong too! Like the Groggy Ball where sanji and Zoro team up to totally overpower the competition or Luffy's first use of Gear Second. (Still love that) Oh and about that in particular, it doesnt get waterted down the moe he used it. Like in Bleach, Bankai is just another power everyone has and has kinda got watered down, but when Luffy initiated Gear Second you just know its gonna be epic and powerful. The humor was also very welcomed as it seemed to help move the plot along since it was so long. Overall I was very impressed with the series as a whole and cant wait for the new episodes every week. One Piece was the most pleasant surprise thats ever happened to me. Great characters, solid story, uplifting overall atmosphere, epic battles, good humor, it has it all! Im very, very sad that i hav caught up and will now hav to wait every week but i can truely say it has been a fantastic adventure that i will never forget.

"One Piece. The Treasure Of Shounen Anime? One Piece is a PG 13 tale of adventure and comedy. It has been around since 1999 and the author said it is only half way done. It's no surprise this anime is in the top big 3! The One Piece story is a simple story about a kid named Monkey D Luffy with a dream to become the Pirate King and to obtain the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. The first couple of arcs is basically getting his powerful, witty crew together. Usually when an anime is introducing main characters there is little action, but not in the case of this one. Whether he had one partner or five The Straw Hat Crew (Luffy's Crew) always managed to stay in trouble. This anime is not just about it's action or wise crack moments, but it also get intense and will have you in tears (personal experience) as more of the story and mystery unravels. The art of this show throws some people off because it is not like the usually anime style, but looks cartoonish. I love the art and actually a lot of shows before the 2000's especially in the 70's and 80's looked like One Piece. I think it's art gives it unique style an easily distinguished it from the rest. The sound is where I have mixed views. If you watched this is dub I am so sorry and I know how you are skeptical of watching this show, but that was 4Kids dub. They chopped up the anime and made the voices younger like so it would appeal to kids. That is why I recommend skipping dub all together in this anime. Even the FUNimation dubbed is not finished and not worth watching. Please watch this anime in sub to get a taste of what the anime is really supposed to be like. Besides the Voice Actors do a splendid job. As for theme music I missed the first opening. I felt it went really well with the pirate them. I like the other openings as songs, but it really doesn't fit the adventure mood. The characters are something else. They are cliched yet not cliche and it's really hard to explain. I do not want to spoil it so I will only tell you that the characters each have their own special personality and this show works a great deal of showing their backgrounds. Even minor characters are not neglected in the show and you grow to love them like you grow to love the main characters. Overall I loved this anime and I recommend it to a person who loves to laugh, cry, and be overwhelmed with other emotions through the long ride.",8,Recommended,"Jun 19, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ef4a0774c7,25
"Why One Piece is the Best Action-Adventure Shonen of Recent Years If you’re looking for the ultimate action-adventure anime, One Piece is the undisputed king of the genre. With its rich world-building, deep storytelling, and unforgettable characters, Eiichiro Oda has created a masterpiece that has captivated fans for decades. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with the dream of becoming the Pirate King. Alongside his loyal crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, he embarks on an epic journey across the Grand Line, facing powerful foes, uncovering ancient mysteries, and forming bonds that define the essence of true adventure. What makes One Piece stand out is its perfect blend of action, humor, and emotional depth. The battles are intense, the lore is incredibly detailed, and every arc builds upon the last, making the journey feel grander with each episode. The character development is unmatched, and the emotional moments hit hard, proving that One Piece is more than just a typical shonen.

After watching, I started having less interest on average type of shonen anime except for Fairy Tail. Don't be misguided by ""A rubberman who wants find a treasure"" plot. The story has so many possibilities. Nevermind the art. I think it has the same art style as dragonball. People always says that Dragonball is like the greatest anime ever but I think One Piece is. It has the same quality of fight scenes, humor, art as dragonball but One Piece has a more deeper story line than dragonball. Since episode 1, the story of One Piece has only one goal that becomes broad and deep as the story progress unlike dragonball which is mostly about fighting every enemies that tries to invade planet earth. One Piece also has a great character development. Even supporting characters that you thought won't show up still shows up adding a great influence to the storyline.

"I started watching One Piece a little more than a year ago now, and I binged at least 560 episodes. probably more, but that's the actual number I feel comfortable sitting at. Honestly, I think for being the most popular Manga and Anime out there, selling the most in Japan and extremely popular overseas it's very overrated. I honestly was excited to start the show and see what it was all about, I even read the first 3 volumes of the manga but was never interested in actually continuing with that, so I can really only speak from the perspective I have after watching the Anime. There might be reasons (there probably are considering some of my problems with One Piece the Anime) that don't apply to the experience of the Manga which is fair in it's own right. But the problem with the Anime adaption is that I was put off from even wanting to approach the Manga at all. I will explain. I got quite a way through the show, as of writing this review there are 920 episodes, but I stopped watching somewhere in mid to late 2018, the point being that i've watch enough of the show to with this sample size (more than half of the episodes which have currently aired) to discuss the show and not be rebuked for not having given it enough of a chance. Make of that what you will, but I have had, frankly, the displeasure and boredom of putting up with the show until I just couldn't stand it anymore which is partially certainly the result of the show, as it totally fails to engage you whatsoever. I don't hold the opinion that it gets much better. From some of the other negative reviews it seems that if anything, it just gets worse. And that's where I begin, I got so far into the show, I was excited, but at some point a few hundred episodes in I realised that my excitement was wasted. I kept wondering ""when is the show going to actually start"", then I realised. . .This is the entire show. The feeling I got was that the show is a constant setup for the real plot, but that's not true. What feels like the never ending build up of lackluster character introductions that last for 20-30 episodes each (like what's his name, the skeleton guy) is actually JUST THE SHOW. Nothing comes from this constant set-up, hence why it's technically wrong. There is no ""real"" plot. I got bored of the easily forgettable island escapades that have god awful amounts of episodes where each character fights their own individual enemy for 20 episodes each, I'm thinking specifically of some train car battle just prior to the time skip on episode 517, hell it might've even been after the time skip. Also another instance which sticks out painfully is Luffy's constant fighting with ""Foxy"", a character I looked up just now because I remembered the only outstanding feature during this god awful ""arc"" (which I learned was an arc just now after having looked it up, god help me) was that Luffy turned into Muhammad Ali with an Afro and boxing gloves. They meet a couple of times, Luffy gets his ass handed to him, it's terribly drawn out and boring, repetitive and couldn't even be droll. I just wanted to skip it, but hoped that perhaps it'd either end quicker or get better, but it simply never did. I don't remember much about this arc or any other, besides the fact the villain was annoying and I couldn't stand his constant reappearance. These are the other problems. The show to me was ultimately forgettable; hence the reason I don't bother to look up the names of some of the straw hat pirates, like the Skeleton dude, I just honestly do not remember his name and I want that to illustrate that point. All the arcs merged together, I cannot tell you which they were or what was accomplished other than some sappy emotional nonsense, like when Robot guy has a relationship with old ugly mermaid woman....And...Something to do with Dolphins? I don't remember. But I do remember that Usop was angry at Luffy for some reason and they fought but it was resolved and everything was fine. To be fair, I do remember that eliciting some emotion from me but like the rest it was ultimately plain. To kind of sum up, I found the show repetitive, drawn out, perhaps not uninspired as the set pieces and overall design is really great, but the story certainly isn't anything special. At least to me. The Characters are very one dimensional. That's probably what makes the show less than average. All of them struck me as extremely boring, with only one defining character trait and many other character deficiencies. Luffy likes food and wants to be king of the pirates, he's utterly oblivious to any of the other characters and what little emotions they manage to squeeze out of their thin outlines. He seemingly only has 3 emotions: happily annoying, angry and sad. He has the same amount of ""character traits"", such as: being dumb, being hungry, being a contrived leader nobody seems to respect. Probably more, but I don't remember. Although it was kinda neat to see how Luffy reacted when his brother predictably dies, however it was a let down when he just gets so sad he freezes up. I didn't feel much at that moment despite all the tension. As for the others Nami is a money hungry whore, maybe not a whore but definitely a tease. Nico Robin is a mummy gf in her 30s, skeleton man (who i thought was named ""Frank"" but is actually ""Brook"" and the mech man is actually ""Franky"", yeah, I looked it up this time) is dead and he's obnoxiously ranting about that fact whenever he can, which is supposed to be funny but comes off as annoying because it wasn't used sparingly and it ended up becoming his character instead of being a character tick which defined his character in some meaningful way. It never came off like an insecurity for example, even though I think it was supposed to be? Anyway. There's Sanji who's presumably a wannabe manwhore, but is just a perverted virgin (not that there's anything wrong with that), at least he can cook but he's an utter simp so he has no luck whatsoever. Zoro. He's cool. But that's just it. He's cool and apathetic which are just adjectives for ""boring"". The others I don't care about, they're not important, Tony² Chopper is the inserted ""cute"" character, he's a deer, but everyone thinks he's a dog. They play this joke so hard I actually started to forget while writing this that he actually WASN'T a dog. I don't even think they ever actually say what he clearly is in the entire show, at least not the 560 episodes I subjected myself to. I remember a certain part that at the same time i've forgotten, where finally, Sanji did something perverted, and subsequently he said he loved Nico, or Nami, I don't remember the full situation, what happened or what was said, but that's the foggy memory I have. But while watching it, there was a brief second where I finally thought the characters would actually interact and there would be some kind of bonding, perhaps Sanji would be rejected but the girls would try and understand him a little bit or whatever. Just dig a bit deeper, I'm not a writer, I don't know what they should've done I'm just saying I expected more. But they did none of this, Sanji just reverted back to his paperthin one dimensional pervert character trait, and Nico or something hit him and called him a perv. It was at that moment it struck me about One Piece what it was I couldn't connect with, and it was the characters because they never really connect with each other and FEEL like a crew. They do display emotions, sure, but usually (from what I remember) in their introductions when they interact with characters from their past, or in memories. Like Nico and her mother, or Nami and her Sister?? The crew never interacts in a way with each other that makes them feel like they're all a crew that wants to be there and has a stake in the plot. Even if that plot is just travelling a set course to multiple locations while wacky shenanigans occur, creating a kind of scooby doo effect where the characters split off and unite at the end where they leave. wash rinse repeat. There's just no character development whatsoever, none of them, especially Luffy for a main protagonist utterly fails to actually grow as a character. Learn lessons, reflect, have moments honest and true with the enemies he faces alone or with the other Straw Hats (an exception might be his defense of Nami early on). They all as characters stay stagnant and stale, they might grow for an episode but simply revert back to the way they were before in order to hamfist the same ""development"" whenever utilised in another episode down the road as to seemingly avoid continuous character growth. This is almost to be expected when the story is so lightly sketched in that it barely has an outline. What comes first? The story or the characters? Does the characters shape the story or does the story shape the characters? This reminds me of Socrates and his dismantling of Euthyphro's explanation of Piety. The point is that no characters can develop in a setting like this despite the fact you'd actually think there would be plenty of development considering it's a story about Pirates with a vast world of characters and explorable possibilities within the genre especially when including the numerous liberties Oda takes while telling a ""story"" inside this ""genre"" to begin with. What I mean is that ""pirates"" seemingly have very little to do with the show and is more window dressing for the audience than anything but it barely even sticks to such things considering how ridiculous One Piece can get. Merging many genres and in so doing inserting out of place elements like robots. In any case there's a lot of creativity but Oda never utilises it for producing characters and story which contain substance. It's all flare, and it's boring. I wanted something more, but what I got was overrated. I never got the feeling that they overcame their selfish reasons for joining the crew, and indeed this is true, hence why they all split up and there's a timeskip. But even after the awfully long time it takes for the plot to basically fill up time by REINTRODUCING these same characters 4 years later or whatever, it still feels soulless. The ""story"" is much less like a comprehensive adventure which takes you on a wild ride, than it is a show with arcs that essentially act as the same every time you view them but with simple changes in scenery. 1) Straw Hats reach the next Island 2) Meet locals. 3) Discover that there's a problem 4) Help solve the problem 4) Receive praise and take on another crewmate 5) Leave. 6) Repeat. Because the path to the ""One Piece"" is already mapped out with islands there's little attention payed onto how they get somewhere, finding it, and the trials and tribulations it would take to to achieve all that. Every other pirate who's looking for the One Piece is on the same course and this is where the conflict arises, not out the actual Journey itself and how hard that would be, but the simple vapid criminals the Straw Hats come across along the way. There's no strategy or mystery (besides what the One Piece actually is) to define the show and help it evolve and shape the characters into something unique and interesting. It's not like Deathnote for example, which has a perfect plot where mystery is a factor EVEN WHEN you as the viewer see everything the characters on both sides see. One Piece cannot even manage a one sided mystery. Because let's be honest, how many people who watch One Piece do it because they're enthralled at finding out what the ""One Piece"" actually is? Not many I'd dare say. So what about the show is alluring to people? The answer? I don't know. Read their reviews, some of the ones i've seen are kind of vapid and praise generalities about the characters which really don't exist. Invoking Odas sob stories he inserts to create the facade of Characters who're deeper than they otherwise act. I don't really have anything more to say, other than One Piece is the ONLY anime i've watched that's actually left me with nothing that stands out, or to take away. And what does, even a little bit, is the bad taste that was left in my mouth; which doesn't strike me as a good sign. Maybe the Manga is better, but frankly I cannot be arsed to bother when it might take me lord knows how long for it to ""get good"" over 95 volumes. I didn't write this review so anyone might not watch it, although that's a possibility of course. It's worth watching to see IF YOU like it. If you do, hey that's cool. But I didn't, I really fail to see the appeal and what anyone actually gets from it. I don't see the story going anywhere, there isn't much of one as far as I can tell, besides the goals the characters have, as to how any of those will be interesting I don't know. But overall One Piece just didn't do it for me.",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 10, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d7a78d1be2,25
"Okay. One Piece, is easily the best anime I've seen so far. And I doubt I'll come across an anime better than OP. When I started watching OP, it was interesting. But it got boring quickly. I even dropped it around ep 50. But thanks to my cousin, who pushed me to continue watching, I continued. It were a long, hundred some episodes I watched without really wanting to watch it. But it paid off. From there on, it became ridiculously great real quick. The story is what got me hooked in the first place, and the story just kept on progressing and progressing. The character development is outstanding, the emotional part is outstanding, and man, the comedy, is OUT. STANDING. I don't know how many times I've died laughing. And the potential of this anime is great, so it will only keep getting better and better.

May be a bit long with 575 episodes since the time of writing of this review, but it is totally worth it. Great character development. Love Nakama power. Fighting is awesome as well as the powers. Very funny at the best of times and is very hard to stop watching once you get into it.

"One Piece, a series that is often viewed as being to long and convoluted by certain individuals in the community, and seen by others as the golden standard for an anime, with arguably the most fanatic fans of any anime. One Piece to me, like many others, was my gate way series and I while I believe it is very good, there are many flaws that can definitely not be overlooked. The main pros of this series its world building, being able to introduce new exciting islands from the winter island called Drum Island to the desert kingdom of Alabasta, the world building of the different pirate crews and countries is fascinating, and while albeit a little repetitive, still somehow keeps your attention for majority of the time. The characters themselves are also phenomenal, with some of multiple of my favourite backstories coming from this series alone, and while people may not see the conventional ""big Eren like personality shift"" Oda is able to subtly change their actions while still sticking to the core of their characters. To go along with a well thought out and ever evolving story, this show has remained a thrilling ride for around 25 years, however, the anime in particular has certain issues that bring down its rating. The weakness of the One Piece anime is of course its pacing and its animation (up till Wano at least). Of course Toei had a lot to deal with as it came up every week, but the filler in between episodes and the subpar to downright bad animation made it hard to get through, particularly the Dressrosa arc. The art in the manga is pretty good but the animation was bad for decades before Wano came and made it one of the best animated shonen. Another problem is that One Piece is so long that certain parts of the series that foreshadows certain events or that give certain characters development is often forgotten, this means that a lot of details aren't remembered which allows for people to criticise, criticism that may not exist if they remembered the whole story. Of course this is a weakness as Oda did not do a good enough job at making an impression, concepts such as bounty hunters are also forgotten or extremely undeveloped. Overall, this will always have a spot in my heart and will be one of my favourite anime, however, there are multiple weaknesses that prevent it from being the top tier.",8,Recommended,"Feb 17, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1b61a46d23,25
"I started watching One Piece around January of 2021, as a joke. The idea was, I knew most of my friend group would end up watching it someday, and that I could just spring it on them that I've seen the whole show upon being caught up with it, and threaten them with spoilers. Obviously that sounds like a stupid joke, but it basically meant that for watching One Piece, this big 1,000 episode show, not only would I get what enjoyment it must contain to keep it alive so long, but I could bully my friends with it, which means I had more motive to watch it and sit through it, yet I still couldn't make it to episode 200, even while skipping filler, it was just too slow and boring. Story: 2/10 The story was actually really interesting and captivating until shortly after they enter the Grand Line. I loved it and within the first 100 episodes I had the show as an 8. But even I noticed during the Alabasta arc that the show was becoming too slow-paced for me. I made it through the Alabasta arc, skipped the filler, and set my sights on the Skypiea arc. It was really good, until they all got trapped in the Upper Yard. Once that happened it became BORING AS HELL. I was all hyped to see God Eneru and learn about his powers, and how he usurped Gan Fall, and the lore behind the Shandians, but there were a good 4 or 5 fights that had villains like Yama, Luffy just being lost and not getting any screen time, Chopper being dumb and asking a deadly villain to ""please not damage the ship"" and ""please don't hurt me"", and it was just too boring. ""OH MY GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!"" I cried but to no answer. So I dropped it. Art: 3/10 The art was pretty interesting, I didn't like it or dislike it, but the animation quality from the beginning to where I quit the show makes it a 5. It can still be impressive. The character design for main characters is great, but for side characters it isn't so fantastic. We have characters like Igaram, Yama, Satori, Hotori/Kotori, etc, which are just annoying to look it, it's like Eiichiro Oda thought ""Hmm you know what? You know those people that watch my show? Fuck them, they can kill themselves,"" while proceeding to draw large circles, give them faces, and call it a night. I'm going to count that against this rating instead of the characters one though, so the art is a 3 for me. Sound: 7/10 The sound was pretty good. It wasn't trash, they had a couple tracks that definitely added to the scenes, some that made everything on screen annoying. The openings and endings though were fucking FABULOUS. I always force myself to watch openings and endings all the way through, sometimes against my own will, but I never once wanted to skip a One Piece opening or ending. It's what I'll miss most about the show. Character: 7/10 The characters were good. The backstories of the main characters were intricate and well-composed, not the ""my parents died and I've been all alone"" backstories you see in a lot of popular Shonen anime. Enjoyment: 3/10 Like I said with the story, it is super good, like an 8 or a 9 until after the Alabasta arc. But unlike the story which immediately shoots down around 1/3 through Skypiea, the enjoyment slowly declines starting about halfway through Alabasta. Overall: 5/10 That is what all of my scores average out to. If you are considering watching this show, watch it on Netflix, because Netflix has all the way up through the Alabasta arc, episode 130. It only stays good for a little bit after that.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 12, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a91433154,25

"The closest piece of fiction to the on point definition of a 'masterpiece'. It has its faults, it has its issues, but the positives for this show outshine the negatives once you watch/read this series. most people say 'it's to long' or 'the pacing sucks' or 'the anime art style is bad/bad animation' and my main response to all three is - read the manga. But since this is the anime version here are my reasons for why personally, I didn't mind these 'issues' + When watching it felt 'to short'. It's way of bringing me in and keeping me engaged - while i will admit there were points where it got boring, the feeling that after this boring patch something exciting would come through kept me going, the Long ring Long island arc, Ocean dream and Foxys return arcs, I remember was the arcs where I almost dropped it entirely, but I kept pushing, hoping it would reach the peaks it was hitting like in the alabasta saga. And, well, BOOM. Water 7 and Enies Lobby followed, two of the best arcs in the series and some of my personal favourites of any arc from anime entirely. + The pacing - well I can admit this is the main issue I kind of noticed while watching and can admit this was an actual issue I can't say I had a personal difference with, but I can point back to the to short argument, the fact that the arcs may be long and feel long but most of the arcs almost have you ignoring that factor as they bring you in with ease. + The anme art style/animation argument - well this is just a subjective argument, and I can't really say much to combat this as it is a personal thing, but the main thing that kept me going with the bad animation/art styles was the fact that the storylines,villains,characters, places, the vibrant feeling of each individual interaction kept me in it, the overall homeliness and comfort you gain as you watch and start to grow connections to the characters is priceless - to the point the animation or art style doesn't matter.

"Needless to say, it is one of the most iconic and longest running shows of all time, spanning up to 1000+ episodes as of writing this and it is not a bad time investment in my opinion for entertainment if you are into the classic, shounen type of anime. I wouldn't say that it's LIFE-CHANGING but its definitely a good/fun watch and is quite action-packed for what it is. Animation (7/10) - Over the years it saw a steady adaptation to the standards of the industry; It can be really easy to tell what year were the episodes were released just from eyeballing its quality. So in totality it doesn't have a steady line of trademark, its more of an evolutionary thing for the eras' it goes along with as its runtime continues. I wouldn't say they have something masterpiece-like going on, but its not terrible considering they release weekly too. Storyline (8/10) - I think they are doing a good job, gradually showing Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates' progression as they go along; It is very rich in unique and personable characters (even for the filler episode ones!) whether may they be friends or villains. They are quite easy to digest too. But the problem I have is, the pacing of their storytelling is way too slow. That's why it has over a thousand episodes, and I feel like it could be faster, not gonna lie. Music (8/10) - They have a lot of memorable and catchy soundtracks over the years; Whether it may be songs or the ones used for battles; It typically fit its introspection of adventure, action and pursuit of legacy in general. Heavily forefronts trumpets for its orchestration backed by violins, strings and woodwinds. Very trademarked on how they produced their pieces which gives them distinct identity. Although minor concern, they lack a little bit of versatility since their compositions have already been established.

Cons. - It has filler episodes mixed with canon content, so you'll have to swallow those if you want the full picture. - The production as of now has been slowed down due to previous point, so for a series as long as this, waiting could be a turn down. - For a creation as big as this one, you may find some plot holes along the way, though they're not lore breaking. Final overview This is a very complete adventure experience in anime, and depending on how much free time you got in your hands it could be a treat or a pass, it could fill those feelings you were looking to satisfy or could overwhelm you as the pacing is not how you would've better liked it. Nonetheless is a great work that's just held up by Toei's treatment in later seasons, and its lenght for certain kind of audience.

"One Piece is a modern Odyssey. The overall story is amazing, servicing every level of interest—from a casual experience to those seeking deep, emotionally complex writing. Don't get me wrong—you’re getting a fun pirate adventure about the main character’s journey to becoming King of the Pirates. But every single accomplishment feels well-earned and addicting. At first, I was sure I would drop the series once I felt the sheer weight of the episode count, but now, I feel like there isn’t enough! I'm caught up to the manga and may or may not be reading the leaks as soon as they drop. This is a series I would recommend to anyone, regardless of where they are in their anime journey. What I’m about to say, however, might sound contradictory. You know it, I know it—this show has a pacing issue. I’ve personally watched it three times up to its current episode, so I can speak from experience. On my first watch-through, I followed a filler guide (https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece). On my second watch, I introduced the series to a friend and used a mix of the famous fan project One Pace, which edits the anime to be as close to the manga as possible. Is it perfect? No. But by the end of the journey, we had almost exclusively been using One Pace. Now, on my third watch-through, I'm watching with another friend and using One Pace from the start. This has been the most streamlined experience, and I highly recommend it. I suggest using One Pace all the way up to ""Roof Piece"" in Wano, then proceeding as you please. Personally, I’ve found Egghead’s pacing in the main series to be fine. All that said—if any other series had these pacing issues, it would be absolutely unbearable. But One Piece is just different. It’s worth the patience. It completely changed my perspective on watching anime. There was definitely a phase in my anime-watching journey where I would pick up series just to say I watched them, like adding notches on a belt. Now, I want to go back and rewatch as many series as possible just to enjoy them. Have I been glazing this show? Absolutely. I get it—the sheer popularity might turn people away, and the episode count will almost certainly intimidate some. But it’s worth it. TL;DR: Give the series a shot. Ignore the 1,100+ episodes—just start from episode 1 and watch up to 45. If you’re not hooked by then, One Piece probably isn’t for you, and that’s completely fine.",10,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_39ef072a54,26
"""To true friendship, how long you've known each other means nothing."" - Bon Clay. This phrase was said during an episode of one piece, and never have I seen a show stick true to its messages as this one. One piece is a manga based adventure tv-show, which has been running since 1999, and has established itself as the third highest selling comic book series, and one of the most popular anime to date. It is written by Eiichiro Oda and has been directed by multiple people. This show is set in a world far different from ours, where the strongest man alive, the pirate king Gol D. Roger, passed away but challenged the world to find his hidden treasure, the one piece. The story follows the journey of one of the people seeking this treasure, a teenager named Luffy, and his crew consisting of Zoro, Nami, Ussop, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook and Jinbei. We follow Luffy and his crew as they venture out to the unknown sea called the grand line. But this show isn’t about the hidden treasure, but instead the journey that lead to its discovery. That is what makes this show simply outstanding. Furthermore, this show has some of the best world building seen on TV, if not the best. Since the show is held in a separate world than ours, and with over 900 episodes, the viewer begins to truly understand the aspects of their universe. They understand its dangerous and threats as well as the mysteries yet to be discovered. For instance, from the begging of the show we are introduced to an era in the history of their world where nobody knows what occurred. It was if the events were completely erased from existence. But slowly as the show progresses more of this hidden mystery is revealed. In addition, despite this series being animated, the shots used for each scene make the show’s events feel believable. The directors stays true to the knowledge of modern film techniques and implements them into the series. This series is also beautifully animated and has a large variety of music. They animators are somehow able to create each island and terrain with its own unique touch, allowing for some beautiful animation and scenery. This is followed by some amazing background music fitting of each theme. For these reason I fell in love with the TV-show one piece. Its general amazing plot, fleshed out characters and beautiful shots have made me appreciate it as one of the best TV-shows still running. Despite this show’s great length it is definitely worth every single minute of your time, especially with the show coming to an end in the following few seasons.",10,Recommended,"May 28, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9753e2d383,26
"No Spoilers! One piece is a great anime that has been running since 1999. Now someone new trying to get into one piece might get confused by the varying reviews ranging from really good to bad. The thing is they are all correct. One piece is indeed incredible but at times it can be incredibly slow and some arcs are just plain boring, for me it was the god Enel arc, which is an unpopular opinion. At first the filler arcs were actually good and enjoyable but now I just tend to skip them. The start of the show can seem a little boring as each character's background is established. Now if you can endure the start it actually pays off as even some of the minor details are referred to further in the story which makes it worth it. Overall I would recommend watching it. tldr; One piece can be a bit slow and boring at times but is definitely worth it.",8,Recommended,"Jan 14, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_db0d23e341,26
"“Power isn't determined by your size, but the size of your heart and dreams!” ...[Monkey D. Luffy] In my opinion , One Piece is an incredibly popular anime, known for its unique blend of action, adventure, and comedy. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man with the power to stretch like rubber, as he sets out to become the king of the pirates and find the legendary treasure known as One Piece. One Piece has a vibrant and colorful animation style, which is beautifully rendered and full of energy. The characters are all distinct and memorable, with unique designs and personalities. The action scenes are fast-paced and intense, with a great sense of impact and weight. The comedy is also well-done, with many funny moments and gags that are sure to make you laugh. The story of One Piece is vast and epic, with a huge cast of characters and a complex and intertwining plot. The world of One Piece is full of intrigue and mystery, with many different factions and groups vying for power and influence. The characters are all well-developed and likable, with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the relationships between them are complex and engaging. One Piece also has an excellent soundtrack, with a wide variety of music that fits the mood and tone of the series perfectly. The voice acting is top-notch, with each character having a unique and distinct voice that helps to bring them to life. The overall mood of One Piece is energetic and exciting, with a sense of adventure and excitement that is sure to keep you engaged and entertained. In my opinion, the best arc of One Piece is the Dressrosa arc, which is full of twists and turns, and introduces many interesting new characters and concepts. The arc focuses on the battle for Dressrosa, a kingdom ruled by a corrupt and tyrannical king, and the Straw Hat pirates' efforts to help the people of Dressrosa overthrow their oppressor. The arc features some of the best action and drama of the series, and is a must-see for any One Piece fan.",10,Recommended,"Dec 12, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_38dbc6e912,26
"A 10? NO WAY. but, its the best a long-running shounen has to offer. Let me start: I am a huge One Piece fan, and I have admittedly not watched much non-mainstream animes. Story-9 Art-7 Sound-9 Character-5 Enjoyment-6 Overall-8 Overall: 8 Imagine a great story you could never get tired of. This was Dragon Ball Z before it started blowing universes. One Piece, on the other hand is still able to maintain the depth characters possess, and advance the story even as the world grows bigger in the eyes of the audience. The characters lack development. The anime focuses on the characters' originality rather than development. The world is very big and a lot of people have a lot of different issues. What if there was an anime with a great story that you wish you could savor forever? Well, its One Piece. It doesn't end and is still going strong- what more could you ask for? The story: 9/10. I like when things have a history- so lore never bores me. One Piece offers great adventure and action based story. The world-building is simply phenomenal- power systems, pirates, parts of the world, types of power- using people, marines revolutionaries, control of the government, prison system, secret services.... everything is present and does not seem forced. Popular shounen animes suffer from a forced world-building failing to establish a sensible system, One Piece does not. The world is detailed, sensible and dos not feel forced. The art:7 Its good and I don't see why people hate it so bad. Could be possible I just got used to it, but I have zero problems with it. It wasn't exactly great at the beginning episodes, but considering the sheer volume of the episodes and its age (1999), its not worth complaining. The sound: 9 Voice actors could not have been better. Music is on point. Bink's Sake is a masterpiece. Soundtracks are unforgettable, simply wonderful. Openings are well, openings. They were great at first, then got average and occasionally some great openings do come up. The Characters: 5 Except for Zoro, everyone else is pretty much one-sided. Negligible character development. I would have given even a lower score, but that would be unfair. Nobody in the crew is there for no reason. Everybody has a dream somehow requiring them a voyage across the world. Their past gives them a great depth. Majority side-female characters look like Nami, but with a different hair style/color. Luffy is an average baka character that sometimes gets angry. Sanji is a cliche pervert. Zoro has got a dedicated-for-revenge personality, but isn't. Nami is typical damsel-in-distress, that sometimes is badass. Other animes cannot focus on more than maybe four charachters, One Piece has done so. Villians get beat up more because of the antagonists' willpower rather than tactics. The fights capture emotion, and are plot- driven. While characters have depth, they lack development. Enjoyment: 6 ITS SO GODDAMN SLOW. Pacing is downright horrible. For the love of god, stop talking in middle of fights(talking about post-timeskip ones). Used to be better, but now as the Toei Animation streches a single panel of the manga into a 5- minute long animation, pacing becomes tragic. It was fine pre-timeskip, but now people stay clashing midair for a fucking minute without zero ability yo do so. There are comments on every punch hit, every major move made. Three- panel clashes in the manga is translated into half of the 24 min episode. Other than the fights, everything else is watchable. Used to be entertaining, but now its so slow, its painful. Binge watching is the only way you can enjoy it.",8,Recommended,"Jul 20, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fac7e96e98,26

"Really long review with some spoilers. I will devide my review in Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment *Story* The story started really interesting. A boy who wants to search for the great treasure One Piece and searching for Nakamas for his pirate group. One Piece is devided in arcs. So each arc has a own story that leads to another arc. The problem was not the goal.... It was how long the anime/manga is being going on. Since 20 years+ . I see a lot of parts of the story repeated in every arc. Sometimes it gets boring when for example someone gets in a jail or the same jokes were made. But the story has good aspects too. I love the deveplopment of the hidden mysteries in One Piece. Thats what takes me deep inside. Or the sad parts in flashbacks... Sometimes my tears wont stop. Thats why I love that show for. *Art* The art is really inconsistent. Thats because the anime is going on for 20 years. Digital animation become a thing and changed the art from the 90s and 00s. There were minor changes throughout the series so far: First after Skypia arc, then while Sabaody second part happened and after WCI arc in Wano Arc. The art that changed during Sabaody II was the worst. The art felt really shiny and the characters looked a lot of times off model. Sometimes we got slower action moments due to the pacing issues. ANd sometimes we see no animated scenes. In WCI arc though it got better with better time schedeules. The other change was in Wano arc inspired from the Broly movie. They changed the whole upper staff from One Piece with 3 series directors. The art has no shining colors and looks more modern. Also we get better animated fights, better angles and some more. The art looks more consistent too. The only problem is how directors of the episode handle One Piece episodes. Some are really bad that leads to stiff characters... *Sound* One Piece has one of the best soundtracks in the whole anime industry. The only thing I dont like are the sound effects from Dragon Ball that are used in fights. Sometimes same soundtracks are spammed in every episode... *character* That aspect is really a problem. I liked how Oda (The creator of One Piece) focussed a lot to the characters before the timeskip. After the timeskip he focussed more on side characters in the arcs to develop their characters. I will focus on the main characters Luffy: Luffy is the main protagonist in the whole series. He has the ambition of being the King of the Pirates. Till the one life changing thing around the timeskip he got no character deveplopment. After that one thing that occured the character of Luffy never changed. After that moment he wanted to become stronger. He has a humourous character and tries to be funny. The thing that I hate of him is that he is still childish in his mind and not listening to important things. But I love his strong determination Zoro: The badass in One Piece. No one gets better fight scenes than him. The fangirls would love his abs. He is my favourite character in whole One Piece. His ambition to be the best swordsman in the whole world is really interesting to follow through. But after Timeskip he barely got any good sword fights. Mostly he cuts the opponement with really easy sword slashes. Chopper Really nice backstory and nice touching moments when he cares for his nakama. But also he is the most disappointed character in whole One Piece. He could have been a lot stronger after timeskip... Nami The most annoying character of One Piece but also the most sexy woman who is favoured by Sanji. But the jokes become really really boring when she hits someone if someone ask for panties or being pervert. In the anime she is being sexualized and I dont like it every time. Sanji I love this man but also I have mixed feelings. I really feel sorry for Sanji that he cant get ladies. He is a nice man but gets hit or unlucky. Oda should give that man something. Robin I dont like her character. She had one of the best moments in One Piece in Enies Lobby and after that her character has been ruined. She feels more like a robot or Amazon Alexa when you ask her something. Thats really sad and a waste of oppurtunities. Brook He is a pervert skelton but after the arc where he got introduced Oda focussed less to him. In WCI he got more attention and I want to thank Oda for it. His pervert Jokes are not funny anymore though. Every time asking women for panties gets really annoying. *Enjoyment* Thats what every One piece fan says: The pacing is really bad. I agree its bad. Sometimes I ask myself why it is how it is. But I try to bypass that fact and try to enjoy. Sometimes I really enjoy the episodes and sometimes not. The thing is that 5 Minutes are being gone due to the Opening and retelling. Sometimes you get good paced episodes where no much stalling happens and sometimes really much. Its like a classical western cowboy film where you wait who takes the gun first but stalling with 4-8 Minutes. The cliffhangers sometimes make you less looked forward to the next episode. I dont know if I should drop the series for 3 months to binge watch it, but I cant do it cause Im interested how the story goes on... Overall a 7/10 from me for the recommendation",7,Recommended,"Oct 6, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a2a099d7f4,26
"Easily the best anime I have ever watched and I have watched 14 different action-shounen anime. At the beginning it seems bland and pretty meh but as the episodes go on the story expands and so does the world of one piece as well as the animation and you realize how much of a genius the writer is. Be patient with this anime, It's like an rpg, Bad at the start but once you progress it gets more and more enjoyable to the point you become obsessed. Also make sure you watch the SUB and not the DUB because the voice acting for the DUB is horrible and they also water down the story depending where you watch it. There is a main character but all the other characters in this anime also have a role of importance and strength even many of the antagonists aren't just one-arc characters. The writer will plant a seed early on in the start and reveal the tree 300 episodes later and there is many examples of this. Everything is meticulously planned and everything ends up falling together, I am up to date now at episode 924 and there is still so much of the plot shrouded in mystery and so many questions left to be answered which the writer also plants in your head. Absolute genius of a story! For an anime to be rated 8.5 on MAL when it started airing in 1999 speaks volume that the story is so extravagant that it is akin to fine wine that gets better with age. There is one or two arcs you might find a bit boring but hustle through because there's always a bigger picture at play in this anime.",10,Recommended,"May 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_070917a64c,26
"No single review could ever amount to the magnitude of mixed feelings i've felt watching this anime over the last 12 years, but it's a risk worth making should i only succeed in making this single point crystal clear. Story: 10/10 I often ask myself ""What makes a good story?"", but quite interchangeably I now ask ""What makes One Piece's so good?"" - what separates it from everything else, and why would anyone in 2017 commit to the behemoth of episodes? Well ... for the most part I don't think many people 'can' watch it. It's my belief that had you joined the roller coaster 18 years ago, it would be much easier to love because this anime certainly hasn't aged well for those without the highest form of patience and it's excruciatingly slow-paced. Yet, returning to my former question what separates it's story is the 'Flow' - and it my belief this is what has made it a masterpiece (Filler & Specials excluded). Sadly, we're seeing less and less emphasis on this basic storytelling technique, as sophisticated plot and characters take the center stage. I've yet to see a new successful action anime without apocalyptic stakes and drama we've all seen many times. The brilliance of One Piece is that the stakes and drama unfolds onto the characters themselves and their friends but never onto the World. As a result the plot is naturally driven by the characters as they frequently react to their needs, wants, loves and desires. New land's call to them, but they have a choice and some of this anime's drama in the beginning revolves around Captain Luffy's leadership but as the anime progresses a group-friendship born from love, tragedy, desperation and forgiveness rises, and with their loyalties - so, too does their Standing (Power) to the World. Characters: 9/10 The Captain and First Mate of all Pirate Crews are hierarchical of strength, however to Luffy's Strawhat Pirates the title is mainly a formality, however for the sake of time, i will argue the strongest of the group are reflective of the rest and it's also worth noting that exclusive 'best friends' don't really exist among the Strawhats as their friendship is mutual across the crew. The unique bonds between characters may at times be confused as a character's preference to one another but when boiled down, they treat everyone the same. Monkey D. Luffy To the onlooker, I could understand how Luffy appears as cheesy 'Comical Relief' character and to an extent this is true. In the face of danger that would otherwise strike fear or anger into his peers, he will be remembered by me as the most light-hearted anime character of all time, but also the most wrathful. I see many similarities between Luffy and Goku (DBZ) only Luffy's living in harsh world, forcing a more human/realistic character. For instance in his mistakes and weakness, he'll weep and apologize. There's no coming back from the afterlife, and death leaves it's scars on him . His passion and dream for discovering the One Piece treasure far exceed anyone else in the World, however he wouldn't hesitate to throw it all away if it meant saving a friend. The very little ego he bears is seen in the rare times he must stop being a friend and act like a Captain for the sake of others and his dream. Roronoa Zoro Best defined as the untameable beast with swords, who is indifferent from all his comical friends in his seriousness. I'd once wondered ""Why three swords?"" but this oddity is quickly pardoned by the mastery of his techniques. Ironically he's pretty normal in the world of One Piece and Devil Fruit powers. Again, to ignite perspectives i'd draw as many similarities to differences between Vegeta (DBZ). Pride, separates him from sharing moments with the Crew, and the case is strong for Zoro being more powerful than Luffy, and for what begins as a ""I help you, you help me"" deal between Zoro and Luffy quite slowly turns into a friendship defined by Zoro's actions and never his stubborn words. Character progression is strongest with Zoro Sound: 3/5 (Excluding Openings and Endings) Music throughout does perfectly drive excitement, however these instances come far too rarely and could probably be counted on one hand. It's my belief that those who believe Sound and Art really define good anime are the very cause and death to Creativity in anime, and i can quite easily look past One Piece's under-performing music - though one would do well to note that my standard for 5/5 is one track's 'timelessness' and transgression from anime to communities worldwide (try Shirō Sagisu's - Never Meant to Belong) Art: 3/5 (Subject to the scrutiny of 2017) - Old art = 2/5 + New art 4/5 Truly original artistry, however i believe the Story deserves the credit after all it's the catalyst for the artistic flexibility that's hardly ever allowed by typical plots. Overall: 25/30 ~ 83/100 ~ B Performance To conclude, the anime isn't perfect. Many deter from it, or Drop the series by virtue of it's art and slow pacing which are fair considerations to have especially when subscribing to an anime debated to be only 50% to 80% completed at 700+ episodes. My advice would be against the average viewer attempting it. Many of today's action series run fast towards the cataclysmic conclusion. Only once you get bored of the same recycled plots and character template should you consider the voyage of One Piece. Everybody searches for an anime that will leave them wanting more, but with One Piece you don't have to wait, but you still need patience :D Sincerely, Willowboy. “Join my wander, to a yonder.

Some might be intimidated by the episode count, but it's a chill anime, it's something you can watch when you're a bit braindead and don't want to pay that much attention, so the episodes go by quickly. But when it has its moments oh my god it has its moments. I won't spoil anything, just give it a go. The way I remember everything about the earlier arcs, and how it's tied into the story, means to me that it must be a great show. As a final word, learn how to use the 'skip 5 seconds' key well then you will have a splendid time with this anime :) every time they show one face they're probably gonna show 5 other faces which you can gladly skip. The show makes sure to set the tone when dialogue becomes important, so you will most likely not be missing out. After episode 500 I spend an average of 10-12 minutes per episode, depending on if it's essential to the plot it might be more.

"I have been converted into a One Piece fan... there I said it. But that would make for a poor and short review so, let me start off by saying, I hated one piece for many years. I cannot stress enough how much I disliked it. This wasn't for the usual reasons either like the unusual Art style or the english dub (I haven't heard that since it first aired on toonami when I was a kid). I blame it mainly on the anime just being flat out boring for the first 200 episodes. even the Alabasta arc, which was the first major arc of the series was sub-par at best. I was committed to watching this show though in order to find out what all the fuss was about so I must have re-watched up to the sky island arc over 9 or 10 times but still I couldn't figure it out. Eventually I decided to just power through sky island and i didn't regret it. I discovered that the greatness that is one piece begins at the ""Water 7"" arc. it is the first time That you can see the characters really come into their own and not just win through luck or crying really hard. It is at this point that the fights hit that ""Let me find an AMV of that"" kind of level. This is also the point when the artwork goes HD and stops looking like a first grader drawing pirates over a water color. So aesthetically the anime becomes much more enjoyable as well. This is especially true when the crew reaches saobody, the artwork becomes absolutely spectacular and you begin to look forward to what amazing scenes you will see next. the Characters are all relatable and the stories can be really difficult to pull your head away from. I will admit though, sometimes the constant crying from the main cast can be a bit too much and their general stupidity can also be a bit trying at times, but beyond that, if you can push through the first 200 episodes, you wont regret it. i would give it a 10/10 but the first bit makes it really hard.",9,Recommended,"Oct 19, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_07d1e403d5,26

"The story of Monkey D. Luffy's quest to find the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates offers a blend of uniqueness and familiarity. The concept of a treasure hunt is a classic trope, yet the story sets itself apart with its richly detailed world, imaginative settings, and the sheer scope of the adventure. While some plot developments might be predictable due to the genre's conventions, the journey itself is filled with enough surprises, quirky characters, and creative scenarios to keep it engaging. Personally, as a fan of epic adventures and grand quests, I found the predictability to be part of the charm, enhancing the comfort and excitement of the narrative. The characters in this series are well-rounded and diverse, each with their own strengths, flaws, and distinct personalities. Luffy, for example, is incredibly strong and determined, yet his carefree and sometimes naive nature often leads him into trouble. His companions, too, exhibit a range of abilities and characteristics that make them feel real and relatable. They have their own motivations, backstories, and personal growth throughout the series, adding depth to their roles. This balance of attributes ensures that the characters are compelling and believable, making their interactions and development a key highlight of the story. I believe many people will enjoy this series, even if it isn't to everyone's taste. The blend of adventure, humor, and emotional depth, coupled with a unique art style, makes it appealing to a wide audience. Fans of epic quests, character-driven narratives, and imaginative worlds will find much to love here. However, those who prefer more grounded or serious storytelling might find the series' whimsical and fantastical elements less appealing. Overall, the series' strengths lie in its engaging characters, vibrant world, and the sense of adventure that permeates every episode, making it a standout in its genre.",10,Recommended,"May 30, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a795975cd5,27

"This show was a masterpiece up until the underwater island . I definitely encourage you to see it for up to episode 750 i guess (so around 250 hours) of quality anime with incredibly awesome character development and back story. Afterwards the show reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly slow down . each episode now contain the minimum ""content"" you can put into an episode. However if you can read the manga unlike me , you will have all the fun. The anime Arc system is one of the best , because each island is like an arc (more of a level) . each island got the same idea of progress , which sound boring but is extremely fun . Every here and there he is collecting a crew member some are better than other (as for you the viewer) . Art style back then is kinda shitty because it was made in 1999 now its ... more shitty but in HD . As i said , you will be faced with an awesome anime that will sadly loose its brightness . Mostly if you wanna know why I recommend this it will be because of emotions this anime give you . in each backstory you will cry , in most arcs you will cry . both of sadness and joy",9,Recommended,"Sep 28, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f6b62a67c8,27
"One Piece stands as a monumental testament to the power of storytelling in the realm of anime, captivating audiences worldwide with its boundless imagination, intricate plotlines, and an ensemble of memorable characters. As a devoted fan, it's genuinely exhilarating to delve into the multifaceted world Eiichiro Oda has crafted, and I find myself compelled to share the reasons why this anime has not only endured the test of time but continues to reign supreme in the hearts of its admirers. First and foremost, One Piece's narrative brilliance lies in its intricate world-building. The Grand Line, the Red Line, and the myriad of islands, each with its unique culture and challenges, form a kaleidoscope of diversity that fuels the anime's adventurous spirit. Oda's ability to seamlessly weave together complex political intrigue, profound philosophical undertones, and lighthearted humor is nothing short of genius. Whether it's navigating through the mysteries of the Void Century or confronting the emotional upheavals of the characters, One Piece is an intricate tapestry that unfolds with each passing episode, leaving fans eagerly anticipating the next revelation. The heart of One Piece undoubtedly beats within its characters, a diverse and captivating crew that has etched itself into the annals of anime history. Monkey D. Luffy, with his unyielding determination and infectious enthusiasm, leads the Straw Hat Pirates on a journey that transcends mere piracy. Each crew member, from the enigmatic Roronoa Zoro to the empathetic Tony Tony Chopper, contributes to the synergy that makes the crew a familial unit. Oda masterfully crafts their backstories, creating emotionally resonant arcs that delve into their dreams, fears, and aspirations. Witnessing their growth and the bonds they forge is a testament to the anime's ability to explore the human condition, making it relatable and inspiring to fans of all ages. Beyond the crew, One Piece introduces a myriad of compelling and often morally ambiguous characters, from the Shichibukai to the Yonko, each adding layers of complexity to the overarching narrative. The enigmatic and flamboyant antagonist, Gol D. Roger's former crewmate, and now the Pirate King's successor, Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard), exemplify the series' ability to create formidable and intriguing adversaries. The ongoing clash between the Navy, revolutionaries, and pirates keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, as alliances shift and the balance of power in the world undergoes seismic changes. The animation and art style of One Piece have evolved over the years, culminating in a visually stunning spectacle that does justice to Oda's rich and dynamic universe. From the picturesque landscapes to the heart-stopping battles, the animation studio has succeeded in bringing the manga to life with flair and fidelity. The meticulously designed characters, inventive Devil Fruit abilities, and the grandeur of the battles are a testament to the dedication and talent of the animators, ensuring that each episode is a visual feast. One Piece, however, isn't merely about the grandiosity of its battles or the intricacies of its plot. At its core, it is an exploration of friendship, resilience, and the pursuit of one's dreams. Themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of freedom permeate the narrative, resonating deeply with viewers on a personal level. The emotional highs and lows, coupled with the humor that seamlessly punctuates the intense moments, create an emotionally engaging experience that transcends the typical shonen formula. In conclusion, One Piece is not just an anime; it's an odyssey that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of animation. With its expansive world, deeply layered characters, and a narrative that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and philosophy, One Piece stands tall as a beacon of excellence in the anime genre. As a fan, I eagerly anticipate each new episode, knowing that Oda's masterpiece is destined to etch itself further into the hearts of both longtime followers and new converts alike. Embark on this grand voyage, and you'll find that the allure of One Piece is as boundless as the sea itself.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fd7a3e2a9e,27
"This show is truly an investment. I get why many people wouldnt want to take the time to catch up on 900+ episodes and counting. It is daunting but the pay off is so worth it in the end. After so long you feel like you become part of the Strawhats. I've watched many an anime but never once felt like I was part of a family like with OP. There is drawbacks. It is most definitely not the prettiest show out there. If you like anime for eye candy this may not be the anime for you and thats alright. I've always been about content over looks when it comes to any entertainment. The charters are phenomenal, the music gives me chills, the commitment was worth it.

"I have seen the great shonen anime. Naruto, roughly 90 episodes and i left by bored. Bleach, however, loved it, but history is not great and strong. HxH, which is one of the best animes I've seen in my life. In One Piece, I cried, I laughed. Many of my favorite characters are anime One Piece (Rayleigh, Shanks) for their ways of thinking and appearances. Luffy's band is fantastic, all the characters you take them affection. What I'm getting at is that many chapters have, that should not throw you back. For many chapters have and although the beginning is very weak, over time, it repays the time spent.",9,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_35b2aee286,27
"One Piece! This anime is definitely aimed more towards kids but in a way that even a 30 year old man will like for sure.Why? you ask. For one because it is filled with happy characters and you get a happy feel to it. Also because it is filled with awesome action and pirates. I will guarantee that even if you think it looks horrible in the beginning(which i did) you will like it after you keep watching. Art-(8) The art is very unique for its time and is not all that good in the beginning considering the time the anime started, but it gets a 100x if not 1000x better after you keep watching. Characters-(9) All the main characters have different personalities and backgrounds and all give a really nice happy up-feel feeling. Story-(10) I rate the story of an anime by how unique it is and the enjoyment of it, and this anime is extremely unique and enjoyable and you will not find another anime with such a good unique idea for the story. This anime is the kind of anime that when you have a bad morning and have a bad day for the rest of the day you will be able to keep going because you will have the feeling of looking forward to at least one thing and that will be going home after everything bad happens to you all day and watching this anime.

"I enjoyed early One Piece, the story had me hooked and I would binge as many episodes as I could in a day. That said recently One Piece has begun to really slow down in their stories. Each episode from the Fishman Arc onwards only really has about 10 minutes of new content and a lot of that is looping animations to pad run time. Once it got to the Big Mom Arc I started to notice the extreme drop in animation quality as well. Because of this slow pacing and excessive drop in quality it is hard for me to even watch a single episode now. Early One Piece for me was a joy, but the post-Fishman Arcs are just so slow and poorly animated it becomes hard to watch after a while.",7,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d725125d05,27
"One Piece is the greatest piece of fiction possibly ever made. Never before has anything enthralled me as much as the straw hat crew and the world that Eiichiro Oda has carefully built. Characters and their backstories are unbelievably well constructed, with emotional and powerful musical tracks to back up all the best moments. From the very beginning, this series is just magical and it always reminds you of this as learn more and come across new mysteries. I caught up when the series was at Episode 613 and have been week to week since then while reading the manga! - Skip filler. (except the G8 Arc) - Use One Pace if you have to, in order to dodge the Toei pacing. - Art / Animation has peaks and valleys but damn, the peaks are amazing. - Don't worry about catching up, Enjoy the journey!",9,Recommended,"Feb 19, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_858fc9789c,27
"""NO SPOILERS"" From the outside, I always thought One Piece just didn't look that great. 900 episodes later and I couldn't have been more wrong XD.. Honestly never saw myself rating this show a 10 o.o The episode count alone used to be one of the things that kept me from watching in the past. Sadly now that I've made it through almost all of them I only wish I had another 900 left to watch. Compared to other long-running animes One Piece has managed to find the sweet spot on how to continue a story without making it feel drug out or boring. They did an amazing job at keeping old characters that you met at the start of the show feel relevant much later into the series. And having so many episodes helped to drive a more natural character progression over the years. I kind of look at this way. Take Naruto and Fairy Tail, trim off all the bad parts and take the remaining good stuff that you may have loved from those shows and that's One Piece. Good exciting fights, high adventure, enjoyable characters, engaging story, sprinkled with justs enough sad bits to balance things out. Oh and very few fillers compared to the number of episodes. The fillers that it does contain are actually watchable and not just pure fluff. So all and all if you're at a loss for what to watch and need a show that will continue to be great for the years to come I'd say give this one a shot.",10,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e42d8266db,27

I was keeping from this anime as much as I could and since my friends who was in these OP theme always insisted on watching this, i always said NO THANKS NO NO GO AWAY BYE. And here we go in August when I started watching these.. the first mby 20 episodes I was vomiting, I could not even get the point of it, but my friend said CONTINUE, ONE mORE EPISODE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE!!!

And now it's November, 2 and I finished the episode 811. It was 2,5 month of full joy and love, I now understand why OP is in absolute TOP in Japan.. this is a story of smth you will never see in other anime.. this is a soul, a heart, the feelings and this is a deep breath of fresh air. I still wonder how anime that airs 20 years (!!!) IS STILL SO POP AND ORIGINAL, how it hasnt lost its potential, how abroad the imagination of the mangaka. I hope it wil air more and more and more.

"A great anime that you have to see! When it comes to long-term anime is a piece for me by far at the top. That Oda has created this is simply the madness. Although it is the shortest in comparison to many short anime series, it has an incredible value for the enormous size.. Countless characters with intense backgrounds. Over the years, a gigantic universe has built up. In doing so, everything is handmade, and only the coherent and self-sufficient picture. Only the Filler sequences are also exaggerated. The same gilded for the often senseless stretching of the anime. But these are almost the only criticisms I have here.",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_76bf37d5f6,27
"edit: After years of putting the manga off, I restarted One Piece from around where I stopped, at Zou Island. I don't know what's the fuss about One Piece getting rid of all the filler, the animation is still repetitive, pace is slow and at worst cuts off from storybeat to storybeat. But by the gods, the hype. It hits in a special way when you've watched or read the series on/off since Alabasta. I never hated OP, just the path it took during Fishman Island and especially Punkhazard. It has remained close to my heart nonetheless. I've laughed and cried with it for years. I've grown with it, lumped my understanding on it many times to see layers upon layers of fine tuned entertainment. I adore One Piece for what it is. But as for recommendation, I sincerely suggest you take on this journey today. If there is one anime that never ceases to give, it is One Piece. People have their optimized ways of enjoying it, some only manga, some say you watch the high points of the story in anime... Please. Watch the anime. At least until the legendary time skip. Find the custom subs to enhance the experience. All we got in weekly stuff is plain text, but by all that is holy, the custom subs are a beautiful addition to what is already a masterpiece. This is all from my personal experience, and it probably won't be same to you. All I'm trying to say is please join this crew of millions. This decades old journey. One day it will end. To see the sails burst wide one last time... I want all of you to be there with me. Let us set sail together, to the endless dream. (original below) Don't hate it, but dropped it around Fishman Island due to decrease in production quality. Continued after that in manga only. This is my choice of the old ""big four"" and the only one that is still ongoing (apart from the restarted DB). I highly suggest One Piece even as an anime even though it has horrible amounts and many kinds of filler stuck with it. Some moments of the story are delivered with just that much punch that it's worth it. The animation quality decreases drastically after the time skip, so be wary. The time skip also kinda splits the story in two halves. Join me, millions of others and Luffy as he gathers his crew, captures everyone's hearts and seeks out to be the one true king of the seas.

"One piece is masterclass. The art grows on you, the characters are irreplaceable, and the soundtrack and intros fit One Piece's story so well that it's hard to find another like it. My personal favourite anime(s) stem from each genre and follow no real path. I like anime like AOT, Eureka Seven, Blood+, and Code Geass. That said, one piece's genre was something I was never really into. I've always been into more of a psychological/drama/action type person, so it is interesting to say that one piece is one of my favourite anime's of all time. I'd only recommend this anime to people who ONLY care about enjoyment of an anime. Don't watch one piece if all you care about is a certain genre (ie action, fighting(martial arts), etc) or even an overly complex plot. It's an adventure anime at heart that brings you along the journey as a way of narrating the plot. So, for those who like wholesome funny anime with good fighting scenes and an amazingly well thought out adventure plot, this is the anime for you. If you're looking for a good amount of gore, any bit of romance, or even strict fighting everywhere in the anime then this isn't for you. Who knows though, just like me you might still somehow enjoying it more than any other anime you have seen.

"When I first embarked on the journey of One Piece I honestly did not know what to expect. After catching up with Naruto and found myself perusing different anime trying to find something similar to Naruto. After watching a few rather short series, I was intrigued by One Piece but quickly became dissuaded as the episode count was around 400+ at this point. Well I decided to wait till I had free time to watch it. Fast forward a couple of months. It's the summer break, I'm bored at home one day and decide to give One Piece a go. I'll admit that while the first couple of episodes were enjoyable, I could tell that I was not truly hooked on the series. The art style was rather strange, a lot of characters had disproportionately large feet compared to their bodies. The animation in the beginning is also not that great as this is an old series(however both the art style and animation improve over time). The episode that threw all doubt about this series was the Baratie Arc. In the early East Blue saga, Baratie is my favorite arc for a numerous amount of reasons. The themes touched upon during that arc spoke of the power of will, ambition, and dreams. This is was the moment I knew I was in it for the long haul. One Piece is still continuing with the end still quite a distance away. This anime while containing basic shounen elements, such as a not too bright protagonist with a goal and having friendship be a key aspect, is able to contain a lovable quirky main cast, most of which are not one dimensional characters, a vast and unique world which is brimming with adventure, and a milieu of interesting characters and plots contained within it. My favorite aspect of One Piece is the adventure and exploration, the mangaka Eiichiro Oda was definitely successful in creating an interesting and vibrant world, and the anime for the most part conveys it well. The animation quality is the biggest complaint I have with this anime. For a majority of the series the animation quality is actually pretty good,it started off poor but steadily improved. After the Skypiea arc the improvement is significant. The quality lasts like this until the Marineford Arc, after which it devolves. Currently, due to almost catching up with the manga in terms of content, coupled with the poor animation quality by Toei has made the One Piece anime drop in quality, which is a shame because One Piece has a sacred spot in my top 5 manga.",7,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_400ca86e52,28
"Before I begin my review, I would like to tell you that I will be completely honest about what I like about One Piece and what I don't. I'm not a fanboy, and I've been a HUGE fan of Naruto/Naruto Shippuden for over 8 years prior to starting One Piece. Few other long running anime I've watched and loved, Hunter X Hunter, Gintama, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball Z. (I've watched/read all of Fairy Tail, loved it then started hating it, just like many others). I say this so that when I say One Piece is my absolute favorite among shonen anime, you will understand how much I actually love One Piece. I started One Piece a little over a year ago and it has quickly become my favorite. I have never regretted starting One Piece..except for the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with it now. Lol. P.S: Ignore any typos. And grab some snacks because it's a very long review. My review will be quite long (too many good things about One Piece) but I will include a shorter/summary version at the bottom if you don't have time. But I suggest you go through it all :) Let me start with the negatives, which is only one and is only concerned with the Anime. Negatives: The Anime has terrible/painful pacing, especially during the Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Punk Hazard, Dressrosa arcs. This however, is exlusive to the Anime version and can be overcome by skipping through episodes, skipping fillers (if you wish), etc. So it's not too much of a concern. You'll just have the trouble of waiting for at least a week just to get an episode that cover one or less than one chapter (which is quite less). Now coming to the pros. There are a LOT of amazing things about One Piece. Plot (10/10): The plot of One Piece is the single largest plot of any popular anime that has come out thus far. I say this with confidence as other long running series like Detective Conan, Hajime no Ippo (which are very good themselves) have a narrower plot. One Piece has phenomenal world building. Without spoiling too much, it occurs in it's own UNIVERSE and time. In terms of the vastness of the setting, only Dragon Ball Z comes close. There's several hundreds of different/unique powers. Most of these powers (including that of the protagonist) are completely fresh/never before seen anywhere, not just in anime. (And no, it's not just Devil Fruits) The plot intensifies exponentially and increases in complexity as it progresses. The first 100 episodes, it's just the pirate Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist, and a his first few crew mates sailing to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that has been left at the last island of a harsh, destructive Ocean called the Grand Line. But soon we realize a lot more. In the next 100 episodes we learn more about the ACTUAL plot. By the 200s, we have a very well established plot line, but it still grows. In the following 100-200 episodes we learn much more..and so on. By the first 400 or so episodes, the setup is done and everything that follows is just pure awsomeness. With every passing arc, the story gets better and better. However, there is on not-so-important arc which is mostly for comedy which I personally loved (like almost every other One Piece fan, so you probably will too) People often complain about how long One Piece is, but let me tell you this, that's how big and vast the plot is. It REQUIRES time. You will have to be patient. Everything that happens in One Piece happens for a good reason, but it does take time. So be patient and try to watch as many episodes as possible. You can binge watch it and finish it in 3-months (Like I did) (as of 28th March, 2016) or watch it slowly over the course of a year. The plot is always, ALWAYS filled with mysteries. Some answered soon, some so EPIC that we can only learn of them when the series reaches it's end. This is one of the things that keeps me going. It always has comedy. Many many epic moments and even more to come (it'll be obvious once you catch up to either the Anime or the Manga). Honestly, I've been a One Piece fan for very little over a year now but I don't see myself disliking it ever. I have more than enough confidence in Eiichiro Oda's story writing that was built through 734 episodes and 820 chapter (and still counting). I was never disappointed with any aspect of the plot of One Piece (Except maybe one, but that's completely insignificant). One Piece has many great/amazing/epic fights. However, let me warn you, there's many mediocre/decent to good fights as well. I would recommend Dragon Ball Z, Hunter x Hunter, or Naruto for fights. The fights in One Piece are are not as good as in these but are still very good and enjoyable so no worries here. Even if everything else (art, sound, fights) were terrible, (which obviously is not the case. It's the exact opposite) the plot alone is worth a 10/10 overall. Trust me. There's a 90%+ chance that you will feel the same. If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into this. Also, contradictory to what some might say, One Piece is not repetitive. There is always a reason for why something happens and its almost always different. So be prepared for an exciting, adventurous, enjoyable, funny, action packed, suspenseful story...I mean epic. That's right, One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. ------------------ Characters (10/10): One Piece is filled with several amazing characters whom you will love and several others whom you will hate (amazing evil-minded, hateful villains). Shanks, an amazing character introduced early on, has in fact inspired the creation of a very popular character in another series! Gildarts from Fairy Tail. There's a vast variety of personalities you will find in One Piece. and many important characters have great character development. Both the antagonists and the protagonists have great moments and undergo proper development. --------------------- Animation (7/10): The animation of One Piece is not good. However, epic moments, epic fight scenes, etc. are almost always very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie level animation! If you don't believe it, watch it! (Full of spoilers though, obviously) The animation is great when required. Other times, it's quite still and stocky. But this shouldn't be much of a concern either as the important parts are seldom badly animated. The series goes HD somewhere near the early 200s because it started in 1997 so don't judge it too soon :P You can look up Naotoshi Shida scenes in One Piece. He is a very famous animator and has created several beautifully animated scenes for One Piece. ----------------------- Art (9/10): You must've heard, One Piece has a very unique art style. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD The backgrounds are always amazing and full of detail. There are thousands gorgeous shots/panels. --------------------- Sound (9/10): The One Piece soundtrack is also one of my favorites. The background scores fit the situations perfectly. Suspense building, action, adventurous, uplifting, you name it. There's tracks for all this. It's heavily orchestral. I often find myself listening to the soundtracks as they are quite epic. ---------------------- So yeah, that's it. Overall, One Piece is superb, excellent, amazing, awesome, etc. Few downs here and there but those are very insignificant in comparison. --------------------- SHORT VERSION The plot of One Piece is absolutely amazing. It grows in complexity as it progresses and is always filled with intriguing mysteries. The main plot line is more than just finding treasure and becoming the Pirate King. It's unbelievably huge. One Piece has a vast setting and amazing world building with epic, unique powers that were never heard of before. There's always comedy, adventure, action, mystery, and fun in One Piece. Due to it's vastness and complexity, One Piece is very very long. However, ignoring the bad pacing of the Anime (only) it is never boring. If you feel like an episode is being dragged, forward it, or skip through a few stretched parts (Like 30 seconds of smoke, 5 minute stare-downs, 6 minutes of recap, etc.) The slow pacing can be easily overcome. Everything in One Piece happens for a reason, and it is seldom repetitive (contradictory to what a few others say). Has many great fights that are often very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie-level animation. But fights aren't it's strong point (though they are epic). If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into deaths. Amazing variety in characters. There are characters whom you will absolutely love, and others, like villains, whom you will hate (in the good way. Evil villain = more hate). And there's villains who are badass as well. Many intriguing personalities and backstories. Great character development Art style is unique and character designs are almost always amazing. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD Has very good soundtracks that capture the moment perfectly. One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. ----------------------------------- One Piece has quickly grown to be my favorite shonen anime. I hope you enjoy One Piece and one day we could probably spend hours and hours just talking about it. Patience is key when watching One Piece. But you will most probably get hooked to it pretty soon.

"One Piece is as close as you can get to a perfect series. It puts Oda's hardwork from these past 20 years of putting his body through hell to produce the best of content for his fan's enjoyment. Character work, Backstories, Drama, Adventure, Mysteries, Over The Top Goals, World Building, you ask and Oda does it better than anyone. But Oda's work doesn't gets as much recognition from the newer generation to which 800+ episodes is a daunting task, which is true to say the least. Although getting into One Piece is hard to said the least i mean the number of episodes crushed my urge to watch the anime a couple of times until finally i decided to watch it. One Piece is all about pirates travelling through the vast seas looking for the great treasure named ""One Piece."" The one who will find the treasure will earn himself the title ""Pirate King"" something which every pirate on the seas wants to become. The former Pirate King, Gold Roger ushered the world into a great pirate era. ""You want my treasure? You can have it! Search for it! I left everything i gathered together at that place!"" - Gold D Roger's dying words that drove countless people to become pirates in search of his treasure, One Piece. The Main Character named Monkey D Luffy idealizes Gold Roger and dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the One Piece. He is so obsessed with his dream, that his catchphrase is actually ""I am Luffy and i will be the king of pirates"" and he doesn't lets a single opportunity slide to let everyone knows about it. He later recruit his loyal crew as they travel through the harsh seas of the ""Grand Line"" while solving mysteries and defeating strong enemies in search of the One Piece and fulfill their individual dreams. If you want to start watching the anime i recommend you to watch the movie special : ""The Episode Of East Blue"" -The Special Covers The First 44 Episodes of the anime The First 44 Episodes focus on the Main Character Luffy looking for members for his pirate crew. These episodes feature character arcs for the members he will recruit across 5 arcs. The arcs focus on their Character, Backstory and their motives so the audience can connect better with the characters. With this you could easily be hooked into watching the anime as was i If you find yourself interested in One Piece after watching the special and want to continue then continue on watching the next episode which is episode 45 and forward. However i have to say there are a lot of filler arc in one piece therefore the wiki is your best friend. All filler arcs are non cannon and just a waste of time in my opinion since it bring no plot driven trivia and just gives small jokes and in all honesty just by filler we can eliminate a few tens of episodes. And with that you should watch One Piece. Because if you don't you're missing out on a one of a kind show that make you experience all kinds of emotions.",10,Recommended,"Oct 8, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ed77219495,28

"One piece is the best anime i am watched ever , i am so love the story , characters and the special world of One piece , each characters has its own unique story, arcs in one piece so interesting that they contribute to understanding the characters. The favorite arc is marineford becouse this war has have everythings an anime needs. My favorite characters is edward newgate (whitebeard) ; newgate is the ferfect characters in one piece , he is ferfect battle machine for any war, my opinion is newgate is strongest characters in one piece, then Roger, Garp, Xebec and any other characters, Roger not strongest characters but he just pirate king and , newgate said in one piece he not want to become pirate king but he wanted to have a family. I wait to the end of one piece and i hope the end is as exciting and happy as i expect. I want to thanks the creator of this ingenious series and every who worked on the series.",10,Recommended,"Jul 3, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d80caa725d,28
"One Piece it's one of the longest running titles of all time, when I started to watch it, I was really impressed by the huge ammount of episodes and chapters, but I have to say that most of the experience was really quick. This review will be divided by the first four sagas of the show (East Blue, Arabasta, Skypiea and Water Seven), because if I do the arc by arc thing, it will be just long as the bible. This isn't totally my personal opinion of the series, it's the most objective review that I could do for one of my favourite (not best) shows. EAST BLUE (Episode 1 to 61): The story starts with a kid in a little island, he wants to find a really important and searched treasure, when he grows up a bit he starts the journey, in this saga he will form his crew, and go to the next area, the Grand Line. This saga it's one of my favourites, it has a lot of effort on it, you have a lot of fun moments with the characters and most of them have a significative backdrop and a bombastic personality, also each character of the crew has a labor to do on the journey (study the weather, cook for the crew...) but also all of them have a singular way to fight the enemies. One thing that many people points out as bad in this saga are the visuals, for me the Toei anime adaptation here captures totally the magic and the exageration of the manga, with one of the most unique styles I have ever seen. As I have said, I won't go on many details, I find most of the arcs of this first part from good to great, the best one beign Arlong Park for having each character doing something, a menacing villain and one of the best backstorys on any character that I have seen ever. Maybe it's a bit messy that this saga doesn't have a main villain (maybe Smoker but he cames only at the finale), but I like most of them (Buggy, Gin, Arlong, Kuro...). So this part it's very basic and simple, but has totally EVERYTHING for a great action adventure, it has comedy, drama, creative battles and great world building. Final mark: (8/10) ARABASTA (Episode 62-135): In the previous saga, there wasn't a real plot in general, only plots for individual arcs, but the principal one was just doing a crew for finding a treasure, in this saga this is no longer the thing, the story here starts with an island full of people celebrating the arrive of our heroes, but they are in reality a big corporation controlled by someone called ""Crocodile"", the protagonists have to help a princess of an entire kingdom to stop this corporation that wants to kill the king of Arabasta. So we have now a main objective, a more interesting plot and a main villain. This was for me a really great decision for part of Oda, and I have to say that he didn't only had a great idea, he executed also pretty well. The heroes go on some islands before Arabasta, they fight some kings and people that work in the corporation of Crocodile. This is probably the weakest part of the saga (specially the Chopper arc), beacause even if this arcs weren't bad at all, they were a bit slower that the ones of East Blue saga, but at least they had really brilliant moments, like thhe giants realtionship, Chopper's flashback or some of the main battles. When they arrive to Arabasta they meet Ace, Luffy's brother, they meet with Smoker and Tashigi again, Crocodile it's shown with a ridiculous powerful habilitie and the setting of this desertic island it's just great. The slow pacing works here because there are a lot of things going on at the same time and we need a bit more time than before for understand what is going on. This arc have my favourite battle of them all (Luffy VS Crocodile), and the rest of the side battles are also pretty good and interesting (except Nami's one which was boring sorry). Speaking of the villain, he's just great, Crocodile has a lot of personality, their motives of removing all the water of the desert are justified, it has a lot of pressence and it's always trolling the heroes mentally. The finale it's one of the most satisfying ones that I've seen, it's just really epic and also has the tragedy of Vivi lefting the crew, it was pretty real and not out of place. My main problem it's the plot armor, seriously there's a lot of it in the last 20 episodes, a guy just survived a nuclear explosion, wow that was bullshit. Overall, was a great saga with many problems but with a ton of good stuff too, I personally liked more than the previous one. Final mark: (8/10) SKYPIEA (Episode 136-206) Robin joined and she has no personality or backstory in the whole saga, it's really akward for like 100 episodes and by far the worst companian by now. I can't say many things about this one, I liked the first 15 episodes or so when they go to that island full of unrespectful people and then shows Bellamy as the villain of the arc, I find him funny and also had an interesting philosophy about dreams and goals, also Luffy's punch was epic. My problem with this saga it's, that it kinda has a plot but at the same time doesn't, the heroes are changing their objective constantly and it's even frustrating. So yeah I liked the Jaya arc, my problems are with the main arc, when they go to this sky island where it's God and also a bell that they need to find to prove that a guy that they just met (and was not there anymore) wasn't a liar or something. It's a bit messy and also the pacing here is even slower that the one in Arabasta, and here there isn't that much going on, the people just goes around in a giant jungle and tries to survive, that's it. The villain it's called God Enel and I really liked him because, even it didn't had the intelligence of Crocodile, he has charisma and a power of mass destruction, but his showdown with Luff was disapointing and really dumb actually. I don't know, this saga was really promising with a cool setting and themes like religion and believes, but nothing was executed properly. Final mark: (6/10) WATER SEVEN (Episode 207-325) And this is the part of the review that the fanbase will hate so if you are just a fanboy that thinks that this is the best part, please get out of here. I'm not longer hiding it, this is for me by far the worst saga until now, it's the last that I watched of the anime (now I passed to the manga for better pacing and art). Let's start with... a dumb tournament of 20 episodes long? WTF, we pass from a god of electricity to a silly tournament and then to evil corporations again like in Arabasta. I will skip the foxy arc, it's just not worth-watchable and overall a waste of time, if you want to laugh okey, but I think that this arc was situated terribly. At least at the final of this one, we get to know Robin's dreams a bit more, and there's a really overpoewered guy that... doesn't appear again in this entire saga until the ending just to go again. Then the Water Seven arc starts and I have to say that was pretty interesting and tense for a while, it works as a mystery drama action adventure for like 30 episodes and I really hoped something great out of this. Usopp was lefting the crew, the ship was broken, the enemies looked undefeatable (weaker than Enel I have to agree) and most of the arc is really serious and intriguing, Franky is also introduced and it's way better than Robin, he has charisma and he's really useful to the crew. So everything seems great for now, yeah? Well, then Enies Lobby starts and... it's the worst arc yet, maybe worst than the foxy arc because that was only awful filler, but this was awful real plot. First the pacing is again slower than the previous saga, but they also putted filler in middle of important battles and events for no reason, the animation changed to a more static one most of the time and not even the battles were fun at all. I only remember Nami and Franky ones, the rest had awful powerups and predictable resolutions (maybe Luffy VS Lucci was all right but that's it). Speaking of Lucci, he's... eh? I mean okey he looked cool for a while but he has no personality and only wants to kill people, also he's not even the boss, he's the subordinate of an awful guy with no strenght basically, that's lame! The whole plot also seemed like a rehash of Arlong Park and Arabasta, change Nami for Robin, Baroque Works for CP9 and you have it. In this part of the story it's also revealed that Luffy has a special family and basically from here to now the marines and the revolutionaries will help him not for who he is, by who their progenitors are, what is this Naruto??? I have a lot of problems with the saga, even if I don't consider it bad at all it piss me off that this is the most rated one, like c'mon!! Usopp turns to be a cool hero for a while but naaah he just comes back and status quo duh, he's not my favourite character anymore, I prefer Sanji or Franky now. Final mark (5/10) It's a shame that a show that hooked me in so much, now just became another generic shonen with no much to offer, I'm now reading Thriller Bark and it's fun, I also heared great things about the Marineford saga, so I will still viewing it, but I think that I will drop it in the timeskip thing. Still one of my favourites and the overall mark still possitive so I will hope better things after the mediocrity that Water Seven was.

"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.*copied review*",10,Recommended,"May 9, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33b6ca576d,28
"I rated One Piece a 5 even though I have rewatched this anime 13 times since it had 498 episodes, am I an idiot? maybe, but my personal enjoyment cannot cloud my eyes over what this anime did with the series. the only reason it gets a 5 is because it's a horrible adaptation of the manga which is immaculate. One Piece the anime is a fantastic way for manga readers to relive the experiences of reading One Piece for the first time again but not as the first experience. yes, I know many fans had their start with the anime but some of our NA friends had their start with the 4kids dub which everyone would rate a 0/10 even though it is One Piece. If you're reading this and want to experience One Piece in the way I always advocate it, watch episode 1 to 126, if you love it, read chapter 1 until current chapter as of writing this its at 1022 which I understand may sound overwhelming but one piece is an experience of a lifetime. it is my soul, my heart and my life.

"In the episodes I have seen so far, I have only really encountered two things that keep it from being perfect. The first being the art - it is far from being the best art I have seen in anime. However, for me this is easy to look past as the story and music is amazing. The other qualm that I have is the slow pacing. Because of this, I have not been able to continually watch the series. I watch an arc or two, then I put One Piece on hold. I watch other shorter anime until all the One Piece discussion and videos popping up on my Youtube feed rekindles my excitement to watch One Piece. Whenever I come back, I do not regret it.Each arc is thoroughly enjoyable with its character development and unique plot. The filler arcs in One Piece are some of the best if not the best filler arcs in anime. One Piece has made me cry more than any other anime - that may be because of the sheer amount of episodes, but that's not the point. Even if it takes you a decade, One Piece is definitely something worth watching. It has a bit of a rough start, but stick through it. Give it a shot, at least watch the first hundred episodes.",10,Recommended,"Feb 12, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f249ce10d0,28
"TO PEOPLE WHO CRIES OVER THE NUMBER OF EPISODES: GO READ THE MANGA. It's faster, addictive, beautiful background and still with funny jokes, and you waste less time with unnecessary frames of a character's face of suspense. Disadvantage: You'll loss the amazing and memorable seiyuu actors of each character, beautiful fighting scenes, and the amazing openings/endings they have. My introduction: I love One Piece since it aired on TV (Brazil) with few episodes. Besides the brazilian dubbing were extremely awful, it's story got stuck in my head: ""Did he already found One Piece? What it was?"". And then I found the sequel at Skypiea saga. OK LET'S GO Story (9): Every Island, and every character got deep story/past. the winning and funny moments gets repetitive to you give all your heart in it and then Eiichiro Oda can smash your heart and your soul with his hands. Some societies, government, objects also have deep story. The thing really irritates me is the filler. Everytime they want to put a new monster/friend/enemy with unique powers and want strawhat's crew to solve it in a few episodes. Dude, to the story gets OK they have to kick enemy's asses, clarify mysteries, and let some message to spectators. YOU CAN'T DO ALL THIS IN FEW EPISODES IT GETS MESSY, that's why Oda's work last a lot of chapters. If they need to do a filler, make something off-story, nothing too deeper, just an episode for fun. Art (9): This part is where I'm really annoying. Look, I don't care about it's traces since they've changing a lot each arc, improving and getting better. But seriously, why is it getting so colorful? The tons of colors are getting annoying in background, and side characters that don't need it. Seems like the TV series are trying to convince children's audience to keep watching by adding a lot of vibrant colors. The only need to put a vibrant color was to a character with a significant meaning to the plot, and now it's in everywhere. It's cute but makes a unnecessary mess. This is one of the (dumbest) reasons I recommend people to read manga. That's my -1 for Colors. But +5 for improving traces, +2 improving attack effects, +3 Gorgeous backgrounds. Sound (9): The soundtrack are gorgeous, I would really love it if they use more of the old ones. Some sound effects seems already used from another series (like dragonball) and I don't have any reference of a remarkable original sound effect from this series that make me jump OH I KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM, only for OST. Character (10): GURARARARA. oh damn, characters. That's masterpiece seriously. Each one have a memorable lore, or habit, or laugh, even the shape of the body. Well, I can't say that for most female characters tho. Their costumes, clothes are unique. And oh my Lord, the seiyuu they choose for each character are REALLY accurate. Enjoyment (9): If you're watching few episodes, this is your gold moment to laugh, find those videos of funny moments strawhats and give them a like, but the jokes overeactions from characters are getting too repetitive in anime, but manga is still good. Overall (10): I know I rate mostly 9 in each type, but I'm giving it a 10 since there're few works that could achieve 5 types and combine very well together with few failures.",10,Recommended,"Dec 19, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4fd2b0961a,28
"One Piece is the legendary treasure said to be of unimaginable value. It was said to be hidden somewhere deep in the Grand Line, presumably on the last island, Raftel, by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates. No one except the surviving members of the Roger Pirates actually knows where and what the great treasure is. The most popular theory is that they hid it on Raftel, the final island of the Grand Line. Given the recurring theme that a treasure is merely something of great personal value (e.g. Luffy's hat) and that Roger, like Luffy, did not value money or gold, One Piece may be nothing more than an item Gol D. Roger valued. In Buggy's flashback to his days as a member of the Roger Pirates, he discussed with Shanks the meaning of a treasure, and he found that all the crew shared the same views regarding personal value.[1] The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about One Piece.[2] After decades of speculations and doubts, the treasure's existence was confirmed by Whitebeard with his last breath. He mentioned that ""a grand battle will engulf the entire world"" and ""the world will be shaken to its core"" when One Piece is found.[3]",10,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c31c0676dc,28

"I know what everyone thinks when they see One Piece because I have friends who use to tell me these gripes about it. It's too long there's no way I can watch all these episodes or it's not interesting enough for me to pick because the mc looks weak. The art style is too old school for me wouldn't try. I get all these points but I promise you One Piece is a journey worth starting and you won't regret it. Art: 8/10 I know what you're thinking how can you give this an 8 when it looks like an old-school pokemon but I promise the art style is way better than what it starts off with. Obviously, the art style starts off very old school since it first aired in 1999 but during the skypiea arc, I noticed it went HD. The most noticeable change in art style was after the time skip making the fighting sequences more fluid and smoother on the eyes. Story: 9/10 The story has always been a big part of why one piece is so good granted it has fillers like any other long-running series but it's not as bad as Naruto fillers. Currently, only 10% of one piece is filler meaning there are 900 episodes worth watching of good storytelling and world-building delight. The show always made sure to connect all the pieces of one piece's story and made them connect so well it's insane. You'd see a character in an episode or an event happens and then 300 episodes later it comes full circle and connects making the story much richer. There are so many twists and turns as well as many different emotions to be had throughout the series and doesn't shy away from showing the world in a very gritty and dark aspect sometimes which makes it all the more thrilling. Sound: 8/10 The art and sound generally evolved and got better over time together so there is not much to say. I could tell you that they do use music in a very well thought out way making certain scenes more thrilling or suspenseful. It's definitely one of the reasons why so many emotions are had while watching the show. Also, the use of sound effects brings out the depth of a fight, and sometimes events taking place at the time. Character: 10/10 Yes, 10/10 the characters themselves are the biggest reason why One Piece is so damn good without them the show would definitely be harder to watch. The writing of the characters is exceptionally well and is most noticeable for the Straw Hat crew. They each have very deep character build-up and very interesting stories that also connect well with the world around them. They also have their own flaws and their personalities set them apart from other characters. If you think that's it well you're in for a surprise because not only is this done for the Straw Hat crew but also for every character in one piece aside from low-level pirates and marines cannon fodders. This makes most characters in One Piece unique and different from other characters which leaves you with a refreshed feeling when being introduced to a new character. Enjoyment: 8/10 One Piece is differently very enjoyable to watch especially for first-timers who get to binge watch it. I admit at times the show does leave you frustrated at times throughout the series. Such as when Luffy always ends up in the dumbest predicaments leaving him to get washed by low-level grunts who he should easily beat up other times he always somehow avoids the big fights until the very end. Zoro is another case who always gets lost and it makes you want to strangle him or tape a compass to his hand. Aside from doing little things like that the show does a very good job at making feeling a lot of emotion, like excitement during a fight or it makes you cry with its amazing storytelling, and it is especially good at making you laugh. Overall 9/10 Like I said at the beginning of the review this show is differently a journey you should start because you won't be disappointed. With its amazing writing that leaves you wanting more to its character that instantly makes you attach yourself to them to its evolved art style and sound that makes the scene all the more amazing. I promise you you'll feel every type of emotion with this show and it'll make you think that you're grateful you gave it a try. So by all means I recommend you try this show and experience a journey like no other.",9,Recommended,"May 7, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_49c3fde2f7,28
"This is gonna be short review that might seem like I'm about to commit seppuku. By the way it might contain a massive spoiler so that i might get my point across I like One Piece it's an awesome anime with lovable characters and a great story line. The fights are good and the progression is at a steady pace but it really isn't for everyone, doesn't mater when you started watching it or at what age but it might not be for everyone and the reason I feel like such is its conflict/fights in it. This has time and time again got me frustrated to a point where i put off the show and get on a self put hiatus. People might say I'm being petty but it is really annoying, it feels like every fight they either have to stop and talk about their feelings or the good or bad guys trying and convince the either side that their way is best. I know most shounen shows do this but how one piece does it is to a frustrating level. Where my spoiler comes in is in the fight between Luffy and Doflamingo. Since this is after the time skip and a lot of episodes into the show you could say why is it that this particular fight is the reason I'm writing this review, well I always had a slight prick in the back of my mind when i watch the show and never really knew what it was about until i watching this sequence of episodes. The fight just drags on and on and never really reaches a point till luffy unleashes his bouncy man move. The reason this fight is so draggy are those that i previously mention and why i wrote the review is when i re-watched Naruto Shippuden and watched the pain fight. It blew my mind and i got chills, the exact same ones i got when i was in grade 9 watching it for the first time and then it hit me the way this fight is portrayed and done is so good. It give you the time for breathers and then throws you back in the action and if one piece could do this it might be skyrocket up my favourite anime list!",8,Recommended,"Apr 28, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_65abf4d884,28
"No spoilers, no long summaries, only good words. Let me start of by saying that, the love I have for One Piece is beyond of what I could ever write down. I grew up casually watching the show since I was a kid, to binge watching all +600 episodes three times in total, until now, where I’m waiting for a new episode every (other) week for years and reading the manga as well, which the show is based on. Firstly, the world of One Piece is enormous, and I think THAT is what makes the show so unique. Oda’s strength lays in his flow of storytelling and the way he introduces new islands with its own history and its own folks plus new characters in every arc. Everything you learn, you learn slowly, for sure. However, since the world building itself is so unreal, it takes and actually NEEDS time for the viewer to fully understand and comprehend (reasons, explanation of different gears and powers, backstories, side stories, all involved characters and their reasons and backstories) without being completely overrun with new information every new episode. There is a reason for everything that is shown and Oda eventually explains why something happened this way and in that order. Secondly, every arc, hence, every character you will see and meet is different due to its own culture. While it might feel as the story gets drawn out, the chances that you actually forget an island and everything the arc consists of, is quite low. Thirdly and most importantly, Oda somehow manages to address real-life issues as racism, corruption (especially by the government), in/- justice, following your dreams and people that try to take you down, or even slavery, tyranny and murder, while still making it entertain to watch. Intentionally or not, it blows my mind. Additionally, you either fall in love with the characters or you don’t. There is not much character development, only a stronger bond between the crew members. Just to give you a perspective, the story begins with Luffy assembling the crew which already takes 300+ episodes, minus one who joins the crew another 500 episodes later. You will for sure find at least one character or side-character you will enjoy. Also, friendship is a big factor here which helps the crew to protect each other or even strangers that turn into friends when they are in danger, yet, every crew member has their own dreams and goals that they try to achieve and reach while still working as a team. Further, the filler percentage is thankfully very low but even those are funny to watch. The background music always fits well. The art style: an ongoing issue. Oda started out when he was pretty young and the adaptation of the manga started 1999/2000s. I actually really enjoy it, after the first 100 episodes you get used to it and after that, it continuously evolves for the better (minus the exaggeration of unrealistic body shapes for female characters). After all, One Piece is not only an anime but a life-changing experience and will forever hold a very special place. Thank you for reading! P.S: even if it means to watch, read and wait another 20+ years for the story to end, that ending better be gooooooooood!!",10,Recommended,"May 24, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e8ba78ab8d,28

"The One Piece is a really in enjoyable anime! Its about Monkey D. Luffy and his straw hat pirates as they currently adventure through the New World. The Story is Awesome, my only problem with the story is the filler in the anime. From Episodes 1-206 I give the art about a 6/10, but starting with Episode 207 the art really improves as starting with this episode, the anime was in HD. The Sound and Music are good and the Voice acting is good nothing bad there. For the main I love there character! Luffy is dense but in situations he really is smart! Zoro is Bad-Ass even when he sleeps and its funny when he gets lost! And every other straw hats character are awesome to! The anime very funny and comedic, and the fights are awesome. I would have my favorite is the Enies Lobby Arc because I like how it told Robin's backstory and the fights through they show that all of the characters are useful unlike DBZ where Goku gets most of the spot light. Overall i'd give the One Piece anime a 9/10 or 10/10.",10,Recommended,"Sep 24, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c70fc30c91,28
"One Piece is a pirate story centered around the Strawhat Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy Story: The story is a fairly simple one yet amusing. A boy wished to be the Pirate king and step on the footprints of the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger, How will he accomplish his goal? By finidng the mythical teasure left from the former pirate king, the treasures name? One Piece. The quest starts w/ Luffy trying to recruit members for his crew and making his dream come true. His crew though has dreams too which can be accomplished by following the crazy meat-eater Luffy. Ahoy maety, time to set sail. Did I mention that Luffy has eaten the Gomu-Gomu no Mi which gave Luffy the abillity to stretch himself like rubber? What awaits as in the this Pirate world is a mystery yet to see it unfold to it's fullest. 8/10 Art: The animation is this anime is rather dull in the 1st part and get more joyful later on. It's nothing to be amazed at, but it doesn't let you down, We colorful setting and stuff and fanservice for both gentlemen and ladies. I'll say just two sentences for this and end this here. 1st part We get a flat chested Nami and on second part we get a BIG chested Nami. For our ladies? All males have a pretty muscular body which sometimes makes me wonder why I'm not like that. 6/10 Sound: The sound in this anime is quite good and relaxing or intense depending on the situtation. One Piece has usually good OPs and EDs but not to go crazy about which is kinda dissapointing for such a legendary anime. The OST can make you grow some feelings be it anger, laugh or being on the verge. 7/10 Enjoyment: If you like shounen type anime this is definitelly for you since it's fully action packed and has everything a shounen fan loves. The bad thing isn One Piece though is that the recpas are pretty damn annoying in he latest episoded cause they happen on each and every episode, that's riiight! In every ep you can and almost full recap, IDK what TOEI Animation thinks of it's viewers, but we are not so short on memory ppl, we are not goldfishes. All in all though and pretty enjoying anime worth the time. 7/10 So overal I give One Piece and 8/10 cause of the beautifull and ragefull moments it gave me which I actually treasure.

"The story of One Piece is interesting and sometimes engaging. The art is not really appealing and could use major improvements. The sound is not really special or catchy. There are very few songs that will make you cry or jump out of your seat. The characters in the East Blue arc have really heartbreaking and solid background stories. I like how all of them have goals that they want to accomplish. It is nice to see a group of characters with different goals, but overall the same purpose. Which is to help Monkey D. Luffy become the pirate king. Sadly, with all this said I'm still disappointed. I do not like how the characters are just brushed over and there is no expansion on their foundational stories. It feels like they are introduced, their stories are told, and then immediately cast aside as side characters. I would like to see them develop more and actually see the progress they each made to fulfilling their goals.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 1, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2363683721,28
"I love One Piece. I love its story, the way they set a goal and deliver to their audience, the character developement, background... you get it. The thing is, I can not recommend this anime to anybody. All the things mentioned above are found in the manga and in the anime, but the latter absolutely destroys the hype, the pacing, and the viewer's eyeballs. So I just recommend reading the manga. The reasons I cant recommend it are the following: - As of right now, one chapter of manga equals one episode of anime, meaning that every anime episode is extremely slow paced and with excessively long and frequent freeze frames. - The animation is just dreadful... at the beginning it was fine, but around episode 400 the animation has gone downhill non-stop. And yes, I am aware that the animation gets better on the latest arc, but still, it's a good 500 episodes of thrash animation. It is really hard to watch something that you love get mistreated. That is why I decided to stop watching one piece and started reading it, the experience has been amazing so far, living each moment again, with proper pacing this time, and not feeling like I am wasting my time. If you want an amazing story with great, lovable characters and have a lot of time to spare, then prepare to embark in the amazing experience that is One Piece, but please, don't watch, just read.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 6, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b8469e6865,28
I honestly dont know why this anime is so popular lets begin the review lets begin with the story I will say seems really interesting has a lot of potential but the story is about Luffy who wants to be king of the pirates and trys to make that dream come true with his growing crew. next the characters the characters seem very plain to be fair I really did not get to far into this anime the characters seem interesting with a cool back story if i could actual keep watching it which brings me into my next point is the filler/pacing of this show and this is where it so horrible I watch 23 episodes almost nothing really has happen to progress the story and doesn't really cover any back stories. the one thing I really like about this anime is the action and fighting scenes in this anime the sound and art are ok. Overall I really think I would enjoy this anime if there wasn't so many episodes and the pacing wasn't bad people say to read the manga instead it has almost no filler and the pacing is a lot better. I will try the manga out and review but as for the anime it seems to have a lot of potential but to much filler and pacing is god awful.,4,Not Recommended,"Mar 16, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0e69d10b37,29
"For a long time, which series has been heralded as the best shounen of all time? DBZ? Hokuto? Naruto? Yu Yu Hakusho? Well it's neither. Because One Piece is one such shounen. Story wise, it is one of the best. The arcs protrayed are unique and interesting at every turn, with Oda always finding a way to surprise the reader with curve balls. The world of One Piece is one of the best, never have I seen such a world ripe with originality and creativity. Art wise? It evolves over time in the manga, and the anime art is a bit stagnant, but when the good fluid art is called for, it gets called. Not as good as most shounen but hey, art shouldn't be the be -all end-all. Sound? It's...okay. Some parts are good and unique and fit the story, although the soundtrack can get repetitive and they haven't really added anything new in a while. Plus the OP themes are hit or miss for me. The characters are fun to watch and it's cool to see them grow. Luffy? He's wiser now after the Marinford War(in his own way. See Fishman Island arc). Usopp? More like MANSOPP. I don't want to go paragraph into paragraph but all the characters grow and seeing them bloom is great. Plus they are fun to watch, love, hate, and admire. Plus there is some good comedy. Enjoyment? Easily a fun and enjoyable long running anime/manga. I enjoy every week there is a chapter or episode.",9,Recommended,"Jul 31, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cb628a1519,29
"Plot. The last words spoken by the Pirate King before his execution, have inspired many: «My treasure? Take them if you can! Now you know where I left them!». The legendary phrase Gold D. Roger marked the start the Great Age Pirates — thousands of people in the pursuit of their dreams went to the Grand Line, the most dangerous place in the world, wanting to become owners of a mythical treasure... But every year the romantics became less their gradually squeezed pragmatic pirates-robbers who loot was much closer than some «worthless dreams». But then, one fine day, a seventeen year old Luffy cherished dream has executed childhood — went to sea. His goal — neither more nor less than become the new Pirate King. Over the short enough term the young captain manages to put together a team consisting of not less ambitious adventure seekers. And let by them driven by completely different aspirations, most importantly, these guys are not as important money and fame, how much much more valuable — the principles and loyalty to friends. And yet — the service of a dream. Well, while on the Grand Line swim such people, the Great Age Pirates will always be with us! Brief introduction. The story itself, though quite simple at first glance, but it quickly evolved into something huge. Most of the very first episode focuses on team building and meet new characters. Although this is certainly not enough more action. But as soon as they catch up with the Grand Line, adventure go for adventure, and you can see a lot of fantastic-story arcs. Battles and fights well developed; fight the final boss is always completely full of epic. The episodes are full of lots of funny moments, not too much and not too little. There's always a delicate balance of action and humor. Design. At the expense of design. It is true, it is completely different from all the anime I've seen. But even so, you'll love it. Style change over time... still would! After a few years will pass and «One Piece» we will see in «new light». Cinematography (4:3) change in the anamorphic image (16:9). As a result, there will be more clear, bright, clean and colorful image. But despite these changes, the schedule 1999 has not lost its uniqueness and I love her still. )) Review. Some few years ago, «One Piece» promptly rushed into my life by becoming an integral part of it, decorate her own, unprecedented up to this point, paints. This anime was the ray of light, which I did not have all the time... a ray that shines to this day and will shine for me a very long time, if not forever. In fact, «One Piece» became my way of life, without exaggeration. In it there are so thin «highlight» that if the catches, then so thoroughly and deeply that permeates through the soul, and forget it ever anime, but rather that track that has left more than 350+ episodes of view, which looked at one go in record time, it is impossible. Of course, this is purely my personal opinion and experience. «One Piece» — is a constant drive that runs through you from head to toe. It's so crazy adventure, colorful characters, and a great atmosphere, I believe that «One Piece» One of the few things that can be considered perfect. At the moment, more than 678 episodes drawn, and it's not a terrible figure to show, on the contrary, each episode is so interesting and fascinating that when viewing exactly half of the episodes, you begin to frighten the thought that there is still the same, and in fact looks at one go and episodes of flying is not noticeable. «One Piece» — is one big pirate adventure story, with the supervision of that, you become a witness, unimaginable adventure through the red tape that goes the theme of dreams. This is another huge plus for the whole idea of «One Piece», for this many thanks Ode Eiichiro. Dream - it's an incentive to go forward, to make progress, as well as live. This motif is thoroughly imbued with the entire anime series and its protagonists, who are each his dream, but they are making it all together. To sum up the above logic, although I believe that I could write at length on several pages of this wonderful anime, the conclusion suggests itself: «One Piece» — a bright pearl among all the anime genre shounen and adventure anime-series. He remains in my heart for ever, and do not forget while watching another anime. Those who did not look — look, those who viewed themselves soon want to reconsider. Of course this is again my personal opinion, but, hell, «One Piece» — a masterpiece! Soundtrack. I want to give due attention to the soundtrack. He is a great! Not only OST's but OP&ED. General impressions. Best Anime and best Shounen who saw and probably ever will see. Anime rest on his background seems boring and predictable set of fillers... Finally. The most beautiful and noble of all the anime I've ever seen. I think that «One Piece» in Russian — a world of the soul. Verdict.

"This show does not deserve such a high score. Not anymore. For the longest time it baffled me that this was such a popular series in Japan. I caught glimpses of the 4kids dub on TV and was immediately turned off by it. Then in 2011 I actually knew some Japanese friends who liked the show and they eventually convinced me to give it a chance with the original version. I remember their claim that Oda (the creator) said the series would likely go on for another fifteen years. Given that and the fact that the show was already near the end of the Punk Hazard arc, or over 600 episodes, by the time I began watching, I was more than a little daunted by the whole undertaking. After giving it a chance, for several years I was obsessed. A huge fan. But, I don't know: I grew weary. Here's the short of it: For what it is, the story, and by extension the manga I assume, is quite good. It can really only be compared to other long-running shounen type shows, and in that respect it is much smarter in the construction of the story. Story beats and elements are thought through well ahead of time and not just pulled out of nowhere week after week. The characters are both likable and memorable. The comedic moments are funny, and the dramatic moments are really sad. The music is repetitive if you're bingeing the whole show in one go but it does achieve the proper effect on the listener in evoking a sense of adventure on the seas. Now here's where I give it mediocre score for enjoyment: The pacing gets abysmal after a while. The opening theme gets longer and longer with shittier music, followed by a secondary opening, and then a recap almost as long as the opening itself. Once you've caught up and you're watching the episodes premiere weekly it becomes even more of a slog. You've waited an entire week to see the continuation of the story and when the new episode finally drops you get like two minutes worth of content stretched out to fill 20 minutes. It feels as if watching the episode didn't even matter. As a result, almost no stand alone episode is good. Cumulatively the story is good, but this show would be so much better if they took time off to let the manga gain some distance from the anime. Another issue is the constant use of flashbacks to fill up time, sometimes entire strings of episodes are just flashbacks piled on flashbacks with a minute of new content. They used to bother me but lately not so much because often times it has literally been a decade or two since a scene they reference has premiered. I just don't remember what happened anymore. I'm going to continue to stick with the anime and not switch over to the manga, but that is not a recommendation for everybody. I hope that one day they release a ""Kai"" version of this show that gives it a more consistent style and has tighter pacing for the story. THAT I could give a higher score.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_953ba972f9,29
"Many people tend to criticise One Piece by pointing out its rather lengthy episode list. Whenever I ask someone why One Piece is bad they either refer to the phrase 'I don't want to watch it because it's too long' or 'It's bad because it's too long' and in my personal opinion those are quite stupid criticisms. Yes, whilst the length of One Piece is quite long the whole journey of the characters is extremely intriguing to delve into. You easily get attached to each character and their development. Oda's genius writing skills really hook you in. Although the start of One Piece is quite slow, it's a good build-up into the epic journey the crew goes onto. The storyline and characters are just so unique and compelling. If I could pick an anime with the most interesting characters I would definitely consider One Piece as one of them. Each character is so unique and have their own traits that make them stand out to you. You feel yourself getting emotionally attached and rooting for a plethora of characters, even side characters that barely get any screentime. Another attribute that I love about One Piece is Oda's representation of real world problems, he portrays slavery, poverty, racism, injustice and how people we view as good authority figures hide so much from us and cause havoc. It's so heartbreaking and compelling to watch how characters struggle from such real issues. I would really recommend anyone who is too nervous to watch One Piece to give at least 20-50 episodes a try and drop it if they find it boring (which would be rare). For those who don't want an anime with suffering pacing sometimes, I would definitely recommend the One Piece manga (In my opinion one of the best mangas to ever be written)",10,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a8575b6e86,29
"One Piece is overall, a amazing and alluring story. The story is really well thought of. It has its originality of Devil Fruits, Haki and such. Especially the Pirate Era, the shichibukai system and the 4 emperors of the Grand Line. Though it took inspiration from the anime ""Dragon Ball Z"" an Oda took some real life pirates and turned them into his own, taking bits of them into his characters. One Piece, as a long-running anime, was and is a very large piece of hard work. Oda has to keep it exciting with epic fight scenes, cliffhangers (Which I think he's amazing at), and emotional touching scenes. Oda is also really good at foreshadowing, because he has foreshadowed many things from the very beginning of One Piece up to even episode 500+. I do not wish to spoil any of those foreshadowing. Back to the subject, Oda makes One Piece successful by keeping the interest flowing (Which he does by the good plot lines of each arc) so that at the end of each anime/manga episode/chapter makes you crave more and more. But that interest will sometimes drop when the fillers come, though some of the fillers are also interesting and hilarious on some occasions. The interest also seems to fall rapidly because of the extremely slow pacing in any arc Oda makes. Like each big arc (Like East Blue, Alabasta, Sky Island), they all have more than 50 episodes. And 50 episodes is about as long as a year. That's why some people don't want to watch One Piece. But, if you have the patience to sit down and just watch, I can assure you, there is a very high change you'll enjoy One Piece, a lot. Art? No, it's not the best. At the beginning of One Piece, I have to be honest, the art was pretty bad. But remember this was drawn in the 1990's and they didn't have good technology. The story sometimes can distract you from the art so sometimes when the story gets good, you'll just get dragged into the story deeper and you'll forget everything about the art. Thankfully, the art improves greatly as the story progresses. The most noticeable improvement starts about around the Water 7 arc which is about episode 200 or so. By then, the story gets amazing good and you'll start to not care about the art. Then, by episode 500, the art is really good. Compared to episode's 1 art to episode 500's, 500 is like the king of pirates while episode 1 is a small frog in a well (Couldn't help but quoting Mihawk there XD). It still isn't the best animation but it still earns about a 8/10 by episode 500. One Piece has a very large variety of sounds that fit the scene super well. From the slurp of noodles to a cymbal clap. As for the soundtracks... 10/10, no question. Now I don't know about you but One Piece has many soundtracks that you could fall in love with and each scene in the anime, Toei Animation knows exactly what soundtrack it goes with and it fits so good, it's like finding the last piece of a puzzle and fitting it in, completing the puzzle. How do they do it? The soundtrack they choose is literally like finding a couple that were meant to be soulmates. The music can go to happy, then immediately go into a emotional melody. The openings are the same too. The first opening, ""We Are!"", is super catchy and I just can't help but sing along with it. And I love it when they make ""We Are"" with different voices or recreate it into a different opening. There are a total of 3 ""We Are"" openings. Actually, all of the One Piece openings are catchy and loveable. I also enjoy the narrations in the openings too! One of the best pros of One Piece is the outstanding character development. Each introduced character has a very unique personality. I don't think any of the introduced characters in One Piece have very similar personalities. That's just my opinion. Like Nami, who is pretty mature and takes things serious but then turns into a deceiving mischievous cat when it comes to getting money. Like Zoro, who is very strong but gets lost super easily even when someone is telling him directions. Sanji, who acts cool and is a great cook but loses his cool immediately when he comes across a pretty lady. And Luffy who is a drooling dog when he sees food but can be the most loveable, understanding, mature idiot ever. I don't know but Luffy knows the exact words that people need to hear. I really enjoyed this anime, as you can tell. My brother started watching One Piece about 4 months before me and it was all I heard him talking about. So, when Winter break started, I decided to start watching One Piece. My brother told me that in the beginning, One Piece was very slow but too me, like him, I fell in love with One Piece on the very very first episode. I actually caught up to episode 700 in a month. That's how good it was for me. Overall, I rate this a proud 11/10.",10,Recommended,"Apr 18, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_52517b30e8,29
"I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Now let's talk about the anime itself: STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward,a young boy Monkey D. Luffy(17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King,Gol D. Roger.Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates.The series is divided into arcs,each featuring its very own story and setting,each island,each place the straw hat pirates(Luffy and his crew)visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances.And that's one of the best things of OP,you never get bored.You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it.Everything is interesting and everything is fun,Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers.Thats something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly.Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series,especially Luffy,don't really care about their destination,hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all.All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things,get stronger,meet new people and face powerful foes.Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers(episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto,Bleach anyone?).Also the fillers are actually not that bad,sure they are not good but many of them are OK.And thats a huge plus for an anime series. CHARACTERS:This is where OP really shines.Each character is presented with great detail,they are all quite unique.Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are,why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams.Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other.We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other,they become something very close to a family.That's the kind of bonds they make.Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines.We see why they make the kind of choices they make.Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good.Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause,in their own justice and in their own dreams. ART AND SOUND:One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation.The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics.The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other(that's a huge plus in anime).The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors,I'm always talking about the original Japanese(don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters.The music,for me at least,is very catchy and actually really well made.However that depends on personal taste,if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it.Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime. OVERALL ENJOYMENT:One Piece is one of the most,if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find.It really excels in pretty much every field there is.It is the only anime series,or any series,I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me,have I seen a lot).I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure.If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not(oh you will want to continue).Trust me and you won't regret it,just like I did.",10,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fc7a7b63a2,29

"The overall premise of One Piece isa that the world is divided between pirates and Marines! Constently at each others necks resulting in grand battles, exhilarting fights, tear- worthy moments, meaning a whole lot of snot! Such moving story lines, that truly make you fall in love with the characters, and become invested in their dreams and aspirations. If during this anime you don't get emotionally moved, then your most likely dead inside. As we watch our heros battle their harships and as we fanboy/fangirl over their sheer badassness moments that not even the biggest narutards can object to! If this review will get at least one person to watch One Piece than I'd write it a thousand times. The voice acting is fantastic, especially when emotional moments are demanding more. Themes such true companionship, following your dreams no matter the hardship, and truly putting your life on the line for what you believe in, are played out truly beautifully. Almost changing part of the person experiencing the world of One Piece! Hands down this is truly a wonderful adventure. If i had one wish is that One Piece's grand existence never disappears, because this anime/manga is importilised in the heart of it's viewers. By the first episode this 'Monkey . D. Luffy' will have an impression on you whether you like it or not, and One Piece will simply never end from there.

"One Piece is one of those anime that really pull you into its world. It had me hooked from episode 1 and before I knew it 8 months had passed and I had caught up on its many episodes, movies, specials, and any other content I could see. Now every Sunday when the new episode comes out I'm like a kid on Christmas morning. I know I'll be sailing with Monkey D. Luffy until the show's conclusion. Story: 10 I gave the story a 10 because of how imaginative it truly is. Revelations and new developments in this story are constantly coming at you. This means the story never gets repetitive or boring. Additionally the story will have you asking yourself many interesting philosophical questions. Here are just a few of the questions this show may have you thinking about: What is Justice? What is good and evil? What is really important in life? What does it mean to be free? Better yet it does this without ever feeling preachy. The story also has great themes of friendship (friendships as strong as familial ties) and amazing adventure! Art: 10 The art-style in this show is really unique. It is instantly recognizable and fits the show perfectly. All the color really brings the expansive One Piece world to life. Character designs are all very distinct and some of the most eye catching in anime. The fights and all the special attacks are breathtaking. Sound: 10 The soundtrack in this show is extremely versatile and varied. It has pieces that fit every mood. The openings and endings all sound great. These tracks really provoke emotion. Songs that will make you smile ear to ear, songs that will make you sob, songs that make you feel tense and excited - It has it all! Characters: 10 One Piece really shines in this category. Every character has a distinct personality, motives, beliefs, and their chance to shine in the story. The cast of characters are extremely lovable and quirky. Monkey D. Luffy and his crew all have hearts of gold. Enjoyment 10: I find One Piece extremely enjoyable. It has everything I am looking for in an anime. It keeps me excited, invested, and completely enamored with the characters and plot. It pulls you into its adventure so well! Overall: 10 I would strongly advise watching this show. It is a time investment to watch all the way up to date, but I did it and it was well worth it to me. It is the kind of show that has something for everyone and so can be enjoyed by nearly anyone! Happy sailing!",10,Recommended,"Mar 28, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2c58b49c24,29

"One Piece is the greatest story ever told by mankind, a little flawed yet it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. Thank you Oda, for making my life worth living, I re watched it twice, I still find it so fresh and valuable. I have a tattoo of One Piece on my heart. From the top notch writing to the unique character designs and development to bad ass quotations to the most iconic moments in Shonen anime history, One Piece has everything what an anime fan has to look for before calling it home. I live my life following One Piece each and every second. There's only one thing I'm always worried about One Piece, there's a lot story to be revealed, I want it to continue for more 700-800 episodes (1000 chapters) which would take 15 years, to give importance to each and every unsolved mystery in One Piece, and not to forget the character development, I want the straw hats to look legendary before they get the One Piece. I'm pretty sure Oda will never disappoint me and million fans who are excited to know more about the greatest story ever witnessed in the history of mankind!",10,Recommended,"Mar 6, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_831b59074d,29

The story is great..the art is good and the characters are just awesome!! I found myself fangirling so many times! Well, i'll have to admit that at first it wasn't that exciting and the art wasn't that good but now is so exciting that i find it very hard to wait every week for the new episode to be released and the art has improved too..Another thing that i liked was how nicely were the fillers put in the story. They weren't too long and they were put so cleverly in the story that i didn't even realize it was fillers. I also liked the comedy very much.

"This is a positive review. I am going to express my spite for many parts of the show in a brutally honest way, but overall I am arguing that this is a beautifully rare specimen of the world. The FLAWS of One Piece: 1) It is an epic, and it is dragging us around. It is too long and slow, and they want it that way: to keep us watching for 10 to 15 more years. (I personally think that the series could have had an open-ended finale at the Summit War) 2) It's a Shounen. We are all familiar with the flaws here, some weird race to ""who is the most powerful in the universe"", nonsensical arguments about the rankings of strength, Highlander ""there can only be one"" sentiments, shitty intro music, etc. What really irks me is that this has really gotten worse over time. The first few seasons are actually guilt free these problems. During the Skypiea saga Oda really signs the lease on a Shounen when enemy attacks have DBZ sound effects, and the action scenes are outsourced to fight scene specialists that botch Luffy's facial expressions (which are a highlight for me). 3) It's repetitive: as said in other reviews, every country they visit has more or less the same dilemma: evil ruler, Luffy kicks their ass. Except it takes 100 episodes. Every female character is mostly boobs, supporting characters have weird laughs, Luffy protects his nakama, and anyone who sees Luffy fight believes he will become pirate king, which is meant to keep the drug-addicted super fan on the edge of their seat for another 15 years thinking ""OH MAN IS HE REALLY GONNA DO IT??"" THE GOOD PARTS OF ONE PIECE THAT MAKE THESE THINGS FORGIVABLE 1) It's really fucking original and creative. On one end, the Shounen aspects seem unoriginal. But I don't think we can overlook the fact that the main character is a happy-go-lucky adopted straw-hat rubber-man, and he is but one of the hundreds of amazingly interesting characters. I haven't seen any other anime that unleashes the author's insane ideas as much as One Piece. In terms of content, this show is definitely one of the most unique I have come across. 2) The dramatic side is actually really interesting. Earlier I mentioned a shift in the show during the Skypiea saga. While I dislike much of the production quality that changed at this time, this saga added an additional layer to the show that I think becomes one of the reasons that keeps us watching. While each individual saga is predictable (mean ruler, Luffy beats them up, nobody dies), the overarching story has multiple levels of intrigue, and the length of the show is actually effectively utilized to create a multi-dimensional story arc. 3) The MOST important: the universe... it's amazing. The characters, the geography, the islands, everything. Since the show is so slow, I almost want to recommend the manga, but truthfully it's fun to see these ideas come to life with color, movement, and sound. While I have mostly talked about suspense, I would here like to say that One Piece is good because it is FUN. Despite the repetition, I think it's amazing to see Oda/Luffy/Roger's idea of what a pirate is: someone who sets sail in search of adventure. With that premise in mind, Oda took aspects of Earth and made them cartoony, dangerous, and exciting for Luffy to encounter throughout his journey. This craving of adventure sets an optimistic tone for the whole series, and while it is often cliche and predictable, that doesn't depreciate from my liking of the Strawhat pirate crew when they are already such a unique hodgepodge of individuals. I truly believe that buried in this crazy story, are Oda's opinions about how people should genuinely treat their human position. Any hesitance to watch the show due to the fact that its is already almost 800 episodes long is totally valid. But if you are capable of diving into a lengthy series, and are making the decision betweens epic sagas, I think that One Piece is the king (yeahyeah, funny) of this genre.",8,Recommended,"Mar 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bb31ebe401,29
"Let's start by saying that i'm really really nostalgic about this anime. One Piece, after DB and Pokemon, was one of the first big anime that aired in my country post 90s. I fondly remember the Skypea and Enies Lobby arcs from elementary/middle school, and i think i could say it's, together with Dragon Ball and Maojin Guru (an anime that seemed to have disappeared from the collective memory but i really loved it as a kid lmao), the anime that really got me into this world. But, like for Dragon Ball, 15+ years later i'm forced to face reality and admit that, among the more mainstream modern ones, it's probably one of the worst adaptation ever made. Yes, it doesn't have the same amount of filler Naruto or DB has, but honestly i've never considered filler arcs that much of a problem, since you can always skip those. The fact is that, beside filler arcs there's A LOT of filer scenes in canon episodes, making them impossible to skip, and a lot of times those filler aren't just useless, but straight up ruining the story, for example Ace joining the straw hats in Alabasta (completely contradicting what is supposed to be the relationship between Luffy and Ace, that is of affection, yes, but also of strict mutual indipendency), and them finding a goddamn poigne griffe before they're existence was revealed in the MIDDLE OF THE DESERT (for real Toei? Are you really going to pull out such a bullshit ruining one of the most interesting and important plot point in all One Piece?). Graphically it has some great moments, especially in some of the most tense scenes (for example the celestial dragon punch was greatly made), but on average it isn't particularly good (especially when compared to the great style of the manga, very toriyamesque but still original in the beginning and very detailed later on), and sometimes straight up bad and weird. Of course the main problem, at the cost of being very unoriginal, is the dreadful pacing. One Piece is a long manga, no doubt about it, it will soon hit the volume 101, but that in NO WAY justify a 1000+ episodes series. The episodes/chapters rateo is basically 1:1. Now, sometimes One Piece, manga-wise too, is very slow, especially read chapter by chapter (i'm sincerely convinced most of the talk about ""One Piece decline after time-skip"" is due to the fact that the people that started to binge-reading the series when it was around Marineford had to start readng chapter by chapter and found it slow, but actually OP always had its slow moments). On the other hand read in volumes or binged the feeling is completely different. That's not really true for the anime tho, by rewatching some of it i really understood why Skypea arc (imo in the top 3 arcs in the manga) is perceived by a lot of anime-only fans as boring and skippable, because it is there, it's very slow and most episodes really feel like useless. I suggest anyone that could think this and have only seen the anime to try reading the manga, they'll notice that most criticism defenitely doesn't apply there. I didn't reach the anime version of Dressorosa because i'm no masochist, but i have to say that i got the chills down my spine seeing that a 10 volume arc (and already pretty low-paced) was in total 120 EPISODES. That's insane, there's no justification for that, any filler arc to let the manga catch up (or, listen carefully dear Toei, maybe even A PAUSE, yes i know it's a scary word that doesn't make you do katching) would have been better than such a choice. This obviously is an enormous smack on the enjoyment of the series, and i genuinely believe the only reason why i didn't notice this as a kid was because, well, the Dragon Ball anime had a similar problem and already accustomed us to this kind of production. But nowadays, that luckily anime air in seasons and the pacing isn't screwed up like it was (One Piece is the only one still produced that way), this aspect become way more evident. Let's finish with the sounds, here i had to make an average: the opening and endings of this anime are really top tier, incredibly iconic and brilliant. On the other hand most times i found the music during the scenes sometimes useless and sometimes really annoying (well, except when thet play ""We Are"", that will never not be cool). I would like to explain this using some examples: on one hand we have the two great Luffy/Nami scenes in Arlong Park, ""Luffy, taskete"" and ""Nami! Omae wa ore no nakamada!"". Those scenes are obviously great in the manga, and they are actually very very good in the anime too, the absence of music during these moments, with only some fleble background noises, with the music starting only at the peak of pathos are brilliantly realized. On the other hand we have the Robin ""I want to live"" moment, another incredibly iconic moment in the manga, that arguably even surpass in pathos Nami's one. In the anime? Not so much, specifically because of the music that doesn't really match the moment and wasn't really necessary in general. I get this will be the most controversial aspect of this review, since a lot of people actually prefer anime over manga for this specific reason, but i really don't see the necessity of it at all in a scene like this, it only subtract atmosphere. Since i really don't want to exclusively be negative on an anime that basically made part of the person i am now i'll close with the two only scenes that were actually extremely well done in the anime specifically because of the music/visuals relation, the end of Alabasta and the Sogeking theme song, those were top tier but sadly it's not enough to save this anime. If you take a look at my profile i gave the One Piece manga an 8, sadly when we go to the anime version i really can't go higher than a mere 5",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 9, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_20d5623feb,29
"I just can't anymore. Every episode is just the same thing over and over. It's a show that had maybe 48 episodes at most of entertainment to provide but they just keep dragging it out. And I wish it was something warranties extending it. Maybe making new seasons about new characters, where it's just set in the same world. But this is a plot that should have a start and a finish but drags it out. I'm sad to say it's very reminiscent of what the 90s was to DragonBall series, it's an amazing intro anime that draws fans in and never, ever let's them go. You love it because you LOVED it, not because it's still great. You could skip a few dozen episodes and at most you just need a 5 minute intro to the new flavor of the week side characters. If this is your first animals, i don't judge you at all for keeping it going. There's a nostalgic feeling. Much like DragonBall and even Pokémon fans.

It's a bit gory too, but not in a shocking way. The storyline is frankly perfect. i do find it a bit sad that the female characters the crew currently has don't have one on one fights too often, but that's because one of them is currently too weak and the other one's too strong. the animation is also great (although i think it got a bit worse lately, based off the clips that i see on crunchyroll) but the fights are still really goofy and intelligent. don't get discouraged by the amount of episodes there are!",9,Recommended,"Jan 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4dc3907c65,29
"One piece is the richest universes of anime, mysteries that hold him during the work. Character development, dreams and beliefs are one of the best points of the job. The comic relief at the beginning of the job is good, but it can take some scenes unnecessarily. Another point is the lack of significant impacts in relation to deaths or tragedies that really impact history and events, which can cause much more impact or drama in scenes that are important for the development or landmark of the story, but this is an author's perspective that does not kills characters. Besides, it is an excellent work in development that is approaching its final stretch, recently completed 1000 chapters and we still do not know the greatest mysteries in the universe, that is, it still has a lot to say about this incredible mangá.",8,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ce00f1d3fc,29
"One Piece Review – The Treasure of Storytelling In the vast ocean of anime, One Piece stands tall like a lighthouse—an enduring symbol of storytelling brilliance, thematic depth, and sheer narrative ambition. Created by Eiichiro Oda and first serialized in 1997, One Piece is not just a story about pirates; it’s a tale of dreams, freedom, found family, sacrifice, and unbreakable will. With over 1,000 episodes and counting, and a manga that's entered the final saga, One Piece is a cultural juggernaut that continues to shape generations of fans across the world. At its heart, One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy, a rubber-bodied boy with a straw hat and an unshakeable smile, as he sets out to become the King of the Pirates. To do this, he must reach the end of the Grand Line and find the legendary treasure known as the One Piece, left behind by the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. But the story isn’t just about Luffy’s ambition. It’s about the journey—the people he meets, the struggles they endure, and the bonds they form. Storytelling That Ages Like Wine What makes One Piece special isn’t just its length—it’s what Oda does with that length. Each arc, no matter how long or short, adds a meaningful piece to the puzzle. From the comedic and heartfelt early arcs like Arlong Park and Drum Island, to the political and emotional roller coasters of Enies Lobby, Marineford, and Wano, the series continues to raise the stakes without ever losing its core identity. Every arc feels like its own world, with unique cultures, villains, and emotional payoffs. Oda crafts intricate lore that ties back into itself even hundreds of chapters later. A minor character introduced in episode 20 might return 500 episodes later with crucial information. This long-term storytelling rewards loyal viewers and rewatchers alike. Rarely does an anime so sprawling feel so cohesive. And when it comes to emotional highs, One Piece delivers like few others can. Whether it's Robin’s “I want to live!” moment in Enies Lobby, Ace’s tragic end at Marineford, or Luffy punching the Celestial Dragon to defend Camie, the show punches you in the heart while pushing the narrative forward. A Cast as Rich as the World One Piece’s greatest strength lies in its characters. Luffy is a refreshingly straightforward protagonist. He isn’t the smartest or most strategic, but his moral compass is so unshakably pure that even gods and kings must bow before it. He doesn’t want to conquer the world—he wants to explore it, and his charisma naturally pulls powerful individuals to his side. Each Straw Hat has a dream, and each dream feels worthy of the journey. Zoro’s vow to be the world’s strongest swordsman, Nami’s quest to draw a map of the world, Usopp’s wish to become a brave warrior of the sea—these goals might sound simple, but the emotional baggage behind them is anything but. Watching these characters grow, face their pasts, and support each other is one of the show’s richest rewards. Even side characters and villains are layered. From tragic enemies like Katakuri to grotesque tyrants like Doflamingo, Oda has a gift for making even his villains sympathetic or at least entertaining. And with political entities like the World Government, Celestial Dragons, and Revolutionary Army, the lines between good and evil are often blurred. World-Building Masterclass If Tolkien built Middle-earth and Martin built Westeros, then Oda has built a world that could rival both. The One Piece world is made up of a fragmented ocean with powerful currents, strange islands, and cultural diversity that mirrors the real world in exaggerated form. Each island feels like its own novel. Skypiea gave us sky warfare and religious oppression; Water 7 gave us political intrigue and shipwrights; Thriller Bark dabbled in horror and gothic tropes. This world is not static. The actions of Luffy and his crew ripple across the globe, changing governments, inspiring revolutions, and shaking the foundations of power. The world has a history—an ancient one involving a forgotten kingdom, the Void Century, and a mysterious group of powerful individuals known as the Five Elders. Oda seeds this lore subtly, building anticipation for answers that may only come hundreds of chapters later. Art and Animation Visually, One Piece can be a bit of a mixed bag. Oda’s art style is distinct—full of exaggerated expressions, quirky designs, and imaginative creatures. However, some early episodes suffer from dated animation and pacing issues. Thankfully, the quality improves over time, especially from the Wano Arc onward. Toei Animation revamped its approach with cinematic direction, fluid action sequences, and bold color palettes. Episode 1015, which adapts a crucial moment from the manga, was hailed as one of the best anime episodes of the decade. Still, One Piece’s greatest visual asset is its creativity. The Devil Fruits grant outlandish powers that fuel unpredictable fights. You’ll see everything from a man who can split his body like a jigsaw puzzle to another who can manipulate gravity. It’s cartoonish, sure—but that’s the point. One Piece doesn’t try to be cool in a traditional sense. It embraces absurdity, then makes you care deeply about it. Themes That Resonate At its core, One Piece is about freedom—the freedom to dream, to live by your own code, to fight for what you believe in. It’s about found family, loyalty, and the cost of chasing your ideals. It’s anti-authoritarian, often critical of corrupt systems and the people who uphold them. It asks tough questions about justice, revenge, and redemption. These themes are explored not through preachy dialogue, but through action, sacrifice, and choice. When Luffy declares war on the World Government to save one friend, it means something. When the Straw Hats burn their ship, the Going Merry, and cry together, it’s not just a ship—it’s a symbol of their journey. Flaws and Pacing No masterpiece is without flaws. One Piece’s biggest weakness is its pacing, especially in the anime. Due to its close proximity to the manga, Toei has often padded episodes with flashbacks and reaction shots. Some arcs that felt tight in the manga become sluggish on screen. New viewers may struggle with the sheer volume of content and the slow burn of early arcs. Additionally, some designs can be off-putting, and the humor—while charming to many—can feel juvenile to some. The sheer scope can also be intimidating. Watching or reading over 1,000 chapters is a major commitment, and One Piece demands patience and investment. Conclusion – A True Epic Despite these issues, One Piece remains a triumph of serialized storytelling. It is anime’s greatest long-form epic, a tale that rewards endurance with unparalleled emotional and narrative payoffs. Few works of fiction can match its ambition, creativity, or heart. If you stick with it, One Piece isn’t just a show you watch—it becomes part of your life. The Straw Hats feel like family. Their triumphs become your triumphs. Their sorrows hit you like cannonballs. And when they smile, it reminds you why you started watching in the first place. Final Verdict: 9/10 One Piece is not perfect, but it’s undeniably legendary. It’s a story that believes in dreams—and makes you believe in them too.",9,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c12fa67a94,29
"On the bottom is my original review when I decided I was disappointed with One Piece. I stopped watching it in 2019 and decided I don't care about it anymore, but recently in 2025, I had the urge to catch up again on what I've missed. I started watching the One Pace version and in a few weeks I caught up on all I've missed. What I realized was that I was heavily invested in the series and in the end it had lead to a massive burnout. I liked every part of what I missed for the past 6 years and the way the story progressed really evoked feelings in me and I was able to empathize with the characters and was excited to see how things will pan out. Probably all the points I listed in my original review, now I don't agree with anymore. You can literally read my old review with inverted meaning and understand how I feel about One Piece at the moment. The story has progressed very well, it has become more mature, characters have evolved and their personalities as well. The happy-go-lucky story in the beginning that I liked and later missed since it started becoming more serious is something that was needed to happen and now I totally understand why. The way events are unfolding up to the latest episode at this time (1133), it means thing will become more serious and grand as they move on. I have actually become excited once again to see One Piece through to the end. I think at this point, I can say that the story of One Piece is and will be the most massive, exciting and well thought out story in any Shounen anime so far. All the conspiracies and mysteries will be well worth waiting for. To conclude my updated review, I want to express the opinion that it's possible for a lot of people to experience burnout from such a long story and feel like it's progressing really slowly. And what I've done without doing it consciously is probably the best way to deal with it. If you reach the latest episode and for a while you've felt like it's boring, slow and you can't wait to see what happens next, but feel like you can't stand the waiting, just give it a break. Give it a few years to evolve and while you wait do other things and watch other things and when you come back, you will definitely rekindle your excitement about One Piece. I don't know how many more years there are until One Piece is finally concluded, but I felt between Wano and Egghead, events started moving really fast with no place for fillers or fooling around, and that waiting several years for the last arcs to be animated (or drawn) will be worth it, so don't give up on it, just put it aside and come back later. This is my original review from February 2019: I started watching this in 2008 and I was immediately hooked on it. I loved every bit of it - the pirate theme, the art style, the characters, the story. It has been pretty much amazing until episode 381, or in other words - the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Up to this point, the plot lines of the arcs were really fantastic, the art style was good, the fights were engaging, I just couldn't wait to see the next episode. But after that point, where they were entering Shabaody Archipelago, the show somehow lost its ""magic"" for me. I suddenly didn't care as much about what happens next and the excitement was diminishing. At the time I didn't take notice of that, but around the time of writing this in 2019, I finally realized that I no longer care about One Piece anymore - I did not care about the characters, about the fights, about how the story goes on, I just kept tuning in every Sunday morning to watch the new episode, because it had become a part of my routine for over 7-8 years. Now the art style has changed and at first I was on board with with, but later on I started noticing that the unique character of One Piece is gone with this new style. The colors of everything look somehow really bright and vibrant, and yet, at the same time - really washed out and dull, especially now in Whole Cake Island Arc. Where everything is so colorful and yet it looks dull and boring. The cannon fodder enemies that get knocked out by the dozens and once and don't even have names used to look somehow more unique and quirky, now they look really generic and similar. The same observation can be made about the main characters and even the supporting characters, main villains and supporting villains. Enemies like Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, Enel, Crocodile, etc. looked unique and interesting, but now enemies like Charlotte Family who never made an appearance before look very uninspired, it's like the author wanted to make some random, generic weird characters for the sake of making weird and quirky characters, but he failed at making them unique. Even the art style of the Straw Hats changed from being quirky and likable to overly-perfect, refined and with that - somehow boring and unlikable. The story arcs in the first part of the series (up to and including Thriller Bark) were interesting and unique, but now they feel boring, prolonged and utterly uninspired. Even Dressrosa, which people praise as a good arc, I found it to be very boring and a drag. Arcs like from when Luffy fought Alvida up to Loguetown have been a precious experience for me that I will never forget. When they crossed Reverse Mountain and entered the quirky otherworldly Grand Line, everything on the excitement scale got turned to 893593548935843. It has been the most epic part of the series (all the way up to episode 381). Character development has been insignificant and at first that was okay, because the show remained happy-go-lucky without being boring, but by episode 870, the character development hasn't been very significant and coupled with the other (and growing) negative aspects of the series, it is becoming very hard to watch. Overall, I think that the author Eiichiro Oda's inspiration for One Piece has diminished or has completely disappeared. He probably only draws the manga with the only goal to finish it and retire. His passion seems completely gone and what made the anime/manga/series interesting and exciting doesn't exist anymore. At this point I've lost all interest to continue watch the series and will be dropping them, I'm considering moving to the manga at this point only to see how it ends. In my opinion the show stops being good after episode 381 and my personal advise would be to stop watching there and move to the manga. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and continue to watch, but you will probably feel the same way like me after you catch up. EDIT: I tried reading the manga into Wano Arc and even that's boring and horrible. At this point I've completely dropped One Piece. I tried to rewatch it again from episode 1 to episode 381 with the original animation, but around episode 125 in Alabasta, I lost interest, not that it's bad, it's just not the same after seeing it.

"At first it seemed a little slow but finally things started to get interesting somewhere around ep. 50 maybe (the Loguetown Arc). I didn't even realize and I was hooked. Then, the pace started to get extremely slow. At the Dressrosa Arc (around ep. 600) I had to drop because, I don't exaggerate, it was so slow that it became painful to watch. It's a shame they ruined it like this, but I plan to continue with the manga, hoping for the best there. Apart from it's pacing everything is really good so I'd recommend giving it a chance. Maybe already start watching with the idea of having to switch to the manga halfway through it, so it won't be that disappointing that way.",9,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d0f569ca6,30
This is easily one of my favorite anime's with some of my favorite characters ever but I have some serious gripe with how I feel about the anime. I have literally stuck around since the beginning and I believe it has one of the stronger stories in anime. I feel it has been around so long without losing interest with people because the story and side arks lend to the main body and character evolution very well. However... the past I want to say 2-5 years the substance of the individual episodes have begun to feel like a dragon ball z power up episode. The introductions to each episode have become so long and boring you can skip the first 10 minutes of the episode and barely miss anything. With all that said when they eventually get to actually moving the story it has a great amount of silliness to emotional sadness that have made this a rather enjoyable show to watch.,9,Recommended,"Jul 13, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_94ebdc41b6,30
"After all the anime series I have watched since I was a kid, I was quite jumpy to browse any series that I wanted see based on the concept. Unfortunately, unlike any other people around me, I am not the kind of person who hopped on a hype train when it comes to the modern mainstream anime media. I am not driven to watch Spy X Family, Demon Slayer, or Oshi No KO, regardless of my nostalgic nerd or boomer nature. But I can agree that there some damn good anime series that are worth a watch such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Hunter X Hunter, Death Note & Vinland Saga. Let me start by saying that as who enjoys anime as usual, I already met the requirements for watching Dragon Ball Z & Naruto. But I didn't watch One Piece at all, up to the time Netflix arrived. I can tell from the core to my heart I honestly got hooked up from the first few episodes and it brings me up to have the energy as an anime enjoyer. I am currently at episode 500 of One Piece and what do I have to about this? There is a reason why I have Luffy profile on my account. I guarantee you that even though it has more than 1,000 episodes, IT WAS A DAMN GOOD EXPERIENCE! Not only One Piece offers so much good actions, insane worldbuilding, amazing soundtracks, surprisingly great comedy next to FMAB and storytelling. Eiichiro Oda has a purpose to create amazing valuable lessons about life to the viewers. Luffy: To become the Pirate King Zoro: To become the world's greatest swordsman Nami: To make a map of the world Usopp: To become a brave warrior of the sea Sanji: To find All Blue Chopper: To create medicines to cure all diseases Robin: To learn the true history of the world Franky: To create his dream ship Brooks: To reunite with his nakama Jinbei: To achieve world peace for humanity and Fishmen One Piece shows that dreams can shape destinies, foster camaraderie, and motivate people to overcome obstacles. It may sound really generic but that is also the main reason why Superman is iconic for deep reasons. ""Good. Dreams save us. Dreams lift us up and transform us into something better. And on my soul, I swear that until my dream of a world where dignity, honor and justice are the reality we all share, I'll never stop fighting. Ever."" - Superman If by any chance whether you do not want to watch this, you may find the treasure if you keep digging and digging. That's what makes this series so interesting.. It’s a long joyfully heart warming journey waiting to be sailed. This show is a fantastic investment for fans of the Shonen genre, especially if they have watched Naruto and Bleach, the other two members of the famous ""Big Three"" of Shonen anime.

"One Piece....an anime I was so hesitant to watch for a very very long time, but now here i am writing a review about it meaning ive successfully catchup with the series (actually i catchup with the series almost 3 years ago). One Piece, an anime with a diamond solid fanbase ever since 1999 and manage to keep growing until this day. Also among the shonen title with lowest new watcher but somehow also the lowest to have ""dropped"" rate, which mean most people cant escape One Piece rabbit hole. To put it simple, One Piece is addictive. Lets look at One Piece as a whole again. In term of originality, none.....not a single anime One Piece story concept is derived from and not a single anime take One Piece as inspiration from. In other word, One Piece is the most unique and original anime ever existed until this very day, yes since 1998. Cant find any other anime with the pirate concept or having the same character design as One Piece does etc. One Piece was simply built different. But believe me, that is not the strongest point for watching One Piece. The strongest point or reason why so many trapped in One Piece rabbit hole is simply because of its ""story"". Naruto might have cool flashy fight scenes, Dragon Ball have their Sci-Fi diverse universe, Bleach have their cool looking character design and power...but lets admit none of this is as important as a good story. And there's One Piece which suck at most of these parts but exceeding in story perspective. Some might say the story pace is so slow and some might say the story is too frickin long. That obviously mean they dont even attempt to watch One Piece yet. Little did they know that for us who catched up with the latest eps regret watching One Piece so fast and now worried that the series will end sooner. To show how addictive and great One Piece is, unlike other anime where fans are looking forward for their fav anime ending, One Piece fans in the other hand wish for another thousand episodes. Just to show how desperate fans dont want the series to end because it is so dang good. Gigguk once said : ""If you really like something, do you want it to end sooner or wish it to last like forever?""

"One Piece is a long-running anime series that follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew of pirates as they search for the ultimate treasure, One Piece. The show is known for its unique art style, which some viewers may find off-putting, but it’s also one of the things that makes it stand out from other anime series. The story is well-written and engaging, with plenty of action, humor, and heart. The characters are all well-developed and likable, and the voice acting is top-notch. One of the things that sets One Piece apart from other anime series is its world-building. The show takes place in a vast, fantastical world filled with all sorts of interesting creatures and characters. The world is richly detailed and feels like a living, breathing place. The show also has a great sense of humor, with plenty of funny moments that will have you laughing out loud. Overall, I think One Piece is a fantastic anime series that’s worth watching.

"One Piece is truly a masterpiece. The characters and the world they live in completely pulled me in. I’ve never been this excited watching an anime before. Luffy brings happiness wherever he goes and he really grew a lot during the timeskip. The world is incredibly vast and most islands have their own unique style, which makes every new place exciting to explore. Luffy and his crew perfectly represent true friendship. Their bond is the heart of the story and what makes it so special. The story is told at a slow pace but I actually think that works better for it. The fights are top-notch and always thrilling. The music is almost always great, and some songs especially hit hard during emotional moments. When something sad happens, I felt like I was part of the crew—I cried when they cried and laughed when they laughed. The only downside for me is the art style after the Wano arc—I didn’t like it very much. I hope it improves in the Elbaf arc or maybe it makes more sense to read the manga instead. Other than that, it’s definitely one of the best animes in the world. Trafalgar Law — Room Shambles",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c9e0fd1a24,30

If you want to get into an anime with amazing world building, mysteries, adventure, world politics that mirror our own, amazing lovable characters, then one piece is for you. As someone who grew up with The big three (Naruto, Bleach, One piece) one piece definitely comes up and beyond with how well rounded it is. And one particular thing i LOVE of it are how the FEMALE characters are written! Yes, unlike every other shonen where the girls are written to be the love interest and suddenly lose all the coolness they started off with, One piece women are humanised, have motivations and struggle and cry as ugly as their male crew. The diversity in op characters is also what makes it for everyone to enjoy. I CAN'T SAY MORE just watch and enjoy, it is something to watch at our own pace and no need to rush into it.

"The world-building. One of the things that keeps people from getting into One Piece is the length. The reason it’s that long is because Eiichiro Oda is the master of world-building. Each island the main cast travel to will introduce a new element to the story. However, whether it’s a new character, villain, government or piece of lore, Oda will take as much time as he needs to make sure that you understand before moving on to the next thing. If you watch episode 1 and then immediately watch the latest episode it would be like entering a completely different and confusing world. The characters. When thinking of memorable characters in anime, shows might have about one or two that you’ll remember long after finishing the series. 75% of One Piece’s enormous cast of characters won’t leave your memory as easily in the next foreseeable future. Like with the world-building, Oda takes his time to let you get to know the important characters so that when he goes back to the character you don’t go: ‘’fuck who’s that again?’’, you go: ‘’MY BOI IS BACK!!!’’. The anime. This has all been praising the story, which is prominent in both the anime and manga. But what are the pros and cons on watching the anime? The score. The music of One Piece is amazing, ‘nuf said. My favorite is Franky’s theme, give it a listen. The openings are also great, opening 1 is probably one of the most iconic openings (coming from someone with not as much non-mainstream experience so sorry if you think there are more iconic stuff). The shit. Let’s be real, the anime did go downhill after they stopped doing filler arcs and started stretching out episodes. When almost the entire episode is intro, recaps, and flashbacks then it’s honestly better to read the manga. Overall. As much as I love the One Piece anime with its soundtrack and iconic voice acting, I’d say read the manga and then watch the anime when you’ve finished a story arc. DO WATCH the anime but the manga is better in the end. If manga isn’t your thing then watch the anime. It goes downhill with dragging out episodes about halfway (keep in mind halfway is like way over 500 episodes in) but before that it’s amazing and the filler arcs are pretty okay although skippable.",7,Recommended,"Feb 4, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_98cff1cf70,30
"Let me start off by saying this; I am watching the dub, and it is not as bad as people make it out to be. It's a classic, and deserve all the love it gets. I have seen some people criticising the art, however, the art match the vibe of the rest of the anime. The anime has an ongoing story, that has a new plot every time, making it interesting all the time. The music can get a little repetitive, but it is good overall, as it is only played in low volumes, giving life to the scenes. Often, I watch animes, and the music doesn't fit the scenes 100%, however, it flows very natural in One Piece.

"One Piece, a sea of pros and cons. If you are thinking on starting One Piece, maybe this review can help you to taking a decision. To clearly expose my ideas I will structure the review by dividing it into two blocks. Pros: If there is something to spare in One Piece is epicity, giving unforgettable moments for a true fan of the series, but if there is something I love One Piece are the ""comebacks"". The moment in which a character that you had almost forgotten reappears unexpectedly (even after hundreds of chapters), whether or not it is very important for history, is simply magical. Another aspect to praise is humor, which is generally acceptable (although sometimes it can be sometimes repetitive, especially the one surrounding Sanji). In addition, the context of the story is well built, a world that must be explored little by little, with a system of powers (the three great factions) that are gradually explained as the story progresses. Last but not least, all the mysteries and riddles that arise and are not solved until the right time, leaving you an anxiety that encourages you to continue seeing it. In short, Echiiro Oda is a genius playing with the time. Cons: Here comes the ugly part of the review. The first, the filling, and I do not mean the chapters that do not follow the manga, but for example, endless battles that can last 3 or 4 chapters, and personally this has made me insufferable many on many occasions. Another reason why One Piece can irritate is the large number of characters that can simply be summed up in their ability and their phrases that they repeat constantly. These characters also tend to be quite flat and with a personality without any depth, which can sometimes be funny, but almost always makes them boring and predictables. NOTICE, the next paragraph could be considered spoiler! My last complaint is about the death of important characters. In One Piece the main characters (at least the mugiwaras) are like untouchables, and while a fight you, do not feel fear for them, because you know with certainty that they will not die. Now I am watching One Piece in streaks, it is an anime that requires a lot of time to see it and that sometimes I can't stop watching and sometimes I need to take a break. Despite its flaws, it remains a legendary shonen. Sorry if i made mistakes writing, english is not my native language.

One piece is something i like many other people said i could never watch because it is to long and i feel like i would be bored. But i still gave it a shot and started watching and boy am i glad i did. The art is not amazing the story is not the most special thing but the charachters and world building in this series is amazing. I have not seen this much charachter development and amazing backstories for every charchter before. The characters can be extremly annoying at times for me mostly the long gag of someone in the crew punching someone else in the crew for the stupidest shit but otherwise it is good. And it may be long and i may have skipped countless minutes in the span of the 911 episodes i have watched but when you finally get to the emotional and amazing parts it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth it.,10,Recommended,"Jan 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bc0c3e142f,30
"*A few spoilers ahead One piece is truly an energetic, exciting and binge-worthy anime. The animation has improved. I rewatched some episodes from the beginning and it interesting to see how sharp and clear the animation became. The characters have grown a lot throughout the years and the viewers are able to see their progression in their abilities and maturity. The original seven crew members are the best in terms of strength. Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are the strongest, then Franky, Robin and Chopper, and then Brook, Nami and Usopp (the weakest). Additionally, I feel the series was better in the beginning.The attack against CP9, the Alabasta Arc, the fight on Fishmans' Island, the fight against Gecko Moria and the Sky Island has brought the Strawhats closer, and then being separated for two years allowed for their development. Getting to know each character and their tragic pasts made the story much stronger. The return of many important characters won't list them here happens past 700. Luckily, we know that Jimbei may or may not be joining the Strawhat crew. he last two hundred episodes were a bit exhausting. It's the same thing over and over where Luffy fights a strong character and almost gets destroyed but then wins. My least favorite character would probably have to be Usopp. He provided no support or backup the whole time on Dressrosa and all he did was scream for backup. His character development hasn't many any strides since the first 300 episodes it feels like. There are some surprising elements that I feel made the story less tight recently. Usually the story is more tight. It was shocking that the whole crew didn't attack Big Mom's Island - instead Luffy took Nami, Brook and Chopper who aren't the strongest. Zoro should have been there along with Franky. Also, the fact that Sanji was related to the ""elite"" Vinsmoke family should have been made much more prominent at the beginning. I just feel that the story is a bit unraveling and isn't as concise as it used to be. Overall, I've fully enjoyed watching One Piece since middle school. It has stayed with me for a really long time and I still feel attached to the story. I was surprised to hear that the anime has no future ""end"" yet though I'm glad I can keep watching it for awhile now.",10,Recommended,"Nov 6, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9bb5ae77a9,30

I love the adventure that it has shown me, the characters, the depth, morals and the nature of life itself. I find it sad that other people have rated it so low but that may seem justifiable as it clearly began 24 years ago which appeals to the older generation. The new generation does not appreciate the old art, but to someone like me the old art was the present. It was one of the fresh arts of its form and I appreciated it as it was, as opposed to how the newer animes look today with impeccable CGI effects and what not.

And I can't believe people still defend it saying things like ""Hey the animation quality is good now so its fine"", ""The dragging on is better because it adds to the enjoyment"" or ""they have to do this as it will catch on with the manga"".

See wano has GREAT art but now kinda shitty animation however in contrast the pre-time skip era had GREAT animation but shitty art. And yes I am aware that none of this is oda's fault, it's toei's. See the manga art gets a 10/10 but toei is toei so they ruin it. Story: Ahh yes the single longest story I have every had the fortune to read/watch.

The imagination that it must have taken to make this story amazing and I love the diversity of the world and characters.

From alabsata to dressrosa to fishman island it has a variety of villains and yet Luffy and crew almost always win. I love this story! I will say however there was one arc I was not fond of and that was Punk Hazard. I found that arc boring and bland but aside from that one arc it is great. Characters: Well where do I start? There are thousands in this anime. There are just so many and they are all so different. Many of the side characters could each have their own manga or anime. A short(ish) one yes but their own. I think that alone says how great they are. If shanks were to have his own manga then I would be reading that thing so fast you'd think I was the flash. Or if ace or sabo or whitebread or maybe vivi.

"Lowering the MAL score is what I did when I was disappointed with Gear 5 Luffy, it's not that I hate the jokes in this anime series, but the joke was told at a critical moment which was not appropriate, it should have been seriously thrilling because that moment was the end of the Wano arc where the fight was the one you had been waiting for. after hundreds of episodes of this series and really this is a big mistake in my opinion. I like Sanji's joke about beautiful female characters, I like the joke where Zorro is always lost or blind, I like Luffy with his silly behavior and I like when Luffy is serious in fighting for his friends and ideals, it looks very cool and that's not me the discovery in the wano arc when gear 5 is active looks like a disgusting joke very disappointing. What I heard was that the author was inspired by the Tom and Jerry parody series, which was too forceful in inserting it just to get a fresher and new reaction, but actually killed one of the elements of the main character who always looks cool, like the main hero in many action stories with unfounded ridiculous behavior, which I think I don't know what's funny about the context, there are silly scenes like the Disney series in serious battles in the One Piece world?! Wano arc Wanting to achieve a plot twist, it actually became the worst plot twist in the time I have watched a lot of anime so far, my advice to the author is to better consider carefully the right moment where to place the right joke, where to be serious in battle or where the right moment is. sad scenes, a complex story will be created that is relevant from the beginning to the end of the story. If you force extreme thoughts into the framework of a story that has been mature for hundreds of episodes, it actually kills one of the important elements of the main character of the story, that is a futile action. So consider it more carefully, I don't hate authors who want to surprise their fans, but don't be so extreme that the fans become ignorant of your work. Honestly, when I watched the Gear 5 action, what I felt was not funny, not amazed, amazed, not epic or cool, but actually really disappointed, speechless and lazy about watching it in the future. So don't destroy fans' hopes just for a moment's extreme thought, it's easy to destroy a good work but it's difficult to build a work from scratch until it becomes a brilliantly good work. Update : In addition, it seems that I will lower my rating of this One Piece manga/anime again, because I am increasingly disappointed with the storyline where the supporting character, namely ""bonny"" in the egghead arc, easily becomes overpowered by imitating the power of gear 5 without any effort and training. This is very different from the main character Luffy who struggles to train and develop his strength step by step with all the obstacles and strong enemies.

"The prospect of watching through One Piece at this day and age is daunting, to say the least. Past 800 episodes at the time of writing, joining the One Piece hype train can seem impossible; however, if you even think you might be interested in the show, please pick it up. Allow me to explain why: The story of One Piece is an exploration of a world which has more layers than I hazard to comprehend. Shows which run even an eighth of the length of One Piece often make the mistake of presenting the world in a way where each new segment feels like it was made up for that arc, with hardly a thought beforehand. One Piece, however, unfolds its story and interlocking parts in ways which feel like a rug rolling out before the viewer. The flow of the story feels natural, and One Piece is notoriously good at playing the long game when it comes to characters, places, or information becoming relevant. It's a masterful exploration of how to build a world and then fill it with a story which adequately satisfies the grandiose and the intimate. (10/10) The art of One Piece, however, suffers greatly. As a TV anime--a TV anime which has aired practically weekly since 1999--it is subject to having to make do on a lower budget than preferable, leading to a lot of dicey background drawings or long-distance drawings. It has shining moments, but it is largely merely adequate. I can comfortably say that if you want to experience One Piece as a visually impressive art form, you are better off reading the manga, which is a masterclass in how to panel a visual story and, by comparison, puts the anime to shame. (6/10) I have a very soft spot in my heart for the sonic universe of One Piece. Whether the staff which helped put together the first effects and insert songs for the show knew they would be in this gig for the long hall, I do not know; I do know, however, that they have played the long game just as well as Eiichiro Oda himself. A tracklist for an episode today may have two songs introduced in Romance Dawn, two tracks introduced during a Grand Line arc, and two tracks introduced during a New World arc. With nearly two decades of material to recycle, One Piece could easily make do with what they already have; but Kouhei Tanaka and the sound design team are constantly working to outdo themselves and boost the anime to new heights by means of their labor. In episode 826, for example, an entirely new arrangement of the series' very first opening was brought in for an emotional moment, and it quite actually left me in tears. We may never have a long-running series again in our lifetime that will have the opportunity to use music and sound in the same way that One Piece has. Toei's team has taken an area that many overlook in long-running shows and turned it into an integral part of the world and storytelling of One Piece. (10/10) The characters of One Piece are without peer. Without exception, we see each and every main character at their best and their worst. It's easy to fall in love with an ensemble when you're with them for over 800 episodes, but the humanity and power behind the interactions of the Strawhat Pirates and the people they come in contact with are to die for. (10/10) One Piece is a romp which does anything and everything you could want in a show. You will laugh, cry, leap from your seat, and cheer for this series. On more than one occasion, I have gone back to rewatch an old arc once I had caught up to a current arc, and the wealth of callbacks in the show thoroughly rewards viewers who make sure they are up to date. (10/10) Though its art is lackluster, One Piece is practically the perfect battle shonen. If you like action, adventure, fantasy, or a good drama, One Piece has it all in spades.

"For me i find one piece to be a masterpiece, But looking at it critically i can't say that due to certain parts of the anime specifically dropping in animation, being dragged out. The world itself is always moving while our cast are which is a major plus over other long-running series which seems to have the out-side world frozen in place. One Piece is a living breading world which constantly has fans creating theories and going over every little detail with a fine-tooth comb, something the author clearly has planned for again and again and again. For an anime to have gone on this long and still have an interesting plot, great characters who have not only stayed true to who they are but have developed massive amounts is simply amazing writing.

"First Impression: Wayback early 2000’s when One Piece is televised in our local television. When I first saw One Piece what the f*ck with this character with unusual figure long legs, long arms, big head and what the hell is with the MC with expanding arms and legs and neck. Its so lame that nothing compare to naruto and ichigo. And the story is so simple the MC just wanted to be pirate king he doesnt want to save the world from big evil antagonist or something. I dropped it 5 min after watching it. 10 years later after keeping up with big shot anime like Naruto and Bleach I give it another shot. After watching it and reading the manga I have an awakening this anime is probably the greatest anime/ever. Story: Its amazing that its already more than a decade but the story doesn't degrade and just getting better. One Piece is like RPG games where the author is the player and we are the audience. Every chapter discover new area, he unlock new character, new power, new discovery and another new mystery. Every time we discover something new we unlock new achievement. It amaze me how he manage with the number of character and keeps their connection. With the massive story and numerous character development there are still many things unknown within the story that make the audience to want it more. Art: Very unique artstyle. When you see a drawing you can tell if its one piece reference due to its unique drawstyle that become its own trademark. Character: Its a wonder how the heck the author manage so many character with very unique characteristic and own backstory. Sound: Very memorable OP and ED. Enjoyment: I can rewatch it many times. You can feel different emotions while watching the series there are so many funny interactions, amazing fights, sad moments and epic introduction.

"Short Review This anime, without a doubt , deserve to be the big three anime along with Naruto and Bleach. For me, there is no such thing as ""this anime will get good at (blank) episodes."". My advice is don't watch this anime because of the story but rather for the characters. The drama between all the characters is what makes this anime more enjoyable than other anime. So, no wonder they made 900+ episodes just to make the audiences feel more understanding and more closer to the characters personality and feeling in every arc. And sometimes I wish that this anime will never reach to the ending.",9,Recommended,"Sep 22, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9f1e657079,31
"I hate trying to review one piece because if i reviewed it around episode 300-400 then I would probably give it a 9 while reviewing it when fully caught up (read the manga starting from episode 540ish) i'm struggling to give it a 7. The beginning of one piece sets up so many interesting things and has tons of great moments. The main cast is all likable and plenty of the side characters are great as well. The villains are usually pretty meh but most of the time everything else makes up for it. Also most of the time you're excited to see what some super hyped up villains will be like so you aren't even thinking about how bad some random insignificant villain they are currently fighting is. A lot of one piece relies on hype that has developed over many many episodes, but my main issue with the show is that it almost never lives up to that hype. So many long term mysteries end up being extremely disappointing or just boring as you begin to learn more. Cool villains or new abilities that are hinted at early on end up being predictable and yet again, boring. The more you learn about the world of one piece, the less interesting it gets. Anything you probably imagine when you first hear about some cool concept in the world is probably far better than what the concept ends up being like. Some things which you think will get an explanation end up just being never explained and any potential for a future explanation is shut down (such as some characters being able to just fly through the air practically by kicking through it for seemingly no reason). That is all probably my biggest problem with one piece, though there are 2 other big problems id also say exist. The second big problem with the show is that is rarely ever shows anyone dying that isnt a flashback. I'm not even talking about just major villains or main characters, I mean anyone at all. We rarely even see villains killing random people in the present, and we never see the main cast killing anyone even though they have never once said or even hinted at having an aversion to killing villains. Plenty of times they'll just leave a villain on the floor after beating them without even tying them up or anything, and then that villain will obviously get up from the floor and cause big problems either in the same arc or much later on. Plenty of times you'll think a minor side character will be dead and they'll even have this sentimental death scene, though then they'll just be inexplicably alive. This also makes it so that when someone really does die, the scene is sometimes ruined just because you don't believe they're actually dead. This problem is not nearly as noticeable early on and is again something that you really start to see being a big issue in the latter half of the series. The third and final big problem in one piece is that after the time skip happens the characters are all suddenly significantly worse. Luffy is originally portrayed as naive and impulsive but not legitimately stupid, though later on he seems to only get dumber and dumber. Other characters who were originally shown to be both cool and also funny, get turned into nothing but a gag character and they rarely get any good moments. Plenty of people just don't do things anymore and getting a significant character moment for any of the main crew is an extremely rare occurrence. Some characters might get an extension to their original backstory that is just worse in every way to what they originally had. The crew rarely has interesting interactions with each other anymore, and they never have any sort of conflict with each other despite them having had it before. TLDR; The first half of one piece is really good but as you learn more about the world it begins to seem more shallow than you likely originally thought, characters (including nameless background characters) don't die nearly as often as would logically make sense, and every character just gets worse about halfway into the series. If I just stopped watching/reading the show after about episode 400, it'd probably still be one of my favorite shows though after seeing what it turned into its hard to think of the good without thinking of the bad.",7,Recommended,"Dec 2, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b501a4f9b,31
"This is a must watch for any fan of anime. While the length can be off-putting, what you gain is worth it. Reasons to watch: . The world building is second to none and it truly feels like your part of it . The characters are all well developed and interesting with great backstories . The fight scenes are immense and brutal at times . The villains are all interesting with their own individual and pretty original backstories and reasons . I don't know if it's just me but i love the soundtrack and honestly think the pre-fight hype songs are the best out there . And the best bit it that is doesn't seem like it's ending anytime soon :) I honestly believe when this does finally end it will go down as one of the best animes/ mangas of all time. It's hard to believe there is still so much we don't know about the world and i cannot wait until all my questions are answered. Despite all this the first few arcs of One Piece can be quite boring and might not draw you in. However, after that i promise it gets more interesting and you won't be let down. Furthermore, it should be noted that the manga is widely considered better than the anime and if you up for the immense read i'd recommend reading it. Overall, despite all it's imperfections with some arcs, the charm of this anime is so amazing i cannot recommend it enough if you have the time.

"The first thing anyone who wants to watch One Piece should know(And I'm assuming most do) is that it is quite lengthy, currently clocking in at 905 episodes, with no present sign of stopping. (I'm currently at episode 800, myself) I think it does a fairly good job of fleshing out characters, giving them their own personal strengths and flaws - like the inability to have any sense of direction, even if they can physically see where they're trying to go; or an irrational obsession with treasure. I don't think it really skimps when it comes to the crew; there's several of them so I think it would be easy for some of them to fall to the wayside. One thing I enjoy the most about One Piece, is that it tends not to take itself overly serious. That's not to say there aren't tense moments, bits of drama, or whatnot, but it tends to skew a little in the direction of lighthearted. I think Luffy is a great main character, because he tends to act a bit goofy, but still has his own personal idea of what he wants to do as a pirate, and where he desires end up in the world. He's straightforward and doesn't waver on his target - he protects his crew and works to become King of the Pirates. I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out One Piece, to at least dedicate themselves to watching the first 'Saga' which ends with episode 61. It would give you a real feel for the story, and have time to suck you in or spit you out. I would warn anyone that wants to watch this; be wary of burning out watching it. I burned out at episode 791. I think if you're going to watch this, you should stop after every Saga or so, and watch something else, even if briefly, to let what you've seen process and give your brain a break.

"""Deep into the Grand Line"" Ohh One Piece how you continue to impress me with your mind blowing adventures, awesome fights, character development and overall remaining fresh from arc to arc. Honestly, and I mean truly One Piece might be my favorite anime of all time. However, I do love my cyberpunks anime but One Piece just never seems to bore me whenever I start watching again where I left off. Eiichiro Oda is a mastermind and I'm just amazed of how he brings these characters together and how he comes up with these amazing arcs! I love everything about One Piece and I understand why it's so successful. On the other hand, there are some people that might not agree with me and that's ok. However if you're new to One Piece, please don't get hung up on how long it is. Take your time with it. Because there's no way a story like this could've been done in 60-80 episodes. And frankly, there's no reason to. Watch this masterpiece of storytelling with a open mind and let Luffy and his Straw Hat Gang take on a adventure unlike any other.

"The thing most people criticize about One Piece is it´s length, for me I was able to watch all of One Piece during the lockdown in one month. While watching One Piece it got better and better until it became my favourite Anime and here is why: 1. Story 10/10 1.1 Story in general It is a shame that it seems like many people quite don´t understand the story of One Piece. For a show running for over 2 decades it is impressive that there are no plot holes, the story arcs all build on each other and give the viewer more and more insight into the world of One Piece. One Piece also, unlike other shonen, talks about the dark sites of society, it talks about slavery, racism, korruption and many more things you wont see in anywhere else. The story grew up with it´s viewers from a childish show for kids, to a show anyone can enjoy with everything from funny aspects to pure cruelty. 1.2 Storytelling/pacing This is one thing that is criticizable about One Piece, it has a very slow pacing, especially in the anime. But unlike other big shonen it has a very low amount of filler with 13% or so compared to almost 50% in Naruto and Bleach. But this low amount of filler comes at a cost, the anime, to prevent getting too close to the Manga, has to stretch it´s episodes which leads to a slow pacing. This slow pacing sometimes feels a bit boring but for most of the time the show is so exciting, that you are surprised when the episode is over because it felt that short. 2. Art 9/10 2.1 Artstyle The artstyle of One Piece is very unique, this is a bit uncommon at the beginning, but you will get used to it very fast. Man ypeople are arguing that the artstyle would be bad, but it just isn´t your generic Anime artstyle, it is something special. 2.2 Animation The quality of the animation varies from a 6/10 (f.e. at the beginning of the show) to a 10/10 (f.e. Wano Kuni). Sometimes One Piece has a very low quality in animation, this is a result of it´s weekly release. But for most of the time the animation quality is very good. There are also episodes where the animation quality is just godly (f.e. EP 983). All in all the animation quality is very good most of the time. 3. Sound 10/10 3.1 Opening/Ending One Piece has very good Openings and many of them are practically unskippable like f.e. Dreamin on, Hope,... In terms of Endings, one Piece hasn´t had any kind of Ending for quite a while. 3.2 Ost One Piece got some of the best OSTs I´ve ever heard (f.e. the very very very strongest, Overtaken,...) The quality of the sound is very high and fits perfectly into the scenes. 4. Character 10/10 4.1 Characters in general One Piece has a high amount of different characters and all of them are very likable and even have their own Backstory. For a show with so many different important characters it is amazing how nearly everyone is explained in a way that you keep them in mind, even if they only appear for a short period of time. 4.2 Character design All the characters in One Piece have their own unique design, there aren´t any characters who look similar (expect siblings of course). The different designs of all those characters are one thing that makes this show so good. I think in this show, there is at least one character the viewer can identify with, which leads to a very unique experience. 4.3 Character Developement Every main character has his/her own unique developement through the show without losing his/her traits he/she had in the beginning. As an example I will take God Usopp, he has undebatable one of the best character developements in all of Anime. In teh beginning he wasn´t brave at all and really annoyingand childish. But with the developement of the show he became braver and more grown up until he became a very likeable character. 4.4 Villains The Villains of One Piece all have their own unique Backstory and goals. You can understand why they are doing what they do and you can sympathise with them. But they still keep their evil traits. One thing One Piece does really well is the contrast of Pirates and Marines, you can´t tell which one is evil, because the Marines think they work for the good site, aswell as the Pirates/Revolutainaires. 5. Enjoyment 10/10 One Piece is something you wont experience another time, it is a great adventure you get closer with the characters and overall One Piece is a big Adventure noone should miss, it is unique in its own ways and for me it was the best experience in my life. 6.Overall 10/10 7. Summary One Piece is an Adventure on it´s own. Everyone should give it a try, because it´s clearly worth it. It has very unique characters, probably the best story you will find anywhere and the Sound is incredible. The Animation quality might vary from time to time, but it is always on an adequate level and on it´s peaks it .s just amazing. For People who consider watching this show right now, I suggest to watch at least until the End of Arlong Park (Ep 60)",10,Recommended,"Aug 3, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d3400a6e4,31
"(DISCLAIMER: I am going to be talking bad about One Piece. I know this is a sin and so if you must, avert your eyes.) Like many others, I really did not want to watch this for the longest time. I tend to be really skeptical of shows that everyone else likes mainly because I know how weird my tastes can be. Furthermore, starting this would seem like the biggest chore just because of the sheer amount of episodes. One Piece has been airing for over two decades with almost 1000 episodes and counting. I did not want to watch that many episodes. However, after giving this show a preliminary chance, I can say that One Piece was a somewhat enjoyable experience. The story is about pirates on a mission to seek a treasure that no one dares to venture for: the One Piece. It has a nice start to it and we see some small character development immediately from Luffy, the main character, as he searches for members to be in his pirate crew. The plot is relatively interesting and can keep you wondering what happens next. However, I was just left utterly disappointed in it regardless. Unfortunately, One Piece was far too over-hyped for me to the point where I developed astronomical, unreasonable expectations that it could not hope to meet. The art and animation is dated, obviously, but is still good at doing its job. I do like certain aspects of One Piece's artstyle and can see its charm and appeal. In a similar vein, the music also gives it charm. The use of the brass and strings in particular makes the soundtrack seem painfully late-1990s/early-2000s. I don’t have much else to say other than it works well with the scenes its in and that it makes watching the show that much more bearable. Some of the songs can be rather catchy and hard to get out of your head, so I suppose that is a positive. What's not a positive, however, is how godawful the pacing is. I recognise that this is a very popular complaint, but it is also not completely unfounded. You see it quite a lot with in One Piece with fights that are extended through ridiculously-long wide shots, background commentary by uninvolved characters, repeating shots (both in and out of recaps), and much more. Like a lot of longer shounen, this is extremely slow-paced and takes a while to introduce the main elements of its plot. Ask any One Piece fan and they will tell you something along the lines of, ""broooo i swear shit gets real by episode 400 bro come on just watch it."" Since I am more accustomed to the traditional 12-episode format of anime by now, I simply lack the patience to allow One Piece or any other longer anime to get good. If a 12-episode anime cannot pull me in within the first few episodes (sometimes just the first episode), I usually will not watch it. Similarly, I try to allow these longer shows at least 20 or so episodes in order to demonstrate their potential. One Piece somewhat failed at that for me. While it was by no means terrible, I do not believe I would have gotten as ""far"" as I am in the series if it were not for me being forced to watch a set number of episodes as the result of losing a bet. The characters of One Piece are obviously supposed to be pretty good. I mean, you have 900+ episodes with these guys; if they're all annoying, how the hell are you supposed to get through the show? I don't think One Piece disappoints too bad here except with the backstories. The main cast all have clearly-defined personality traits that each add to the experience in their own way. However, some of their backstories are rather uninteresting. This is more of a nitpick. Comparing the backstories of Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp—which are somewhat generic—to those of Nami and Sanji is like comparing your grandpa's 1987 MS-DOS Packard Bell to a NASA supercomputer. [MINOR SPOILERS] Both of their backstories are just so much more emotional and impactful than being killed by Down D. Stairs. [SPOILERS END] Perhaps I am too early in the series to say yet, but some characters clearly seem to be getting preferential treatment as far as backstories go. Another nitpick I have is the voice acting. Even to this moment, I cannot quite place what bothers me about the voice acting; only that it seems to be more prevalent in the male characters. In the Japanese version, at least, everyone seems to be talking with the ""ueeghh"" dialect and voice. Luffy's voice also isn't very good. For female characters, it seems like they could be classified with either deep, Nami, or lady-like. Like I said, this is more of a nitpick. One Piece is by no means a bad show. I just do not like it as much as other people do. If I'm ""not at the good part yet,"" I am sorry, but I feel that I have given it a fair chance. 52 episodes is more than reasonable. I might come back to One Piece sometime in the future given that I stopped at what seems like a crucial moment to begin/continue another arc, but for the time being, I leave it with a sideways thumb.",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 29, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3bd7e1d867,31
"The story is just literal perfection. It might sound like I'm over exaggerating but if you have the time to watch all the 900+ episodes , its definitely worth it. There are so many iconic characters and so many mysteries yet to be solved, so it never really gets boring. It is an 9/10 till it reaches close to 90 but after that it is a 11/10. The pacing isn't the best but when u have time to watch, it is almost negligible and I never had issues with it. This show is definitely a 10 for Enjoyment as it has right amount of Comdey, Action, Adventure. Some may complain about the animation , and I agree that it is bad in some parts but Toei has improved and its recent episodes are really good (about from 630-right now).

The first arcs of the story were slow and boring but enjoyable at the same time. The Marineford arc was very good. # CHARACTERS I found Luffy to be very energetic and seeking for adventure all the time without caring. Zoro is my favourite character. All members of straw hat crew are really exceptional from all the other pirate crews. All Yonkos are really powerful and interesting characters. I didn't find the marines to be interesting except Garp and the admirals. #STORY Story is very slow and intriguing. But I couldn't care much or less because this focuses more on new island adventures. The most enjoyable thing about this anime is it's world building . With every arc they go to new new island find new obscure creatures,characters,sceneries and this is the best thing which makes it so likeable.

"When I started the early episodes one One Piece, honestly it was a bit of a chore (it took me 150 episodes to actually see the genius taking route in the series). The only reason I kept going was because of my curiosity- there had to be something that made this behemoth of a series so successful and enabled it to go on for so damn long! And there definitely is, it's just a matter of whether the payoff is worth the extremely large investment, and whether you're willing to dive into an ongoing 750+ episode anime packed with not entirely original content that's already been done before, seen before and displayed with much more visually impressive and compact Shounen series like My Hero Academia, Nanatsu no Taizai & Magi. Personally, I'd say yes it most definitely is, but not for the reasons you'd initially want or suspect. Despite being a battle Shounen, the fights in One Piece are somewhat lacking in creativity and excitement. Which is ironic, because the world of the series is outrageous; many of the abilities outlandish and downright bizarre- I mean the protagonist is literally made of rubber. But good lord, do not watch this series if you want insane fights and balls to the walls action because the anime does not bring it to the table...aside from maybe a few times. The animation plays a huge part in that though and honestly I'm torn on how to rate it- because sure, there are a lot of lazy parts & tons of still frames during fights, but the color palette is bold and the character designs are just zaney as hell. Most notably the antagonists who somehow manage to look equal parts ridiculous and intimidating; the charactarizaton is nothing to scoff at. So I'll cut One Piece a little slack- it has been airing continuously for nearly my entire life span! However menacing that statement seems, it also means that One Piece has over 800 named characters, all playing some role in their respective arcs. With such a large cast, it's impossible to not find hundreds of them endearing! The only problem being that they almost always never get enough spotlight because the plot of One Piece NEVER STOPS MOVING. Love that new character? Don't get too attached because you probably won't see them again for another 300 episodes! The main characters go from island to island to island to island, which makes sense because they're an infamous pirate crew with a thirst for adventure...but sometimes the story needs to just take a breather, and so do I. So many things are going on with so many different characters in different places, that One Piece has developed this terrible habit of jumping about frequently, simultaneously making me want to both slow down & speed up the damn thing. Confusing, I know! Despite this, with so many arcs, sub-plots and backstories, there's a lot of good content to sink your teeth into. After all, One Piece isn't afraid to step away from its main characters unlike many other series of the same genre, and that's something I can't help but admire. We delve into the pasts, plans and aspirations of many side characters, as well as the history of the world of the series itself and whilst it may not always be done to a T, it does a damn good job trying. Nobody is irrelevant in the story however small their role might seem. The true appeal of One Piece doesn't come from action or cool fights, but rather from affairs happening in the background or the possibility of exciting future events. Really, watching One Piece is like watching somebody building a mansion from start to finish. It starts with such a basic concept, but before you know it you're tangled up in this huge web that never stops spinning, and One Piece is definitely one big web. The characters are treated much the same way- simple, yet suddenly not. Now, One Piece is not an introspective series by any stretch of the imagination (just look at Luffy, the representative and heart of the story) but it is not one where characters are good or evil, black or white. Yes, some are more good than others and some innately more cruel...but most of the characters do good and do bad, and I think that makes them instantly more likable and relatable. The development of the characters might not be great, but the fact that they're greatly flawed makes up for that most (not all) of the time. The world-building however, is consistently impressive. With it's own intricate political system and flourishing world, it's not difficult to find One Piece's setting astounding, and the amount of creative genius that's poured into it's fictituous world is nothing short of admirable. One Piece isn't always great- some arcs flop, some go on too long, character gimmicks can be grating and half the main cast disappear for episodes on end, but when the series shines, it shines bright. And to me, a series is pretty damn magical when you can roll with its flaws and still love the hell out of it. One Piece is a journey of numerous ups and downs where you can't have the good without the bad; individual taste dictates whether it's worth the investment.",9,Recommended,"May 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f97682f218,32
"No spoilers. Anything which I write won't do this Anime justice. No words can describe the journey which you'll take with Luffy and his crew. One Piece is incredibly well written, doing an excellent job of being entertaining, comical, heart warming and much more. The Arcs can be emotional rollercoasters with such suspense that you'll indulge so much without realising the birds are tweeting outside and its 5am. The fight scenes and large battle scenes are great eye candy and continue to get even more incredible throughout the journey. Overall I highly recommend One Piece if you enjoy pirates, superheros / powers, protagonists who level up / surpass their limits and well written captivating stories.",10,Recommended,"May 30, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6b74ffe314,32
"I watched some of this when I was younger on cartoon network or something and I'd always disliked it. Now I can see the humor and I can never find pirate anime or manga. I adore pirates and the way One Piece portrays pirates is fun. They have the bad, the plan evil, but most of all it has friendships with in the crew. I think it's very enjoyable even if the art is, well down right bad is what I use to think. However now I can see that it's a kind of unique way to show the characters.

"As someone that is reviewing one piece that actually is caught up with the anime I'll give a full in depth review of it... It's ok, first half before time skip has a few good arcs, after time skip most of the arcs are good. More specifically some of the best arcs in the first half I can think of are Impel down, Sambodey, and Marine Ford. The arc that is bad after time skip is just fishman island which wasn't even too bad tbh, but still way worse than all the other arcs after time skip. Most of the characters in one piece are very good near the end of where the anime is right now, because they have gone through tremendous character development and have strengthened their skills so much which is what I really appreciate when I watch an anime. At the beginning of one piece the jokes and animation can sometimes be outdated and the characters for me at the beginning where hard to get attached to. Another big problem with one piece is the obvious one which is the pacing. The pacing wasn't too much of an issue for me personally because I had a lot of free time that I could kill just watching this series for days straight (sometimes 100 episodes in one day), but for others this is a real and reasonable drawback to not watch this anime. The solution to this problem is to either use the sight one pace or to just read the manga. One piece in Wano has some of the most legendary animation and fight scenes and some of the character backstories and literally tear jerking and the show is just absolutely awesome lmao. Overall one piece is a great show or manga that I think everyone should at least try to get into and watch the first 400 episodes before it gets to be the best anime of all time (not really but it's up there), and I hope you enjoyed reading my scuffed review.",9,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d8afb9a509,32
"Like every show you cannot be upset by watching a insignificant piece of this series by watching only ten episodes and say ""oh its too many episodes"" to understand a series you have to pass through firsts arcs at least, my personal opinion is i enjoyed first 3 arcs but then i was bored and think like it was getting repetitive and nothing funny but then i take my time to go still so maybe i can find something to be attracted sort of. So finally i could apreciate the whole anime by starting 4th arc, isnt a bad anime a all, just is hard to start liking after watching firsts arc. Im getting too nostalgic with it lol.

"I have come to love this anime its like a emotion roller coaster ...with every arc it gets interesting (although at first I didn't want to watch because of its length but later my friends asked me to watch this anime upto marineford arc if then I didn't like then they said to drop it.. but I got addicted to this anime from enies lobby arc 😅 itself...) Thank you Eiichiro Oda for writing such a great story..!!! Story (10/10) The world of one piece is big hence the story pacing is slow but accurate for the story building, later in the episodes I realized how important were the backstories and how dots are connected.. overall story is very good... it sometimes I can connect to reality... Character (10/10) Every character plays an important part in the one piece world, with one character missing from the world can cause big change... the character development with every arc is worth watching of the people around luffy... and how he influences every characters..:) though every character gets a chance to shine.. Art (9/10) & Sound (10/10) Art is not much good before red line... but after red line it improved and now its. becomes a masterpiece (especially in Wano arc) Sound is good from the beginning from op, bgm or ending everything. is good and some becomes addictive Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed everything though pacing is really slow but after arlong arc I stated to liked it...and then after enies lobby arc I come to loved it...and there's no turning back...

"One Piece. One of the most well-acclaimed pieces of Fiction in history, Topping the manga charts and becoming the longest-running shonen anime, apart of the Big 3, its hard to not have some curiosity why this series is so popular. During the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, I began to watch One Piece, I realized its length, but something about pirates always interested me, so I decided to watch it over the span of 4-5 months, and let me tell you, when I am glad I did. Story 10/10- One Piece has an absolute stellar story. It is simple, Luffy wants to become King of the Pirates. Well, it isn't quite that simple Luffy is like a small fish in a huge sea (no pun intended). His goal is nothing short of near-impossible but that won't stop our favorite stretchy pirate MC from achieving this by any means possible. Luffy and his crew will not stop until they each have reached their goals and will find the mythical treasure left by Roger himself. The story is broken into individual arcs and while pacing may be an issue in some, it cannot simply takeaway from the greatness this story presents us. There is a quote from an anime that represents One Piece perfectly for me. ""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" - Ging Freecs (HxH) This highlights that while attaining Luffy and our crew's goals, the adventure they are having is what is strengthening them as a character and as a human/reindeer hehe. Yes we want to find the One Piece, but many of us also do not want the story to end. Art 9/10- Many people will not watch One Piece due to its low quality from being animated in the late 90s. But the art style is something that makes One Piece stick out from its competitions much like JoJos. The animation is not the greatest at first, but it's simplicity/cartoonish vibe is something that paints our story so well and we have to give credit to Toei for making it so close to the manga in terms of Art. One Piece art is something that will grow on you, just like me and many other fans Sound 9/10- One Piece has a great soundtrack and great voice acting. The soundtrack fits perfectly whether that be a sad moment in the show (get your tissues ready... Not for Nami or Robin you pervert) but for the sad OSTs or the badass ""Overtaken"" when our boy Luffy is ready to kick some ass. Character 10/10- One Piece has the best cast of characters I have ever seen in anime. With such a heavy amount of characters, Oda make sure not one is forgotten. Each character added especially the straw hats serves a purpose for the story and will not be forgotten about down the line. The Straw Hats remain the best team in anime, simply due to the fact that each one is well-written and isn't just ""there"" they have their own ambitions and goals that compliment Luffy perfectly as well as themselves. One Piece has antagonists, who we as viewers, can usually empathize with and actually understand what their motives and goals are in a complex but also simplistic way. Enjoyment 10/10- One Piece is very enjoyable, it has a perfect amount of exposition and fighting, and you never once have the feeling of, this show isn't going anywhere. Some parts may be slower than others, but once you watch, you will realize how these slow moments developed our characters and the story in its entirety. One Piece you will enjoy all the way from East Blue to Wano Kuni. Overall 10/10",10,Recommended,"Jan 12, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c3c83ae4e6,32
"The anime have finally reached 1000 episodes but the plot is still pretty solid and even though it is still expanding, they are all connected. So let's move on, I agree that the animations was not that good but hey, I didn't watched this anime because of the animations. If you're not used to watching animes with old school animations, you might find it hard to start watching it. I bet it is much better if you'll get used to watching old school animes before watching the modern. As I said in the first part, the plot is masterpiece and it is super hard for any mangakas to pull that off since it is a pretty long anime. If you'll watch the anime carefully, you'll understand that the plot was not just something that came from nowhere, as if it felt like Oda actually thought about the whole story before even starting the manga. I've seen lots of theories about the plot of One Piece. It is actually commendable that most of those theories are wrong, since Oda made the plot as if it is almost unpredictable. You'll probably need to use lots of your brain cells just to predict one important scene in the story. I really like how Oda construct the plot. The more I watch the more mysteries will show up and more of those mysteries will be solved. There are lots of cliffhangers especially in this current wano arc. This anime won't run out of mysteries and you will definitely crave for answers. For the characters, I'll say that its been a long journey and they've grown stronger than before. I like the developments of each straw hat member, they've literally improved than the first time they were introduced. Their back stories are all interesting and some are still a mystery. I've already watched more animes but this anime was the most unforgettable for me. I easily forgot the name of the characters and the details in other animes but this one is clearly different. It is pretty long so it should be easy to forget but I think it is because we're talking about One Piece that's why. Please don't say that the anime was bad if you haven't watched all of it's currently existing episodes. Also, make sure that you're paying attention when you're watching it or else you won't understand most of it.",10,Recommended,"Nov 26, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9c46411b69,32
"you have all heard of the same praises so i wont talk about it but ill give you all the negatives. -the repesentaton of the woman and lgbtq community is not that good showing the gays as gross hairy men covered in hair and wairing dresses and woman all looking the same. although the author has been better with lgbt representation recently its still very far around ep 900. the woman have not gotten any improvment as everybody is fat and ugly or tits on a toothpick. the female characters dont get a lot of shine either dispite how strong they are. -the arcs in one piece are incredibly hit or miss which is sad. thriller bark was very slow and none of the fights were fun and there was nothing to add to the story and the main villian of the arc is pretty lame too. fishman island was hyped up and was pretty fun but its extremely forgettable for me, i cant remember any of the villian names in that arc and its sad that its the first episode after the time skip. skypia was a nice arc but the main problem was pacing as it was painfuly slow and if their powers were never explained as haki later on it would be a very bad arc in my opinion. im not going to talk about long ring ring long land just skip it. -timeskip battles seem to be alot dummed down and just summed up as whoeveres haki is stronger wins and that just how it is. pre time skip the fights were way more amusing making use of suuroundings and devil fruits abilities to the most potential. haki is not a very good powersytem but rewards us with very flashy fights and seems also mandatory to deal wit some opponents. i wish we could have a better power system and that pre time skip battles came back but we will never get that -the pacing is horrific downright torture and i dont blame people for not watching it. its also makes unlikeable arcs even worse and in my example punk hazard was not a very good arc and lasted way to many episodes. dressrosa was a great arc but 118 episodes was torture and was hard to watch. do yourself a favor and if your not fully invested at arlong park or alabasta you should drop it because then youll never like it and youll waste a lot if time -one piece is very repetitive and usually goes along the lines of 1)land on island and marvel in its wonder 2) find some dirty secrets and introduce the villans. step 2 also takes way to long 3) flashback to give the battles weight and add to the story 4) defeat the bad guys and liberate the land and then move to the next island",9,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_22de413d2c,32
"I know many people complain about the lenght of the anime, but in my opinion that's part of the experience. One Piece is already a reeeeeally long anime (977 episodes up until today), adaptating the also reeeeeally long manga of the same name (1015 chapters up until today). It may seem as a really tedious anime to watch at the beggining, but once you start, it feels as though you can't quit watching it anymore, and that's not an issue whatsoever. Let's analyse it's traits: Story: 10/10 Eiichiro Oda has indeed the knowledge on how to build a story on which the world where it's set actually feels alive. The story arcs (not every story arc, but most of them) are meticulously made so the story as a whole has a meaning. For example, all of the arcs of the second half of the anime, even though they're set on completely different places and with different characters and objectives, they all are made for a final objective, which I won't say, but that final objective is a vital point for the realisation of every crew member's dream, which would be the final final objective. Apart from that, the world on which the story is set evolves with every arc, generating new obstacles for the Straw Hat's crew and even changing the whole story setting. It feels as every character shown has had, has or will have repercussion on the story, which is quite unusual among other animes. Art: 7/10 Let's see, Toei doesn't do a bad job, but it still isn't a great job. Let me explain myself. The anime's art is quite loyal to the manga's but... there's something that feels off sometimes. The animation has changed a lot these 20 years, but if you ask me, the animation is generally quite monotonous. The actual animation (Wano's arc's) is really cool imo. Sound: 7/10 Well, the openings are VERY good, the endings are OK but the sound effects are just... dull. They've been the same since 1999 and little changes have been made. But I'm saying this while getting critical, when I'm watching an episode, I don't pay attention at the dullness of the sound effects at all. Character: 10/10 As I said back at the story review, every character (with a name of course, not faceless background characters/marine soldiers) is unique and feels as if it has had, has or will have repercussion on the story. It doesn't matter if it is a character that has only appeared once in the whole anime, that character is most likely to appear and do something somewhere in the future. The Straw Hat's crew members are completely different from each other, each one with different dreams and personalities. And despite that, they all blend together well, making a really enjoyable cast. That's what makes One Piece's character development a model for other animes. Enjoyment: 10/10 I have to admit that there are parts more boring and tedious than other ones, but the enjoyment is still outstanding. In most of the episodes,(especially on the last 200), I have been thrilled to know what was going to happen on the next chapter by watching the next chapter's preview. Also, the story right now is reaching a really important climax and lots of things that were unknown in the past have been now revealed, making most of the fans (also me) really excited about how the story will continue until its end. Overall: 10/10 Despite the anime adaptation's mistakes, the story and everything else is the same as the manga's, which in my opinion, is a god tier work of art, so for me it's a blunt 10 out of 10. I'd reccomend reading the manga if the person I'm reccomending this to wants to read it in a hurry, but if that's not the case, I'd reccomend the anime if that person has enough patience and time. Personally, I've watched the anime instead of reading the manga because I think that experiencing One Piece in a longer, audiovisual format, makes me appreciate more a well done story, since I have the tendency of reading mangas in a hurry and not enjoying it as well as I should be enjoying it. From now on, the plot will be getting more and more interesting and I'm really excited on how it is going to develop. I hope you consider someday giving One Piece a try and see by yourselves what value does this anime have for you.",10,Recommended,"Jun 12, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8f10dde898,32

"If someone asked me , ""is One Piece good?"" I would not be able to give them an answer. The time I've invested into this series is absurd. And if I were to say ""Yes , OP is good"" , it might be cope to not feel like I've wasted my life. But I find myself unable to say no because there were moments where I also felt , ""Hey , this might be the best show of all time."" Eiichiro Oda masterfully weaves mature themes like moral pluralism, corruption, anarchy, war, and slavery into the narrative, making them accessible even to VERY YOUNG audiences. Regardless whether they could be bullshit connections or not, the series boasts an unparalleled depth of worldbuilding and details hint at events and developments that may be hundreds of episodes in the future. Given the sheer volume of episodes , this level of intricacy should be expected. There is just one problem. Episodes have had frequent issues with pacing. This is not a problem when you've just started One Piece or are in the process of binging the show. When you catch up , thats when you begin the edging process. I caught up at episode 787 , where I had to begin painfully waiting for the Whole Cake Arc to air one episode at a time with little plot progression. I was 12. I had to wait 2 or 3 years for that to complete. Same thing for Wano. Waiting week after week for countless dragged out scenes. It constantly caused me to doubt the overall quality. Then every so often sprinkled in between, there are masterfully done moments which reignite that passion for One Piece, peaks of enjoyment that have never been touched by any other series I've watched, only to realise yet again that I'll need to wait a week for the next episode which might be the same shit they've been feeding me straight from a donkey's anus or it might be the nectar of the gods pouring out of Aphrodite's breasts. But the recent episodes have truly taken a step towards cinematic excellence, which has made the slower moments more enjoyable. Greater animation, so many details from previous worldbuilding coming into play, and the deeper plots slowly being unveiled. It somehow still feels like the show is reaching new heights step by step, and I can only pray this will continue.",8,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 20, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_173124975b,32

The animation looks so cheap, it´s really ugly. worse than that is teh pacing though. 5 minutes of reading is stretched into 2 episodes. It get´s tiresome quickly. On top of that I don´t like the changes they made to make it more kids friendly. i don´t want to spoil anything but I´m sure you have already seen the lists discussing the changes made in the show.

"For starters, I enjoyed the series. I do have my issues with it as well, that might be a ""RED-LINE"" for some. However, there is a lot of good this series does have. POSITIVES: - Good for passively watching while completing other tasks. - The world's lore is so expansive that you can get yourself lost in the endless theory videos. - It's light-hearted, fairly innocent (with exception of fan-service), has interesting fights. NEGATIVES: - The pacing of the show can make it feel like a slog if you're binging it. - The main characters, although they have their arcs, don't change all to much from when they're first introduced (aside from power levels). - Death SCENES feel inconsequential 99% of the time, and when a REAL death scene happens it's hard to be present for it because you just expect the character to cheat death, because reasons. - We don't need everyone's facial reaction to everything momentus that happens. - Some of the villains feel flat upon meeting them, and some are. But that bound to happen with so many villains. One inexcusable flat character is Smoker.. So much potential wasted. NEUTRALS: - There's a swap in power-systems around 250~ish episodes in, from Devil-Fruit to Haki. -- Devil Fruit Era: The fights are more based around coming up with interesting solutions to face the oppositions devil fruit powers. Or vice versa. You can't hurt Rubber Man with a Hammer, so use a sword. -- Haki Era: The fights are more based around the users level of Haki. Solutions that worked last arc now don't work, because your haki is too weak. With a Haki infused hammer, you can hurt the Rubber Man. Making devil fruit powers more of a neat quirk than a useful tool. However, this change can be seen for the better, as Rubber Powers started to feel a bit stale. The Gear system (for Luffy) to level up his Rubber-i-ness was really cool in the Enis Lobby arc. But the rest of the crew needed something to explain their power-ups, to keep up with power-creep. All in all, I'd recommend this anime as I would recommend the use of Audible. Do it alongside something else.

"One piece is a masterpiece, the characters are great, even the most non important character has a good history, and development, the world of One Piece is incredible, it’s so interesting and fascinating, one or other arc isn’t that good, but it’s worth watching for sure. Watch at least to Arlong park, because after that you can’t stop watching. In the beginning I was watching 1 episode per day, after few episodes I was watching mora than 10 episodes per day. The drama is also very good, I can’t count in hands how many times I cried watching One piece.",10,Recommended,"Oct 7, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4053f50577,32
"This anime in a summary, is based. The charters are based with so many diverse personalities and abilities. The writer somehow manages to create this sort of worldly feeling whenever you watch or read the show. To the point where you feel like the story isn't focusing on our main crew, But the world as a whole. The amazing sound design brings the story to life with it's iconic sound track and sound effects. I started this show on a whim and 600 episodes later I am amazed by the pure scale of this show and how it never seems to get too stale. Almost everything that happens comes back in a later scene in a sense where it keep you on your toes in excitement. Some people find the art style ugly or unappealing but I don't think this show would be as fun and enjoyable to watch without it. I absolutely adore the devil fruit and eventually haki system and how well flourished it is to the point where even the haki sound effect is well recognized. The only real complaint I could make is the bad pacing in the anime, but the bad pacing almost makes it endearing and even more fun to watch.

"When I started watching, people told me ""it takes a while to like it,"" so I asked different people ""like how long?"" and they told me about 50, 70, or 100 episodes. When I got to 30, I was discouraged. At 60, I took a break and came back much later. I watched it little by little until I got to 175, when I gave up. Is it bad? No, but I'd say that, at least, the older episodes are a matter of taste. I no longer have the patience for the directing style and pacing of the time (remembering that it began being adapted in 1999), so maybe if I could get to the more recent ones, I would like it. But since I couldn't stand it, I didn't enjoy it. It's not MY taste. The stories didn't interest me, I didn't grow attached to any of the characters, nor did I care about their dilemmas, which made it difficult to care about what happened to them. ""Ah, but Oda is a genius at creating narrative,"" okay, but that's not enough to keep me watching when I can't even engage with what's presented to me. I'll try to watch it again when the remake comes out; maybe I'll be able to catch up on the more recent ones that way.

"SPOILER FREE! This show is a multi generational masterpiece. One piece has so many fantastic elements and is an incredible show that many fans turn away from because of the PACING. I want to embark on why you should watch this show, even with that aspect, and how to get around the way the show drags its own feet (read my part on pacing). It is truly worth watching if you are a patient type of person, because it is one of the most incredible shows I have watched. It stands alone to the hundreds of anime I have seen, and will forever be in its own class. That’s how culturally impactful it is to animation. CHARACTERS : As someone who is caught up, one thing that I was constantly impressed by was the diversity of the characters and design. The world building in the series creates an environment for many interesting characters and out of world designs. Even with the so called occasional “villain of the week” characters, I never got bored. One thing I really love about one piece is the moral reality about the characters. Most shows don’t touch on the concepts of villain redemption, or that a character can change for the better. One piece thoroughly is aware of the motives of their characters. Some redeem themselves, some remain questionable, and some straight up aren’t redeemable. Some characters are just true jerks. But each character was written with thought, and it makes them feel like real people with real intentions. ANIMATION: This show is Toei Animations prodigy and love child. When I began watching it last year I quite literally saw the animation progress from the style of the 90s through the current times. That in itself was fascinating for me because you quite literally see the development of the eras of animation through the course of the show. BUT, please don’t turn away if you are thinking the older animation can’t stand to its today. Like I said, this is the studios lovechild. The animation at the beginning is fluid and even nostalgic in a way. It has its own charm. It’s still captivating and a lot of viewers even prefer the older animation. I initially turned away because I didn’t think I would enjoy watching outdated animation but I was wrong time and time again. And despite it all the show never loses its true essence, the soul of the series is always there. PACING : (the elephant in the room) One criticism of the show is that Toei takes arcs from the manga and drags them out SO long. And I’m not going to lie, they do. I almost dropped the show at points despite how good it is because it takes them episodes at points to do what the manga does in 2-3 pages. This was because at some point Toei was releasing on a weekly basis and longer run time meant more income, hence so much beating around the bush. Of course it still releases the same way, but this was a very important cash point before streaming services, and there used to not be a digital forum to complain about the pacing so they got away with it for a while. Believe it or not the show was airing decades before you could watch it on Crunchyroll. Despite this, the show is only 10% filler. Most of the time what they are stretching out is the canon. There is a way to get around this. A very dedicated team ended up creating a series called “One Pace”. They essentially fix this problem while delicately cutting out all the overstretching while not taking out anything plot wise. They basically fixed Toei’s pacing problem, since it’s so hard to watch the show otherwise. You can access this multiple ways if you have a watching device and it’s free. That at times was the only way I got through the bad pacing of the show. They dedicated and still are dedicating years to this and I would suggest any new watchers go that route. You can actually enjoy the show that way for what it’s meant to be without thinking, “get to the point!” The pacing in the more current years is better because viewers have a larger voice now that streaming is the main. Nobody wants to spend time watching them show the same thing for five episodes so Toei seems to have fixed this problem. It drags occasionally but it’s way more digestible than it used to be. Thank the internet! PLOT: The plot of the show is simple and that’s what makes the show so intriguing. What gives the show life is what the simple plot line allows to set up for, which is the incredible world building and interesting characters and dynamics. There are some arcs you may favor and may not. I would honestly say, if there is an arc in the show you are hating and you wish you could get past it to the next one, you could do it unscathed. I wasn’t crazy about the Thriller Bark or Fishman Island arc and I settled on watching a synopsis halfway through them because I was more interested in the next part of the story. Some arcs are weaker than others. But it’s up to each viewer’s opinion. Don’t let the bad arcs take away from the good. Arabasta, Water 7, Dressrosa, Sabody, Marineford, Whole Cake, and Wano are incredible. FILLER and LENGTH: Just skip the filler. It mostly takes away from the show and I found them to be some of the worst arcs in the series. This is occasionally not the case but if you’re pressed for time please don’t worry about the filler. There is SO MUCH show and so much time in the average day. Take that for what you will. The length of the show is more than a mouthful (or eyeful?) The show is REALLY long. Even so I think it’s worth the watch guaranteed you are smart about getting past that pacing. If you are the type of person that has nothing to watch because you’ve already seen the majority of the shows out there this will keep you from being viewer hungry for a while. It took me 6-7 months to get caught up from the beginning, but I didn’t feel resentful for having to watch so much. It’s a great time killer and the show is refreshing and easy to follow so you can pick it up and put it down without getting bogged down by all the plot you may have forgotten. If you have time, watch this show. It is a true Classic and had many cultural influences on the anime industry. It is a fun and even thrilling watch a lot of the time, and most viewers wonder why they waited so long. It took me years to pick it up because of how dauntingly long it is, but once I did I regretted not picking it up sooner!",10,Recommended,"May 6, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6ef428e0fe,32
"No matter how good the first episodes are - DON'T WATCH IT. The first 500 episodes are good, a handful of them are great, but unfortunately, the quality of this show went south afterward. First, the show’s story progression became even slower than it was because of the manga. As a result, every episode now includes the full opening played at the beginning and then a 2-3 minutes recap of the last episodes. Not only that, but most of the “new” episodes have an insufficient amount of actual plot progression and more annoying fillers and flashbacks of what we have seen only one or two episodes ago as if we were too stupid to understand and connect the dots without the flashbacks. Second, the art became dull. I’m not an expert, but the newer episodes feel cheap. Everything from the world to the characters is less detailed and the colors are boring. Besides that, I don’t like what they have done with the female character’s breasts - They’re too big to my taste and compared to their size before they changed the art style. The characters are boring, cheesy cliches. The new characters are all the same, they have nothing meaningful to add besides bad written and over-sentimental lines that (supposedly) should lead to some cheesy flashbacks that make the main character say something cringy about the heart of the cards... oh oops, wrong show. Anyway, maybe if the episodes were released more often than they do, then it could be more emotional, but even then these scenes are rather uncomfortably cheesy/awkward to watch. You might assume that 500 decent episodes are a good reason to at least start it, but what is the point of starting something that you most likely won’t even finish? Even if it’s not a good enough reason for you, and you believe you might like the new episodes, consider this: It took them about 2 years to complete each of the two most recent arcs (Dressora and Cake Island), and the current arc is far from being the last one. Now, considering that only few new people will pick one piece, and old fans are leaving the Fanclub, there are only three possible outcomes: Either you will have to spend the next 10 years waiting for the final episode, or the anime’s budget will become even smaller and the quality will get worse, or show will get canceled. Even if you consider the journey more important than the destination, this journey has all the chances to become bad and longer than your love for anime.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_aa3dd29624,32
"Best thing I ever watch/read/seen in my life. And trust me I've seen a lot from Indian cinema to Hollywood, but there's nothing as legendary as One Piece. It is the most special thing in my life. Obviously, the manga is on a whole new level, but the anime adaptation of the greatest comic book of all time does justice to the manga. Only one reason is enough to say that the anime does justice to the manga and it is the Japanese voice cast. They give life to the characters. Art: Oda's art, duh. But the animation gets a little mediocre after time skip but that shouldn't worry you if you're a One Piece. 9/10 Story: The greatest story mankind has ever come up with. 10/10 Sound: Good choice and one of the most iconic Shonen music + the voice cast. 10/10 Character: Every character is close to my heart, every One Piece fan at this situation should be biased, cause they are the greatest fictional characters. 10/10 Enjoyment: The greatest form of entertainment a living creature can ever witness.

"I once Loved One Piece, It used to be great... YEARS ago and I'll play Morpheus here before I start the review. If you want to stay in the illusion that One Piece is the best of greatest animes of all times, let it go, dont read my review. If you wanna know why the series is saturated already, keep reading at your own risk, you have been warned: 1- No ONE. EVER. DIES. - It doesn't matter what is happening, if it is a bullet, cannon ball, knife, sword, atomic bomb, war, no one in the series ever dies, Oda only gives you the illusion that the character died to show moments later that everyone is ok. 2- Flashback Kills - This one is contraditory to my first argument, but to dont say that oda never kills, he'll enjoy doing that in flashbacks, in the actual arc be relaxed, no one will die, but in flashbacks? be sure that someone will die. 3- ""Hey, Ace and White Beard Died"" - Yes my Friend, and he made an entire arc for that to happen and who else died without being in a flashback, entire wars and civil wars happened, where EVERYONE got just bruises and scars... 4- Civil Wars : EVERY ISLAND, EVERY SINGLE INSLAND, they face a civil war, one way or another, the population of the island fight, it doesnt matter the reason, they'll just fight. 5- Random Mystery to be solved: Oda tends to throw mysteries around the series, just to solve them 100 chapters later, but it is not like lost, he doesnt give you hints about it, he just throw the mystery, and throw what it means, simple as that, but if you wanna know, keep watching for the next 2 years. 6- Moar Boobs: By the past years, the female boobs is just increasing, while his creativity is diminishing. He is basically throwing random fan-service to keep audience. 7- Hidden Royal Familly Seeking Something: Somehow the Crew will reach an island, and if that island have a monarchy, be sure that the king is overthrown and they will meet the princess and the king in coincidencial circunstances. 8- Secret Organizations: I lost the count how many shady characters and secret organizations appeared, they are always the all powerfull, just to appear another one more all powerfull than before. 9- Epic Moments: At the end of each arc, Oda tends to do something unexpected, and THAT where is his MASTER TRAP is, every arc, usually ends with luffy or someone from the crew doing something amazing or really unexpected, remember when I said about Ace and White Beard Death? That is Shocking, happened at the end of the arc, Goind Merry Being Burned? End of The Arc, Luffy Burning the Marine Flag? hum... And now that the trap is laid, the audience wants to see more, so he dont need to be deep, so shallow plots and characters are just enough, as long as he can keep giving them what they want. And that's basically his formulae, and it works pretty well, he doesn't change it, people like repetition, Fairy Tail is also a ""success"" so... if you give people simple fights with Power Ups never seen before, boobs floating, Epic Moments at the end, Rinse and repeat, success, One piece is doing that with maestry in his last years, Fairy Tail do that since the beggining, and Naruto do that Since the end of the Genin Tournament.

"Plot (10/10) There is no animated work of fiction that has performed a greater worldbuilding than One Piece. Cultures, civilizations, power relations, it's a world with an impressive wealth of details. And even more impressive is how the author, Eiichiro Oda, was able to conduct such a long and detailed script with practically no plot holes. A striking feature is how the author often manages to use information that had been left at the beginning of the story, hundreds of chapters later, no information is wasted at all. Main character (10/10) Luffy is a character based on Goku, from Dragon Ball, and just like him, he has a pure heart and is always helping others, is always hungry, and when he eats, he eats a lot, doesn't have a great intellect, but is a genius in combat. He's a character who can seem irrational and empty-headed to the first-time viewer (and he often is, after all, that's the fun) but Luffy is a deeper and more well-developed character than he seems, and that development only increases with each passing arc. He has great emotional intelligence, a very strong sense of justice and morals, in addition to being able to recognize the strong from the weak, the allies from the enemies, with very little information, just by analyzing the personality. Luffy is a brave, dreamy, determined and loyal character, capable of anything to defend his friends and achieve his goals. He is also a character who goes through an intense process of personal maturation, making him rethink some of his ideals. Side characters (10/10) One Piece has a huge variety of characters, many of them are purposely funny-looking, some even seeming like caricatures, but there are also beautiful and stylish ones. Few anime know how to present a character as well as One Piece, often the break in expectation between presentation and reality generates humor. During the journey, Luffy recruits new ""nakamas"" (crewmates), each of them has unique and important skills, that will be needed at some point. They all have dramatic pasts that shaped who they are, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled with each one of them. Luffy's Nakama are as important, iconic and beloved as he is Art (10/10) Art is an essential part of One Piece. There are several islands and even countries, with different climates, cities and cultures. Not to mention the character design, which is extremely creative, and the diverse creatures and monsters that inhabit this rich world. Animation (4/10) In an anime with more than 1000 episodes, the animation quality will not remain constant like in a season anime with 12 or 13 episodes. However, this never bothered, until the Wano arc, where the animation style changed drastically, the anime became more colorful, with many special effects (like Dragon Ball Super). In this arc, the episodes that give the most audience receive animation worthy of a movie, these are the ones that have fights or important revelations, while the others received a power point animation. And in this arc the problem was not only in the animation, but in the direction as well, the inability to put the right soundtrack at the right time, or to manage to adapt an important scene correctly. Wano's arc wasn't well-adapted, so I can't give the animation a good rating. Despite having good animations in some episodes, this is not the reality for most of them. Soundtrack (10/10) One of the best, if not the best soundtrack I've ever seen in animes.",9,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8f3c875fec,33
"One Piece as a whole is a wonderful beautifully crafted story with amazing build up enhanced by its phenomenal worldbuilding and characters. Those factors make for extremely entertaining but also thought provoking lore. With all of that in mind the anime has many glaring issues that prevent it from being a perfect 10/10. The most potent of them all is the bad and even sometimes unbearable pacing which is made worse by the weak production that was evident through a solid portion of the show, this can drastically lower the viewers opinion on the show and so they would miss out on the good it offers.

"It was almost 3 years ago that I decided it was time to start the grates adventure ever told. Let me tell you it wasn't an easy start. Going into One Piece when I started there were less then 900 episodes but not far off. I told myself Ill give it 10 episodes and if I don't like it after that I will stop. Ill be honest the first time watching it I stopped after episode 1. I could not fathom why this show about a kid made of rubber who cant swim had almost 900 episodes worth of entertaining content. So I gave up and walked away. Then the pandemic hit and I sat down and said well if I am ever going to watch it all then now was the time...I had literally nothing but time so I forced myself past 10 episodes and I found myself asking questions about who and why things were happening and by episode 26 I was hooked. I know I really like something if I cry and that was the first of many moments in this show that have made my cry. It took me 6 months before I officially caught up with the show and ill tell you it was worth every second. I have never laughed so hard or cried so hard at an anime before this. 900 episodes just wasn't enough I was begging for more after 6 months of only One Piece. The Characters are Lovable and grow so much over time, not one detail in this show is unnecessary everything and I mean EVERYTHING is important. Oda the writer is amazing and I can only praise him in his work! The world feels alive when you watch this show, you know that things outside of the main story are affecting what is coming or what will happen in time. I have watched a lot of anime before this and I have watched alot of anime after this but I always come back to this show and am in AWE of everything about it. If your considering watching One Piece please do! I haven't met a single person who has watched it and given it a fair chance and hated it. You need to meet the main crew and get to around episode 20 before you decide if its for you or not. I can say nothing bad about this show other then sometimes fights get dragged out but that I have to say is typical of any Shonen in my opinion so I think overall its a 10/10 for me!",10,Recommended,"Dec 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b6b0da291,33

Also, the anime is pretty slow in some arcs, like in Dressrosa or in Whole Cake, the quality of the anime fell a lot after the timeskip. Besides that, in almost every arc we have some great moments that is something really unique about One Piece, and keep you excited to keep watching the anime, i cant think in any arc of the anime that haven't a single very emotional moment that can make you cry or something, and makes you want to continue watching. Also, seems that the anime is getting better with the new arc of Wano, both in animation and in rythm. I know that the arc in the manga is definitely one of the greatest, so i can't wait to see it.

For those of you who are wondering whether you should give One Piece a try, I encourage you to go do it. Why? Because One Piece changed my life. From stories, to characters, to sound, to art, One Piece has managed to catch my attention. Are there no boring parts? Oh, there are draggy parts. Are there no frustrating parts? Oh, there were, and some of them felt as if they would never end. But in the end, the journey was all worth it. It only took like two or three episodes for me to like One Piece. Then some few episodes later, I realized that I was in love with it. Ever since One Piece, no other anime ever caught my heart again. I was addicted to it, and I have not gotten addicted to anything else after it. I have to say that Oda is brilliant. For me, the first 300eps or so of One Piece were 100% perfect. After that, it went kind of downhill for me. After that, there were good and bad moments. But I stuck to it, and I don't regret it at all! Don't be afraid of starting One Piece. Yes, it's almost 1000 eps now. But I say, just enjoy the ride. Don't rush through it. Enjoy every moment. Savor the stories. Fall in love with the characters. Appreciate Oda's brain. Thank you for reading, and have fun in the world of One Piece! You will be surprised at how deep and exciting a story about Pirates could be. The story will blow your mind. The characters will capture your heart and you won't ever want to let them go. The songs will make you feel nostalgic. One Piece is 100% worth it. Trust me.

"One Piece holds a very strange position among anime. As one of the longest-running television series of all time with over a thousand episodes and at least five more years to go as of this review, it's garnered a following as one the THE must-watch series among otakus and weebs. It's art direction is stylish and often bizarre, and the overarching story features a massive cast of very well-developed characters. Too bad it takes a million years to watch. I dropped the series not because it's bad quality, but because I knew how much time it would take up and how many filler episodes there are. I can't help but wonder what the original author's mindset was when he began writing the manga. Surely he wasn't planning on letting it drag on for this long, was he? I can't give this series an objective score because I couldn't even get a tenth of the way through because far too much time is spent on villains monologuing after displaying their power or the Straw Hats needing to stop by an island to solve a local problem. I admire Toho Animation's dedication to making sure every arc is covered properly instead of skipping key plot points like Fire Force apparently did, but it's evident that this is only an extremely hardcore series for hardcore, dedicated fans. But is it good? How else has it gone on for so long???? I recommend this if you're willing to miss out on new releases for the next several seasons or potentially destroy your social life (do any of us weebs really have one?

"The story is good, but there is plot hole that disturb me when i watch it. There is so much island but the storyline sometimes makes me bored because i already know where this is going. Slow storyline and so much useless scene they put in the anime just because the anime doesnt precedes the manga. The comedy in this anime so much better then another anime action-comedy genre like naruto, bleach. The art in the old graphic is so much better for me, after time skip, they add to much color and it doesn't fit. Also Oda just cant make different heroine face in one piece xD, so much nami 1,2,3, and more lmao. The music in Anime is not too much good for anime in the long run class, and i think toei not good as pieriot when put a music into anime. The character in one piece is so unique, like the important character they have their unique laugh, and so much more. Power systems in this anime i think not as good like Naruto and Bleach, because before time skip i think devil fruits to strong/unbeatable especially logia, and than boom somehow haki showup in the one pieve universe and everyone can use it xD. well thats good because now they can counter logia and another annoying devil fruits users.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 1, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e3164058ca,33
"Goatnime, Love One Piece! The first is because this anime surprised me, and I've been wondering all this time, why didn't I watch this anime earlier. I've watched this anime until now episode 977, I'm not disappointed at all, I'm proud of Oda sensei, this is the first anime that makes me unable to watch or read others because I was made to feel at home by this anime. And secondly, I highly recommend this anime if you are a lover of the shounen genre. Because this anime really feels really shounen, you won't regret watching this. The animation is so beautiful, colorful. The third is about character development, ok, I really don't really like usopp and sanji's character development, because I think they haven't changed since the beginning, a little annoying, that's all. the fourth is the development of the world. I really like the development of the world in One Piece because it is referenced from the real world. oh yes, the flashback or filler does not harm the audience, best anime.",10,Recommended,"Jun 10, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1833df5b13,33
"The most complete work of all time — that's the way to describe One Piece. The anime has its slopes because of the winding and because of toei animation. But reviewing the anime, I saw that it doesn't matter close to how good the work can offer the person who is going to watch it. Luffy from the moment of his journey is already captivating, development of each character in the bunch makes us already get used to them, cry and be happy with them. In addition to having an impeccable development, we see the preparation of the direction in the middle of the work. The sadness scenes are very good and very well developed. I cry more in the anime than in the manga. The adventure is the most closed point of the series, because we want to see more and more. The use of soundtracks, direction is very good even with the lack of animation and time drag made to extend the time of the episode. Complete work, humor, development, story, and even more, script impeccable. The work increasingly demonstrates that everything was planned by the events that occur, and it becomes increasingly impossible to let go. There's no way to stop liking this work, because we are already so connected to the absurd development, that we forget even the mistakes and ramblings in the episodes. Oda's work on the characters and arcs is amazing, and each arc there are 1000 messages spoken. Racism, power control, friendship, happiness. All together in something just to emphasize us with the work more and more. Many also say about the art of One Piece. It's done in a funny way, and in the last few chapters we got the answer as to why. One Piece is a work to be funny, but it manages to be one of the most serious too, the author manages to put any emotion into the series, so if you don't want to watch One Piece because of the animation, you don't know what you're missing. In the case of this anime, the animation doesn't matter so much, if it has an impeccable direction lurking in it. Winding yes, it is one of the great criticisms of this work, to give screen time and when they adapt only 1 chapter of the manga, the anime becomes unbearable to watch at times. With fights that stare at the characters' faces for minutes and to occupy screen time and also not get too close to the manga, we see from afar, a problem in anime, but with so much good stuff, it goes unnoticed in the analysis, that's why my note will be the same. Deaths, one of the most debatable subjects, why don't any characters die? Well, this is a big problem for One Piece, as it takes the impact of possible deaths off the series. When a character can die in the work, we don't believe it, because we always see everything work out in the end. Of course, the scenes of sadness and impact, even without deaths, can make anyone cry or be in agony, due to the great development of One Piece, and that's why I believe, that so well the characters are introduced, Oda doesn't want to kill them, only when he already raises them to die. One of the best stories of all time, without a doubt, this series, brings everything good in a very well written. I say — thank you! Because this wonder exists.

"One piece, the most popular out of the long running shows. And this show is extremely long. One piece is really good. Only downside in the show is pacing but it’s not terrible just extremely mediocre. It doesn’t make the show dreadful to watch just very boring. The manga is definitely better but both are enjoyable. The animation at the beginning isn’t the best but it has a certain charm to it that later on you kind of miss it. I feel like the animes biggest strength is the time you spend with the characters. The manga is just the story, while the anime has little character moments. For example, the straw hats on the Sunny/Going Merry, Zoro and Sanji arguing, etc. It just makes the straw hats feel more like real people. I feel like most people’s goal starting one piece is to finish it, but then around Punk Hazard and Dresssrosa (maybe this is just me) I didn’t want to finish it anymore. I just wanted it to last forever. One piece from the first episode is great but somehow it grows on you more over the course of the series.

I am not saying that it's the best anime out there...but in terms of enjoyment, it is the best for me. You may find the art style a bit ugly but that won't stop you from falling in love with many characters because it has one of the best set of characters and character development. Animation continuously improves after every arc and the current animation is top tier. The only reason I gave it a 9 bcz it has pacing issues. So you have to be patient while watching it.

The incredible mix of comedy and plot, the wacky characters, the unique art style, all of this makes for an absolute magical experience while watching One Piece. Many believe that this series is going to be bad just because of the length and trust me I was there myself at some point however, I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this series really is. One Piece is so fast paced and exciting. By ""fast paced"" I mean there is a small amount of filler and it is just arc after arc after arc.

I gave it an 9 because it is outstanding in many categories, the bad thing about One Piece is deaths, Oda just makes some wack death scenes, makes an emotional death scene and BIG REVEAL, they are still alive. The animation in the Wano arc is insane. Since one piece has so much episodes and chapters, it also has so much details for many characters. This gives One Piece watchers/readers a lot to talk about and predict. Each ark has its ups and downs. The Art and sound were not the best early on because it is a 20 year old anime, but It didn't stop One Piece from being one of the best.

"Genuinely a great anime, good for Veteran anime-watchers to newbies to anime, the story line (in my experience) was amazing, i am currently on the skypiea arc and cannot express my enjoyment of this series' growth in depth. The way everything lines up is astounding, not to mention the character development seen from Zoro and Nami, genuinely a great anime from the beginning, can't wait to continue and sometime get to the Wano-Kuni arc!! But there is an issue with the way the Captain, Luffy, wins fights. His power levels are a bit inconsistent, and is always fluctuating up and down, now don't get me wrong, it makes fighting scenes way more enjoyable, but i just cannot get it out of my head.

"Easily the GOAT shonen anime. Over 20 years of story and NONE of it feels contrived. That buildup has resulted in easily the most worldbuilding, character writing and adventure in any piece of media I know of. The world of one piece is just SO ALIVE. Every little islands the strawhats come across has their own histories and inhabitants with their own little backstories. Seriously, there are seemingly thousands of different characters, probably a dozen of which are interesting enough to be their own protagonist in their own story. And like I said, none of it feels contrived. It all develops naturally, nothing ever feels forced at all. The writing is done masterfully such that each new adventure comes up organically. It genuinely feels as though every single plot point had been cautiously mapped out since the beginning. For such a long running story of such a grand scale, there are very few and minor inconsistencies in the story. One piece introduces some dude in chapter 200, basically disappears, then that dude is the most important character in his own 100 chapter arc starting at chapter 500?! Sounds crazy, but it works! It works because it fits into the greater story seamlessly, just like all arcs, and the character was interesting and memorable, just like all major characters. These are just some of the reasons why one piece has remained great for over a thousand chapters, and why I continue to be so invested after all these years.",10,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fed0950c93,34

Dont get me wrong, rhe show isnt bad. but it has been pretty meh from the beginning. so far ive reached the skypea arc which has been so hard to continue watching. im probably not going to stop here coz i plan to at least reach the marine ford arc before i reach a good verdict on the series. the problem i have with it is that ive tried loving it from the beginning but so far its not really worth the hype. its an ok series at best. Zorro is probably the best part of the show and he carries it for me. luffy isn't a very good protagonist and he can sometimes be annoying, the comedy in this show falls flat on its face and only serves to make the show more annoying, ussop is like the worst character in the show and chopper is an ok character. i really cant get into the show with such a boring main cast. anyway, if anyone had a similar opinion and the changed it later on please let me know when one piece got good for you coz i really want to get into this show",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 25, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bcbddce3e6,34
I love One Piece. It is my favorite anime But i would not recommend it to all because it is long but it is worth it if you like the story. If you like it you will see the changes over anime over the last 25 years from the East blue to Egghead. If you are planning to watch it I would start sooner than later because if you just go online you will see tons of spoilers. Some arks are slow like Dressarosa but if you do not like the pacing I would recommend reading the manga. Reading the manga would be faster if you can read the chapters in under 20 minutes too. But if you are willing to skip or just want to cech up fast but also want to see all the cool animation i would recommend either reading up to Marineford than watch the anime up to dressrosa than skip the first half of dressrosa to the Doffy fight than watch the anime to the current episode. You could just skip the filler and the intro and outros too.,10,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 26, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_780b4bb9a8,34

Although the premise is fairly simple, its' characters, world building, and dynamics/perspectives between the good and bad make this an enjoyable and absolutely worthwhile show. Long shows like this are never perfect, but with the constant flow of great content, it brushes away all the bad.

"One thing that you have to understand about One Piece is that whether you want to watch it or not, thinking it might not be for you is that that's valid. The excuse that it's too long is dogshit. But One Piece is the best written fiction ever. No other medium manages to create such a rich world with such and amazing story and characters with just one medium. Not even Tolkien. No other fiction that I have consumed (which is a lot) can even compare to One Piece. Other series can have great world building as well but nothing else does it so perfectly and contained within ONE MEDIUM. Not 10 books, 50 comics and 4 films. Oda does it with one continuous manga and there has yet to be anyone that have been even close to overcoming him.

"So what looks like a fun & goofy pirate adventure with friends actually holds so many deeper & darker tones then what you'd might imagine.. A few of those themes are: Racism, Slavery, Corrupt Govenrment, Family & Freedom.. So let's just get into it!! The characters: The characters of the story are golden worth. Some are more interesting then others obviously but to have such a HUGE cast of characters. HUNDREDS OF HUNDRES of characters and i remember so many of them.. Their face, backstory, actions and moments that was spent with them.. Characters that have only showed up in one arc will leave enough of an impression on you to last through out the whole story.. Even 1000 chapters/ episodes later. The villains of the story are also usually REALLY great.. Some of them are written in such a way that when they're shown on screen you just need to pay attention, they're such a scary presence that it just sucks you in.. The World: If amazing characters were not enough then let me tell you about the world. It's so dense and deep that it blows my mind how Oda can even keep up.. I won't go into too much detail but the world never sleeps.. Other stories and anime that have an ""expansive"" world.. Usually end up very flat.. That's not the case with one piece at all. Once our characters leave an island to move on with their adventure, that place doesn't just freeze in time or disappear out of existence. The world always seems so connected.. It's so hard to explain :( The Fights: With it being a Shounen, there's A LOT of fighting.. But what you'd usually hear about One Piece is that ""the fighting isn't what it's about"", which is true.. But that doesn't mean the fights are not interesting. They're insanely interesting and some of the more interesting in all of Shounen.. So in this universe we have these powers that are called ""Devil Fruits"". Which is just a cursed fruit that once you eat it, you'll gain an ability but lose your ability to swim.. Now what you'll gain is almost randomized, but you'll be in 1 of 3 catagories. Zoan, Logia & Paramicia. Zoan, these powers will revolve around animals and creatures. So transforming into a hawk for example.. There's usually 3 stages to these transformations, Normal form (your base form), Hybrid form (Mix of your base and creature), Pure form (The full transformation).. Zoans also have a special type grade called Mythical.. This means you're not limited to Animals and Creatures.. But Mythical beings aswell, one example being a Golden Buddah.. Logia, these powers will turn the user into an element.. Now that's not just ""Water, Earth, Fire & Air"".. Nonono.. There's Light, Darkness, Ice, lightning, Smoke, Sand etc. Any material or element you can think of, there's a power for it. Now it doesn't just mean you have to actively think about using the power. Let's say you get shot in the head, but the bullet will just pass through you and Paramicia, now this.. This is where Oda can really cook.. Paramicia fruits are basically ""Whatever the fuck else"".. Whatever oda can come up with that doesn't fit creatures or elements.. For example Luffys power! Being made of rubber! It turned his bones, hair, skin, organs & everything into rubber. With that comes the benefit of being bullet proof, can't get take damage with blunt objects, can't die from falling & obviously streching his body at will.. There's also powers like: The Chop-Chop Fruit, you can split your body at will and float around with your body parts & you're immune to being cut as you'll just split instead.. There's endless possibilities with these type of powers. So with all of these different powers, fights in the story are never boring. It becomes a game of figuring out what your opponent is able to do and how to counter it / play around it. Imagine a JoJo fight but actually interesting as the characters are actually good lol. Now any story is not without its flaws.. And one piece is not a flawless story.. Well.. I should say flawless anime.. As the anime is on a weekly production, that means they can't cover 3-4 chapters per 24 minute episode like any seasonal anime would.. They have to cover 1 single manga chapter per episode.. Which is usually around 15 pages long. That is clearly not enough material to cover in 24 full minutes so the pacing of the story really struggles a lot. Toei (the anime company) have to stretch out the story to almost ridiculous lengths to keep the production going every week without stopping, now if we compare it to Naruto which was also a weekly produced anime.. Naruto did the smart thing of doing filler arcs. Where we pause the conflict at hand and the actual story to just produce random bullshit episodes that don't mean anything in the actual story. Let's say we're gearing up for a war, but oops! Time for filler! Now we'er gonna spend 3 episodes oncovering a mystery about birds!!.. That type of filler you know? One piece sadly doesn't have that so what they opt to do instead is strech the episodes out so it matches the episode run time.. So they'll add in useless reaction shots, dragged out conversations with extremely long pauses and so much more.. That's the only flaw with the one piece anime in my opinion.. But trust me, when you can binge watch over 1000 episodes, this will not be an issue, as you can just keep the story going and move on to the next episode. Honestly, missing this story is just a shame. So go on, set out to sea and find the one piece.",8,Recommended,"Dec 25, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eb70db7041,34

The first thing I do not like: It's very entangled, they only need 3 things, it takes 30 to 40 episodes for them to complete. The second thing I do not like much: A long time ago I began to realize that the anime / manga began to be ""infantilized"", if I may say so, as before the animation was coarser, nowadays the animation is lighter. Now let's talk about the things I love about the play. First: Oda has a lot of creativity to create characters, I would never be able to create a single character on my own (of course he does not do it all by himself, but anyway, right?), So much so that I will be inspired by Oda's work to create the game I'm developing.

Every arc in the show is great while the storyline will keep you wanting to watch more, or even get hyped for as you meet new characters. The entire storyline of One Piece has tons of unsolved information. Even at this current time, lots of stuff has still to be answered. There's information about the sea. Like why is it so dangerous? What are the connections between the sea beast kings? The monsters that rule the sea. Also, what are their connections between certain people? There’s also information about the past. Like what happened in the void century. A time that nobody remembers but a few. even information about the powers in the show. Like where do they come from how many are there.

"If you want to get into One Piece 2020 Is definitely the time. I may be biased as this is one of my favourite series to date after binging it and reading it over the last few months, but I feel like its 100% worth getting into for any shounen fan and with the anime having a rise in quality for Wano there is no better time to catch up the anime or even read the manga (I primarily started reading after Enies Lobby). The anime itself has some pacing issues in places, which is why I personally do rate the manga higher, but the anime has some of its own amazing moments with a great soundtrack and some solid voice acting. I'd give the anime a try up until Arlong Park and if it isn't your thing read the manga and jump back In at Wano. Only a brief review and not the most in depth but I hope my enthusiasm will at least help someone to get into this incredible jam packed shounen.",9,Recommended,"Jun 5, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d268a6dd0f,34
"I got caught up to One Piece in December 2020 and since then, I'm watching it airing every week religiously following it. But what made me so much attached to it that I started buying character's figurines? It's actually the emotion. Yes One Piece is indeed the anime that made me experience all kinds of emotions. Happy satisfying moments, funny scenes, emotional deaths, epic storyline that makes you want to bingewatch it and how it shows the pain and suffering of this beautiful yet cruel world. I would say, the starting episodes are main character introductions so, dont judge the show by just watching 16-17 episodes. I myself found this anime interesting after watching episode 24. The main excitement of the show begins when the crew gets into the grand line. That's when everyone gets hooked to the show. Currently, airing arcs WCI arc and Wano arc have splendid animation and One Piece has shown some awesome fights recently. I'm not biased so I'd say the anime has pacing issues after episode 600, so you can shift to the manga which is top tier itself. But one shouldn't be afraid of the size of the show and must atleast give it a try.",10,Recommended,"Apr 6, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d02b1815c6,34
"I started this series expecting it to be a conquest. I wanted to be able to say that I had watched this ridiculously long anime. Little did I know that this show would change my life. What starts off as a fun and goofy adventure with a weird-looking art style-- yet dripping in 90s and early 2000s nostalgia-- quickly becomes one of the most heartfelt and cleverly written narratives that I had the pleasure of experiencing over the course of many years. It may be over 1000 episodes, but the series is still aiming at the unanswered questions that it posed on day one. Every arc delivers with a familiar formula, yet I am still regularly shocked by the amazing twists and turns that this story takes, which are often built on forshadowing that can be traced back many years. Eiichiro Oda never fails to deliver with a story that is cohesive and fully utilizes the well-developed characters and world that he has taken time to lovingly build. I have recently realized that the goal of the story that was clearly set out in the beginning feels entirely achievable and realistic after 1000+ episodes, and that this feeling was built up gradually without taking any shortcuts. Every arc gets the characters and the world one step closer to what will be the grand finale of grand finales. This show has moments that will bring you to tears, cover you in goosebumps, freeze in shock, and a soundtrack that perfectly enhances all of these moments. The ""weird"" artstyle delivers characters that look larger than life, yet are entirely believable and unforgettable. If you are looking for adventure and love, do not let 1000+ episodes intimidate you. You just need to start at the beginning-- as we all did-- with a desire to get whisked away into an exciting and emotional journey. And if you do get whisked away, just know that the adventure of a lifetime is a guarantee.",10,Recommended,"May 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0fbed526cb,34

"As a shounen anime it has really fun arcs that are worth your time, my personal favorite parts being Skypeia, Thriller Bark, and Impel Down. The story also has lots of inspiring characters. Luffy is accepting of everyone and simple minded-ly only cares about protecting his friends. Nami may use unfair means to try get money, but she truly has a good heart and deeply cares about others. The OPs and EDs are amazing and I love the crazy character designs for even the side characters. The show may be long, but I believe its worth people's time to learn about all the amazing islands and new crew additions as the story goes along. My only problem is the animation getting lazy in recent episodes causing repeated animation and slow pacing ruining the show.

The show also suffers from animation issues. --------------------------------- Sound: 7/10 Some of the tracks are good and memorable.

Not until very recently (Wano arc), the art in the show was pretty unfaithful to the very well-drawn manga. In general, the anime was very faithful to the manga, but the art, pacing issues, and typically bad animation get in the way of the experience. I've watched 69 episodes so far (nice lol), but for now I'm probably gonna stick to the manga when I get a chance to buy another volume.

"If I didn't love this series i wouldn't have given it such a high rating now i will proceed with my explanation. Keep in mind i won't be talking about one piece itself but more about the anime adaption. Toei did a fine job with sound, animation, characters. The problem is pacing and to keep it short it's trash. To extend episodes Toei shifts between characters and adds extra scenes that weren't in the manga but were heavily implied. The second part isn't so bad but the first part. I'd prefer if Toei just delayed episodes like Mappa did with AOT season 4 so we can have an adaption more focused on manga content and better pacing. At the end of the day it's an adaption not a replica but god it's a terrible adaptation Toei just wants money at this point though i'll admit the wano animation is beautiful but also a bit sloppy at times.

"One piece é um anime Shounen com uma história e um mundo fantástico, e eu quero simplesmente julgar a nota, os pontos positivos e negativos de cada arco dessa obra gigantesca(East Blue até Whole Cake pois Wano ainda não terminou): East Blue: este arco se divide em 3 sagas principais, sendo elas: Romance Down, Orange town e Arlong Park; Romance down: a saga em si é chata e possuí um lento desenvolvimento, mas possuí um bom foco na comédia, o estilo shounen é bem escasso nessa saga, portanto, não espere uma boa porradaria; Orange town: essa saga é um tanto mais movimentada que Romance down, sendo bem apresentada de maneira divertida e rápida; por fim, Arlong park é com certeza a melhor saga e o foco do East Blue, afinal, é nessa saga que temos os primeiros conflitos realmente dramáticos e importantes de One piece, e também, é nesta saga que One Piece começa a pegar as características de um Shounen, tendo um bom antagonista(Arlong) e coadjuvantes medianos.

"5. Continuing from my Naruto, DBZ, Digimon and Pokemon reviews, I am still documenting my anime journey. While we all were addicted to DBZ, One Piece was airing before it everyday. It was still a small show about pirates. It was light hearted and adventurous. We watched it because there was literally nothing better on TV and to be honest we quite enjoyed it. It was funnier than DBZ and Naruto. Its fights were down to ground back then and quite simple. While we were tired of Naruto fillers and awaiting more combat and DBZ was slowing down despite being so slow already, One Piece was taking off. The fights became more fierce, the arcs were diverse and interesting. The emotional stuff was destroying our hearts much more than Naruto's did. It was a great story and we were hooked. Every episode was fun, even if it was a filler it was integrated in the arc and we truly could not distinguish a filler episode from an actual manga original one. They had humor and sadness equaling real episodes! Not just throw away fillers to fill some time like Naruto or DBZ. The East Blue introduction arc was slow but steady, it knew where it was going and took the distractions on the journey. Using them to flesh out the characters. Ging Freecss from HunterXHunter said something like that it is better to enjoy the little distractions on the adventure. The Arabasta and Sky Island arcs took it up a notch and were amazing stories with great battles. Dvorak's New World symphony playing during the final battle blew my mind. They truly made it epic! And then it happened, the battles evolved. Gear Second, Gear Third. Water Seven and Enies Lobby arc changed the whole game. The protagonists got upgrades and the battles evolved to rival if not even succeed those of Naruto and DBZ! While Naruto Shippuuden was slowly abandoning the superb tactical shinobi combat for more DBZ ""ima throwing my laser"" type of combat. One Piece was not falling in that pitfall. Every episode, every arc is just such a blast! Watching on TV was not enough, I rewatched the entirety on the internet in Eng sub. Got further in the story because TV dub is just too slow. Manga was even more amazing! Eiichiro Oda is an amazing artist! In fact there are only 2 manga artists I truly revere and that is Oda and Kentaro Miura (Berserk). The time of DBZ was over, the new generation needed a new king. The successors were the Jump's big 3: One Piece, Naruto and Bleach. Bleach fell of quickly and Naruto stumbled but ended. One Piece is the true king of Shounen and successor of DBZ. A couple more years and One Piece (1997) will outsell even Superman (1938), Batman (1939) and Spiderman (1962) in comic sales! Truly a king of kings. The show has shaped my life greatly and I still carry many of its lessons. Don't get me wrong, the show is not perfect, but what is? I had a new standard now, if shows were even a quarter as good as One Piece, I would recognize and give them a chance. A chance I gave to the highly promising Bleach, a choice I would regret further down the line..",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_931fb374b5,35
"I started watching this series to see what the fuss was all about. I like the premis of the story, the art and the characters (no developements though), but the pacing is awful. Most of the times I skip 5-8 minutes at the beginning of an episodes until the story slowly progresses. I didn't mind that much when there was a good story arc, I just felt sightly annoyed. But now I reached an arc, which is not that engaging to me, so the slow pacing really takes away a lot of the overall enjoyment. It might have been really good, if they had paused once in a while to break it into several seasons à 25 complete episodes.

"To be honest my score should not be taken too seriously because most of the 10s are what I give for the manga. Overall the anime is great, but it really is way bad compare to the manga. The story, if regardless most movies, no doubt will be 10/10. The way how it took off my personality mask and touched me is great indeed, when Usopp Pirates disbanded, when Hiluluk laughed about his coming death, when Saul told Robin nobody is born to be lonely, when Coby stopped Sakazuki and trying to protect the rest of the marine soldiers, when Kyros was holding Scarlett's body and crying for his helplessness, when Corazon put Law in that treasure box and guarded him until his last moment, when Senor Pink traded his dignity in exchange of Russian's smile, when minks guarded Raizo with all of their lives with a honor, when Pudding made her choice with Sanji, probably the man who would love her more than any other man in the world, and the man she may never seen again... I do not know who would stonefacing these scenes. The art... I have to say almost all good looking characters are looking the same, but from little bit this, and a little bit of that, we could effortlessly tell who they are. The sound track, I did not continously watching it except major fight and some episodes because the pace is just so sluggish that I felt it is torturing me. But I do found Luffy Moukou and The Very, Very, Very Strongest being my favorite. Characters are quite spread in the story, so I guess it kinda equal to it I would say I enjoyed the series... Man I just hate writing too much words... Overall it is my favorite show along with Jojo, Seven deadly sins, Yugiohs, dumb funny animes, and other animes that I am too lazy to provide names... Only reason that the anime receives a 6 is because its sluggish pace...... by the time Luffy had his first fight with Kaido, he probably already became the pirate king in the manga......

Every side character, new arc, and new area is so compelling and drives you on Luffy's journey, keeping you engaged throughout its numerous episodes.

"Easily one of the best shounen ever !! One might say i am exaggerating. Great story , good pacing. The way the story progresses is actually great for me too. The soundtrack and OST especially during the battles or when some truth or suspense is revealed is superb ngl. The fact that Luffy's dumb personality at times tends to annoy us and the amount of times he gets lucky could be overlooked for me. Its a burden but a slight one. The character development is done in a proper way as a result of their struggles ,losses, escape by insane amount of sheer luck. The world building of One Piece also deserves a mention in a hugely positive way. It mostly kept me wondering what will happen next and forth after most episodes.

"I am currently at about the halfway point of the series and I am here to tell you if it’s worth all of the effort to watch this series. In short: Yes, if you’re willing to commit to it. The story starts off a bit slow and begins to pick up over time. The one problem I have is the amount of irrelevant fillers that make an appearance in episodes. I don't mind a gap between arcs because you can always skip those episodes. In recent episodes, I have had a problem with filler dialogue that doesn't really contribute to the overall story at all. Like there could be a whole episode that has half of the time dedicated to minor characters and it disrupts the flow the story. Another thing, some of the arcs feel like they are dragged on forever. It just doesn't reach a conclusion in a reasonable fashion, which is irritating. However, the longevity of the series can also be a positive in developing the plot. Luffy and his crew run into a lot of interesting people which allows them to make connections that later can become relevant to the plot. For now, I have to give this series a 7/10.

"Just finished the Marineford arc and suppose that I should make a review on what I've watched so far. The plot actually is quite good, even though carrying the mainstream shounen anime and a little bit straight-forward. As you watch the anime, you can easily tell that every episode is intriguing ( I don't know if you want to count fillers ). Also, every arc I watched so far does not disappointed me at all, even though some maybe better than the others. And it is also have originality, maybe because its concept that is rare in shounen anime. Just because it left a complexity, I'll rate the story 8. The art is not so compelling as the story is at the beginning, but as you follow every episode, the art is beginning to improve. Although not as good as the other newer animes, the art is good enough for at least myself. I'll rate the art 7. The soundtracks, OP and ED are really good and well placed, suitable with the story that is about the pirates and adventures. Guess I'll say nothing more about the sound and rate it 8. The character development of every Straw Hat crew is quite good, considering the adventure that they had experienced. It's impressive how the adventure had make them more mature and stronger in terms of physical, mental, emotion and their will. I'll rate it 8. The anime is really, really, really enjoyable. The anime can make you laugh, being amazed and cry at the same time. So, I'll rate the enjoyment 10. Overall, this anime is one of the best anime that I've watched so far. Why not the best? Because there are some anime that is same level as One Piece. BTW, I'd recommend this for those who loves shounen anime. So, say no more, I'll rate this anime an outstanding 10. P/S : And for those who says that this anime sucks, open your hearts please. One Piece isn't as bad as you think. Don't be so judgmental just because the art is not so compelling, the episodes are too many or whatever that makes it looks bad to you.

"While i would without a doubt give manga 10 out of 10, anime just doesn't deserve such generosity. You know that something is wrong, then your anime looks much, MUCH better during episode 300 than during ~700. I guess Toei realised that they don't need to pump any money into this, kids will still watch it- so we have a miserably bad animation (ironically, the best animated scenes are these where characters are just talking, any movement, especially backgrounds, looks embarassing at best) and annoying reuse of sound effects... You laughed at CLANG from berserk? One Piece STILL uses Dragon Ball Z sound effects! Bad animation alone wouldn't be much of a problem, if the story was good, right? And it is- if you look at the entire arc. Single episodes are boring as f*** unless you skip through them. Every episodes starts at time of 6:00 and ends at 22:00. Subtract 20s of eyecatcher, another minute of camera slowly moving through ugly backgrounds and another one minute of reused scenes from previous episides and you end up with each episode lasting maybe 14-15 minutes. And even this is stretched as much as Toei can, with dozens of characters reacting to every mc actions and filler fights. Most episodes cover a single, 18-pages long chapter. Even other long-running series, like Bleach or Naruto, used to cover at least 2 chapters. But i said ""MOST"", because there are some that cover... less. Imagine entire episode based on, let's say 10 pages, that you could read under 8 minutes. Stretched to a full episode! That's a regular OP episode. Watching one piece without skipping is painfull, but hopefully there are still some fairly good episodes, every now and then (i somehow watched through entire Law's past without skipping a second). Also, the material anime is adapting is outstandingly good, even if this hideous cartoon would suggest otherwise. Something went really, really wrong with this anime. I mean, it used to be better- not only the animation peaked during Ennies Lobby/Summit War, but also anime used to cover at least 1 chapter per episodes (and sometimes- it's actually enough). But nowadays watching one piece is just exhausting- for example, Dressrosa Arc lasted for 100 chapters in the manga... and 120 in the anime! Whole cake- 80 v 100! I simply can't imagine the torture of watching it weekly, in front of tv, for full 30 minutes. I'd forgot what all was about before Dressrosa could end... But there's a simple explanation to it all- the manga counterpart. Obviously, Eichiro Oda is a god of mangamaking, and each volumes sells in millions. Also One Piece airs on sunday morning, next to a freaking dragon ball and other kid's favourite shows. Of course millions will watch it ANYWAYS, so Toei doesn't have to spend more than, i guess, ""enough"". They do not have to compete with other series. And Toei knows it- they know that if they aired more than 4 episodes of filler in a row, less would watch it (and sadly, some filler were pretty fun). That's why they decided to move at such a slow pace, because even showing one minute of new content is enough to attract millions of people in front of TV... But hopefully animation slightly increased in recent episodes. But OP anime is still a shadow of its former self.",7,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4ae531309e,35
"Right now, at 2:40 in the morning for me, I have decided to write a review for quite possibly my favorite anime of all time. However, I have decided to write it for people who might be off put by the length of One Piece. One Piece, first and foremost, is an anime/manga that follows the story of 1 of many pirates, Luffy, whose dream is to become the Pirate King. Pretty standard shounen stuff right? At first glance, you might be inclined to just skip past this, not only due to it's length, but to it's seemingly generic plot. Generic Shounen Guy wants something, and he's probably going to get it because he's Generic Shounen Guy. That however, isn't the point behind One Piece at all.This anime/manga mainly details the JOURNEY to becoming the Pirate King. One Piece isn't about Luffy's dream to becoming Pirate King, it is about the journey he takes to get there. Story: One Piece has one of the greatest story's I have personally ever read, and a large part of that has to do with the completely unique story One Piece portrays. Yea, you could say that One Piece has elements from other things, but doesn't everything? The story is just grand (outside fillers, which surprisingly, aren't even that awful. And Skypia. I think I'm the only one that doesn't like skypia though) and when things happen, even to characters that you know won't be around during a majority of the adventure, you tend to feel for them. Art: Unlike most older animes, One Piece's art style has honestly aged well, and only gotten better. Nuff Said. Sound: The OST for One Piece is honestly One of the best Piece's of music I've ever listened too. (get it?) The openings are fantastic, and so are the endings. Characters: The characters in One Piece are extremely unique, and are pretty much all memorable, if not by name, but by what they looked like or what they said. Some characters just had a certain way of speaking, others looked extremely funny, and some were just memorable in general. Enjoyment: Some animes that are much shorter than One Piece have often gone on the backburner when I get in the mood for One Piece, mainly because if I'm in that mood, I can't really scratch my anime itch unless I watch some One Piece. Overall: Definitely the best anime I've ever seen, and I challenge anyone to give me one better.",10,Recommended,"Mar 6, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e6d8be011f,35
"There are a large amount of reviews for One Piece, so I expect this one to be swallowed by the rest, but I simply have an urge to talk about this show, but simply utilizing one paragraph would not be enough to captivate even a percentage of the genius that this show provides. One Piece stands above its genre: One Piece is not just a good show. While this may be a cliche sounding line, I seriously believe this to hold much more weight than just ""it's a good shounen"". One Piece swept many kids off their feet and showed them a world like no other- where your imagination could be free. For many this was a large part of their childhood, the manga, the anime, the theories, forums, Youtube... This show took many people's lives and ransomed it for all it was worth. One Piece is a show I'd trade some of the best shows in shounen for its existence. Mystery, romance, slice of life, comedy,psychological, action.. This show doesn't just fit into one genre, and it never leans too much into one way of writing. Many shows nowadays are boiled down. Oh this show is X, and it is good because Y. One Piece takes X and Y and then says ""let's add the whole alphabet"". Some might say they like One Piece for its action, others might say they remember it for its sad moments, others might analyse the master craftsmanship of Oda and his ability to make the world breathe with foreshadowing, preplanning, backshadowing, backstories, and its overall design philosophy. This show doesn't just stand as a battle action manga, it stands as a reminder that a show can be art. Arcs: You can take a single arc from One Piece and it could stand as its own story - with themes, ideas, teachings unfolding into what I perceive as just a peek into Oda's mind. Each arc feels widely different, but still upholds everything that came before it, making a widely different story tie into the grand narrative that is One Piece. From ninjas and samurais, to giants and dwarfs, to merman and sea creatures, to animal people, and sky islands. The show never stands still, never feels like it's held back by some imposed restriction, and because of that, while the show is creeping up towards 1000 episodes now, people still crave more. Characters: Characters in One Piece are by far the best part. Jujutsu Kaisen goes to show that animation and action cannot save poor characters. With lacking depth and actual character, with hardly any backstories or reason to care about the characters on screen, you're often left rooting for characters based on how cool their power is. One Piece says ""screw that"" and fleshes out even minor characters, with practically any character that is involved in the story having some level of a backstory or explanation for why they exist. Usually these backstories are really well written as well, with even the dumbest looking characters leaving you in tears over how harsh and or inspirational their backstory is. Or they'll have a backstory that will make you hate them even more than you did. These details may not be fleshed out straight away, with a lot of the start of One Piece having quite one-dimensional villains and forgettable moments, but Oda goes back on even some of the more mundane characters and fleshes them out later on, again, tying very small percentages of the show, arcs, moments that pale in comparison to its size, and puts them in the limelight just enough that even the smallest of moments have a place in the grand narrative that is One Piece. The main backstories and good writing around the start of One Piece, and what will even propel you to go as far as the grandline is the main cast. The start of One Piece may feel long, with 60 odd episodes of fleshing out the main cast, giving them a present story, a backstory, and a reason to join Luffy's crew. This is by far the most important part of the show though, as everything that follows it relies on this first major arc as the backbone to for which the show resides on. Even this early back, with very short arcs, you still get to see the genius of Oda in how he designs his stories. Each island has a theme, each side or main character on that island has a story or a tie in some way or another, and each island teaches the viewer a new lesson, and with each lesson the cast develop, growing stronger both physically and mentally, gaining new resolve and upholding previous resolves that they then carry on their shoulder throughout the rest of the show. We deal with loss, control, terror, slavery, hunger, power, lying, betrayal, beliefs, dreams, hopes... All within the start of the show. Presenting the world in both its darkest and greatest moments, showing the depth of each character and what drives them forward, or what brings them down. When you make a villain the reader cares about, you know you've written a good story. Even past the large wall that is the grandline, or past the dangers of the calm belt, characters all over the sea, moments passed, memories at this point, still live and breathe and react to the news, bounties and stories that are passed down from Luffy's adventure. While a mild touch, this goes to show that everything matters in One Piece. You aren't experiencing a linear path of a hero defeating villains, you are experiencing a interconnected woven web of hundreds of characters and their point of view. Characters that are long gone still manage to retain importance, either by being brought back, mentioned, or even being set as the crux of a new situation that resides 100s of episodes away. This style of writing works both ways, with characters being mentioned, foretold, only to wait 300-500 episodes for them to even show up. A symbol isn't just a symbol, a sword is not just a sword, info is not just throwaway, all of these drops in the ocean ripple out towards the future and the past. This world is living and breathing outside of the main cast. Luffy despite being the MC isn't selfish enough like most shounen MCs to hold the flame as he marches forward. While his shines the brightest, everyones holding a match or a lantern, and sometimes they even start bonfires, forest fires. This shared importance to writing characters is what makes One Piece characters some of, if not the best characters in all of anime. World: The world of One Piece is large, and every part of it is intentional. Each island, landmark, ocean designed exists for a reason. The all blue, red line, grand line, new world, calm belt, 4 seas... Each major idea proposed allows for your imagination to go wild, and enough of it is left open to interpretation, or shrouded in mystery. Why is it designed this way? How did these things naturally form? Were they created? This is just the layout of the world, but it goes deeper. The will of the ""D"", Celestial Dragons, World Government, Gold Roger, the forgotten history, poneglyphs, Revolutionary Army, The King, Cipher Pol, 7 Warlords, 4 Emperors, and the most important mystery and plot device in the whole show: the One Piece. Who, what, where, why, when... I swear the English language needs more W's, as the level of depth that shoots passed the introduced narrative of ""an action pirate adventure"" is mind boggling. Theories, hourly long videos, ""who would win?""... This has spawned more content than the actual show provides. From Youtube, to Reddit, you have an endless sea of conversation. The day this show ends won't be the end as people reread, rewatch, find new clues, background characters, signs, foreshadowing, backshadowing, anything that they can get their hands on. This show will be dissected from the toes up and be used as an example of how to write fantasy. This show isn't just a cartoon, anime, it is fantasy on the levels of 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Lord of the Rings'... Because of its comic/manga book presentation, and it being a cartoon, the show may never have been on such a historical level as those books, but those who have dedicated themselves to this series know deep down if people were more open to One Piece this could be a global phenomenon of hype. Sound/Music: While an anime exclusive, I can't help but talk about this music/sound in this show. VAs in Japan do a much better job overall than a lot of the world due to its strict requirements in Japan's media business. So it is a no brainer that the VAs for One Piece are good, but some of the performances here are amazing. I never once think to myself that a voice doesn't match a character, or a voice is unsettling/off. Yet I do get brought out of the moment at some of the lines and delivery of characters like Nami, Luffy, Hiriluk - this only being a few early characters, because of how heartfelt and impactful the delivery is. Alongside these moments is the music. While One Piece repeats a lot of soundtracks, the music is what truely makes you feel something, and once you get familiar with some of the common pieces of music in One Piece, as soon as the first few notes play, you either know something epic is going to happen or you're going to be balling your eyes out in the next few minutes. I love anime that makes me feel something beyond my body's ability to hold itself together - but One Piece has done that so many times I lost count. I've cried over inanimate objects in this show for Petes sake. Then the moments where cool shit starts happening... I cried tears of joy, had my body shake with excitement, and verbally yell in my room by myself ""LET'S GOOOOO!"". This show is pure joy, and I can see myself down the track past its airing state rewatching scenes 100s of times... Hell, I already do that. Art/Animation/Pacing: Sadly, with most things, it isn't perfect. Now before I get hate, I want to say, this is anime exclusive. Oda is a great artist, while these characters seem odd at first juxtaposed to most generic anime art styles, the art in the show is expressive, allowing for odd and unique character designs, something a lot of shows struggle to create. The art is timeless, and Luffy being made of rubber was the perfect design for extremely over the top perspectives and insanely creative moments. As a former artist myself, I wouldn't even dare to challenge Oda and his creativity, and attention to detail. His ability to create perspective, depth, animation within still pictures is immensely respectable, and he doesn't get enough appreciation for this. Despite this, the anime lacks in a lot of places. With scenes of sloppily stitched together frames, to a ton of freeze frame moments or cuts that make you feel like something happened, but realistically nothing was animated. The colours and art is inconsistent, something you'd expect from a show of this size, but still disappointing nonetheless. There is love in here, moments that are crazily animated, great art, but it dips up and down constantly leaving a lot to be desired. Wano (current One Piece arc) is great in this dimension, but even Wano has times where things feel oddly still/unsatisfying due to the shows poor pacing passed Thriller Bark, leaving more than half the show to a crawl in pacing. A show that could of been adapted within 333-334 episodes in total if done at 3 chapters (usual anime adaption amount) an episode by the time it reached 1000 chapters, but instead we have nearly 1000 episodes matching 1000 chapters. If this show had the treatment of HxH, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Punch Man, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, it would be undisputed as the objectively best long running show among most anime fans. I hope in the future it gets this treatment, but as of its current presentation, it's bearable, and still loveable outside of the manga, but binging it is the only way to really enjoy your time here, as watching weekly or even just a few episodes at a time will hurt around post time skip arcs. While I still love it, I have stopped watching numerous times waiting for it to get somewhere before I bother catching up again. Despite this, some of the best moments are in the anime because of the music, voice acting, and animation creating an experience that isn't possible in the manga, but as an overall experience it is often dampened by its flaws, and pales compared to the quality of the manga. Conclusion: I could talk all day about One Piece - writing until I've created my own book about it - but I wouldn't want to waste your time, or my time. One Piece is outstanding. Oda's writing, the worldbuilding, the characters, the culmination and strive for perfection. You can feel Oda's soul through his work, and I'll carry this journey through the rest of my life. One Piece is a passion for me. Which sounds odd given it's just entertainment, but I truly care about this show. I will die on the hill that this show is more than just a show, it's art - and as logically contradictory as that sounds, it is the only way I can express the meaning this show carries for me, and everyone who loves it. I hear all the time jokes about its length, people claiming it is too long to get into, that no show is worth the time investment. Alas, I started rewatching One Piece again, this time with a friend, experiencing it all over again. If my experience isn't enough to get you into One Piece, surely you must hate art (haha).

"Where do I begin…? XD I put off this anime for a LONG time, but I seriously regret that now, partially because I now have to catch up -.- but also because… well…I can’t really fault this series at all! XD This is my first review so I’ll try cover everything I can think of! And this review will be 100% spoiler free (I’m prone to spoilers myself…) NOTE: I watch the FUNimation dub. Story: If your looking for an anime with a solid plotline your watching the wrong anime. The main point of the series is finding the treasure left by the infamous pirate Gol D. Rogers, the One Piece. However where I am at the moment this has been interrupted by a side mission to help someone, and I’m guessing this is how the story will continue. (Note: I know NONE of the story past where I am now, I don’t read the manga or watch the sub) Despite the randomness of story it’s still brilliant and extremely entertaining, which, let’s face it, is the main point of a story. As for the pirate aspect of the story…I have no interest in pirates (another reason why I put it off), but to be honest Luffy’s crew is not your average pirate crew…to say the least XD Art: Okay, so THIS is what put me off the series for so long, and looking back at that now I feel slightly embarrassed…I really love the art now! It’s different, unique I guess you might say, which is exactly why I liked anime such as Soul Eater. When I was deciding on whether to watch One Piece or not, I kept coming across forums and people saying “Don’t worry the art improves after a while.” I’ve seen a bit of the “improved” art and to be honest I think I prefer the old one, but that’s just a personal preference I guess. Anyway, anyone reading this DO NOT do what I did and not watch the series because of the art, because you will regret it! XD Characters: What can I say? Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of this show is the characters. Where I am in the series, there are 6 members in the crew, each one as different as the next. This variety of characters is one of the strongest points of the series. There is BOUND to be someone in the crew that you will love. As for the main protagonist, he’s just as idiotic and loveable as so many other main shounen characters. In fact, he’s probably more idiotic and loveable than all of them combined! You only have to say the name Monkey D. Luffy and I’ll start laughing! To be honest, this show is worth watching just for Luffy…well, him and Zoro maybe ^^” Sound: I’ve loved all the opening and ending songs so far, and I particularly love how FUNimation dubs them using voice actors (Vic Mignogna singing the first opening definitely helped me to keep watching, not that I really needed any help…) As for the music in the show, I don’t notice it that often, but when I do, it’s very fitting and works well with whatever is happening at the time. Off the top of my head I can think of one example of a song that plays at sad moments and really helps set the mood, it’s a beautiful piece of music. Enjoyment: This anime is perhaps one of THE best anime in relation to enjoyment. I haven’t found myself being bored once. The other day I found myself watching an episode and when I was finished I realised nothing had happened in it…and I was still so entertained by it! It didn’t fail at one moment to keep my attention. The fights are also brilliant and don’t tend to drag too much (in fact they may be a little short XD) To be honest, there are few other shows that have made me laugh as much as One Piece. Overall, this anime is a MUST SEE! And what’s brilliant about it is despite it being a mainstream, long running shounen, it has practically no fillers! (And even when it does I find it really hard to differentiate between them and the canon story) Sure, the story drags at points but that’s to be expected from an anime like this, and unlike other series, I don’t notice the drag as much. It’s just too entertaining for that! XD I would give this series a 9 but looking over my review the only flaw I can find is it drags a little…however I’m not sure about giving it a 10 because of this…so I guess I’ll have to give it a score of 9.5!",9,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6aac89a9b4,35
"What should I say about this Anime? Now I'm not one for long running Anime's, always drawn into things like FullMetal Alchemist and Code Geass... but what surprised be about One Piece was the CHARACTERISATION. You follow the story of a young green-horn pirate called Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to find the One Piece. Leaving his home town on a journey to become Pirate King. Along the way he meets friends who he takes upon his crew where there the story only just begins as trial and error becomes apparent in their every turn. This forms the crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. If that short snippit doesn't seem like much, let me explain. If you're full on personalities of characters, Eiichiro Oda has provided that in One Piece with a DON. No matter what character you meet, even if you hate them or love them, have a backstory so unique to them that you can't ever shake it off. It attaches to you. If something happens to a character, it's never forgotten, if there's a bonding between two characters it instantly becomes apparent through each episode you watch and never breaks. You will find yourself having feelings for characters you would believe to be side fluff, but instead you have those tissues out ready to blow your nose. You're not just journeying with the Straw Hat pirates, you're EXPERIENCING and LEARNING with them, you're almost taken on board with what's happening which makes the experience so gratifying. The negatives is it's a hard series to get into, and I fully suggest if you start watching One Piece, or beginning the Manga, that you STICK WITH IT. If you want to see the juiciness of what this creation is all about this Anime does need a lot of your time and efforts to push through to the engaging episodes. When you reach engaging episodes, sometimes there will be some areas where they drag it on way too long and you find yourself frowning at the screen because the same fight has been happening for 5-10 episodes. This IS COMMON EARLY ON, however it becomes less and less in the later series. Filler, even though it's few and very far between, is awful. There is a mini series episodes tucked which is dedicated to a few spin off titles of One Piece that are not so bad but the filler... is just filler. There's nothing special about it, although it's understandable why filler happens. When I started One Piece I had a lot of free time on my hands, it almost became a daily watch for me since I had the time after my studies during University which is why I got so far in such a short time. However, don't let not having any time deceive you from watching this Anime if you are interested because I promise it gets awesome. Real awesome. I can't stop watching it any way.

"Has great story and world building but it gets lost especially early on with the pacing. It felt like a chore to watch the first couple hundred episodes, I held on and kept on watching since i heard from so many that it gets really good later on and its worth it to deal with the pacing issues. Some of the episodes and arcs had an unbelievable amount of wasted time or filler for example the same flashback was shown 48 times in one arc. While it does get good later on i would not recommend anyone to stick it through and watch all the episodes I would recommend to watch a summary video on youtube of the first couple hundred episodes or watch arc summary videos for the first few arcs and then start watching from there. Overall it's a good show with a great story, world, and characters that everyone should watch but i currently can't give it a higher score since i can't just ignore the issues that affect a large portion of the show and make it just unenjoyable to watch some episodes and even arcs. I might raise the score up to a 6 or even a 7 depending on how it ends and the pacing of the coming episodes.",5,Recommended,"Feb 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fe53cd539d,35
One Piece is one of the most well known anime/manga and is one of the longest running show ever. It revolves around the Straw-hat Pirates lead by Captain Monkey who strives to become the Pirate King. He is the possession of the Gum Gum Fruit which allows him to stretch his body like rubber. The arcs are very good and enjoyable and slowly show the character development. The Straw-hats are bunch of very enjoyable and rowdy characters which are very easy to like. Each member has their own goals and unique abilities which help the plot in many ways. The show is way too long... but it is a must watch. You will understand the show's amazing story and mysteries only if you have watched the show. The anime shows how the Straw-Hats development from being weak pirates to one of the most wanted pirates in the One Piece world. The manga has now proceeded to the best arc of One Piece and I strongly suggest to pick up this legendary series.,10,Recommended,"Apr 7, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b5c4d90ee1,36
"You pull up to One Piece thinking it's about some stretchy guy who wants to find some lame ass treasure, but in reality you enter the most fucking amazing god piece of writing world. this show is legit better than any shounen, romcom wtv im fucking love one piece. its portrayed childish but battles deep asf themes and everything is linked and the plot is so deep, every arc is an adventure, every moment feels like you're with the mugiwara no ichimi. One piece legit makes me smile my dick off like why is this so goddamn good. I watched it because I myself wanted to experience this journey, not recommended or planned to watch, it was just a random interest and i don't regret any of it. omfg and even though the pacing is pretty shit in new world, i dont care because it is so goddamn peak man. legit goated and every ost legit puts me in the feels or gets me hyped like the good moments in the show are uncountable. I have to say don't watch one piece for the fights, it's not about the fights, if you're braindead asf then just watch like dbs or naruto or some shit if u want goated fights. The fights are mediums for the storytelling and the progression of characters instead of state of the art animation but 0 backbone anime battles. not saying the fights are bad because wano has had me creaming every single second in terms of production quality. Characters are just so lovable and every arc leaves you satisfied with a smile on your face, and it's just so nice seeing each character face their problems and how Luffy always pulls up when shit matters most. Every character on the crew is just so fleshed out more than any other side characters I've ever seen, it truly feels like you know them personally. For me, being on this journey is something I will never regret. Every mystery just gets me hyped asf to find out more about. I fucking love one piece and its not fucking mid you dogs.

"Imagine a world where we had a One Piece anime, that stuck to the story very closely with no BS filler, good pacing, and animated by a studio like Madhouse. Sounds great, doesn't it? I wish this was reality, because one of the greatest Shonen Manga ever written deserves so much more than the garbage we got that is this anime. I don't even know how many episodes I've actually watched since I must have skipped at least 150 because they were filler/extremely poorly paced. This anime is also the reason I will never even bother to watch shows like Dragon Ball Z or Naruto, because the experience they offer is going to be the exact same, with a ridiculous amount of episodes and godawful pacing with mediocre animation. One Piece didn't start off too bad, actually. From East Blue to Marineford, the show was consistently good. It had its share of fillers and poor pacing, but compared to Post-Timeskip stuff, it's literally a drop in the ocean. The story and characters are a 10, obviously. Each of the Straw Hats are lovable and you have a lot of fun with them. The villains are top notch, and many of my picks for the best anime villains ever come from One Piece alone. The story is excellent as well, it's interesting, it's exciting, and it's extremely emotional at points. The animation is also pretty unique; it still stands the test of time and doesn't look outdated. This holds true, until we get past Marineford and into Fishman Island Arc. Everything took a very sharp nosedive, whether it was the animation quality, the pacing, or the sound effects, it was a major step down from anything Pre-Timeskip. The animation is quite lazy in many places, Fishman and Dressrosa especially. While it's not Seven Deadly Sins Season 3, for a show that rakes in so much money, you'd think they'd at least put in effort for the animation, instead of not giving a shit until a major fight takes place. The animation does get a whole lot better for the most part now that we're in Wano since it's the most hyped One Piece arc ever, but even then it has problems with animation. And everything other problem still holds in the Wano Arc. The pacing is easily the absolute worst thing about this show. They extend every page in the manga for as long as possible to fit the 24 minutes per episode, and it's not uncommon for 7 minutes of an episode to be the OP and recap from the previous episodes. This show recently hit 900 episodes as well, so good luck trying to go through all of it, filler included. Speaking of fillers, they should at least be interesting, in order to justify being in the show despite not being in the original works, but it doesn't even have the courtesy to do that. I did try watching the filler at some point and I've yet to be even remotely interested in any of them. The sound design is also atrocious in the anime, especially in Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island Saga. Every punch, kick, sword slash, and gunshot feel hollow and lifeless, like they're just hitting a tree with a stick, and the OST, while great, is overused a lot in Post-Timeskip. The voice acting is fine for the most part, but there are certain characters where they're simply too over-the-top to take seriously and you're just annoyed by them. The running sounds are what irks me the most; does everyone wear tap dancing shoes or something?! Shit grates my ear every time someone walks or runs, it's infuriating. I'm only following the anime now because I'm such a huge fan of the manga and Wano is indeed hype AF but man, this series really deserves better than the anime. 4.5/10",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 21, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_870f4c924b,36
"Brazilian version:: Para o gênero shounen, One Piece tenta inovar ou trazer alguma mudança no meu ponto de vista. A temática pirata, se encaixa muito bem, isso sem exagero. Além disso os personagens, podem ser marcantes, emocionantes, carismáticos entre outras características. Em geral, durante o anime tu vai se lembrar e relembrar deles e não do jeito que pareça muito forçado para quem assiste. As ilhas e o universo de One Piece e muito bem construindo, tirando a parte da ilha dos homens peixes e outros arcos secundários que são mais para passar o tempo. Retomando aos homens peixes, o criador Eiichiro Oda, simplesmente não trouxe aquele espirito de que o ""Novo Mundo"" seria desafiador, foi um arco só para mostrar que os personagens eram fortes e que tinham ganhado melhores habilidades, foi muito fraco esse arco, se quiserem podem ler o mangá que é mais rápido. Mas, tem boas notícias o arco de wano, o arco atual, tá sendo incrível tanto no mangá quanto no anime, um arco pra dizer que o novo mundo não é brincadeira e que se você estivesse passando nesse momento, nessa ilha, iria ser a pessoa mais corajosa e forte que iria conhecer e pagaria uma bebida num bar.

The islands and the One Piece universe are very well built, except for the fish men island part and other secondary arches that are more to pass the time. Returning to fish men, creator Eiichiro Oda, simply did not bring that spirit that the ""New World"" would be challenging, it was an arc just to show that the characters were strong and that they had gained better skills, this arc was very weak, if wish they can read the manga which is faster. But, there is good news, the wano arc, the current arc, is being amazing both in the manga and in the anime, an arc to say that the new world is no joke and that if you were passing by right now, on this island, it would be the bravest and strongest person I would ever meet and buy a drink at a bar.

"Summary at the bottom if you dont wanna read all this warning: spoilers General review introduction: I started watching OP a bit over 3 months ago and I have around 40 eps left until I get caught up at the time I'm writing this. Disclaimer: One Piece is my favorite anime and favorite show of all time so I might be a bit biased Story: Incredible. On the outside it might seem really simple; the classic shonen story of some kid who wants to be the pirate king or fifth hokage or whatever, but theres actually a deeper, much more interesting story behind all that. It takes a few hundred episodes for it to fully reveal itself fully, but there are hints at the overall story starting as early as Alabasta with the introduction of the Poneglyphs. It's been 20 years and we still don't know the full story yet, but we have the basics. Art: For the first 200 eps or so the art style and animation is not nearly as good as it is today, but it was made a long time ago so its not really a big deal. You get used to it really quickly and once it turns HD it gets a lot better, but gradually gets better before that as well. It really reaches its peak at Wano Kuni Arc (890-) where it looks absolutely amazing and it really brings out the best in all the characters. Sometimes, fight scenes were slightly monotonous and (rarely) a chore to watch, but in Wano its never boring due to the incredible animation and colors that are always blasting across the screen at any moment. It's on par with ufotable's KNY, and thats saying a lot. Sound: OST is fire, gives me chills sometimes, the OPs are all great but my favorite is hands down Fight Together. Character: Really good. Enies Lobby, Whole Cake Island, Thriller Bark, Drum Island, Alabasta, and pretty much all of the arcs have one character or Straw Hat member at the center of them, and each of these makes you like them so much more. Before Arlong Park I fucking hated that bitch Nami, but now I don't hate her (shes still my least favorite member though). Before Whole Cake I didnt really like Sanji that much because of that one time he told Jimbei to kill himself because he indirectly caused Nami pain. Which is bullshit. But WCI made me like him a lot more. OP is great at making you care about characters and making them endearing and interesting. Enjoyement: If I didn't enoy this show I wouldn't have binged almost 950 eps of it in like 3 months, It's fucking awesome, you should go watch it if you haven't its worth it. OVERALL (SKIP HERE) One Piece is the best anime I've ever seen. It makes me cry, laugh, and it sends chills down my spine. Sometimes it does that all in the same episode. I truly believe that the Summit War Saga is a work of art. It has a perfect balance of horror (sabaody), comedy/fanservice (amazon lily), comedy/suspense (impel down), and an epic action filled war (marineford). Those 100 or so episodes made me realize how great OP was and secured its eternal #1 spot. If you haven't seen One Piece yet you definitely should.",10,Recommended,"Aug 12, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7ba107294a,36
"My only ever completely biased 10/10 across all boards, One piece is simply my favorite anime of all time. OP has enough fanfare surrounding it so I'll spare the individual criterions that encompass my score. Instead, let us address why it gets low scores from some people in the first place. I am well aware of the flaws; the art is odd to some, the presence of the shounen recap syndrome of wasting the first five minutes behind the flashbacks, extending scenes that weren't so dragged out in the manga, its gigantic length compared to most anime etc. Now, the thing is most people that criticize OP are manga readers and/or people scared of the length. No matter how amazing the manga is, the anime was what got me into it. That alone deserves the score I gave it. For people with the length issue, I can guarantee they heard sth along the lines of ""it gets better at around episode so-and-so."" I loved OP from the very first episode. Like I said, I'm heavily biased. Skipping the first 5 minutes is natural to me. I never skip the 2 minute long openings because I love the foreshadowing. I watched every filler as well, and I liked them all. What can I say, I've been hooked from the start. And as for it being dragged out more than the manga, I don't have the time in my busy schedule to stay up-to-date, so the anime is the only way I get to experience it. Once an arc finishes airing I binge the whole thing then put in on hold till the next one ends, as such length is never a problem. The longer the better, why would I want the fun to stop? What I'm saying is, I love it so much that I adapted to its flaws. Maybe that's what we should strive for really, to find sth we love no matter what flaws it has; to be truly content in love. If you are interested to find out why I say this, maybe try watching a few eps, no pressure. You don't HAVE to like it, but you will miss out if you don't, that I can assure you.",10,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ca3c326b4f,36
"When it comes to One Piece you either love it or you hate it with a passion. I'll be the first to admit that as a huge fan of the series its not the best shounen of all time but it's still a really good show nevertheless. One of my very few complaints about the show is how after over 20 years a lot of the sound effects are basically the same with a few new ones added during certain scenes in specific arcs like it shouldn't be that hard to find or create new ones from time to time, another one of my complaints is more aimed towards anime fans than the actual show itself and that's that people are immediately put off because of the insane amount of episodes it has. The power system I personally think is one of the most unique I've seen in anime in a long time, I often catch myself wishing I had a certain Devil Fruit that is super OP. The characters are also really unique I mean like Luffy has a Cyborg, a dead body and even a blue nosed reindeer that talks on his crew, each crew mate has their own role to play and their interactions with each other are sometimes absolutely hilarious. I could easily recommend this anime to anybody as long as you have the patience to get through the boring parts. I've found myself getting attached to certain characters really quickly and have grown to love them more and more every time I see them on screen. I don't have much else to add other than if you've been putting off watching or reading One Piece you should just do it because you won't regret it and even though it might get boring it tedious in the beginning it gets a lot more interesting later on. TLDR: You will either love it or hate it but you should at least give it a try before deciding you hate it because of the amount of episodes.",9,Recommended,"May 2, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_16d2a969cd,36
"Hey, what's up? This is a One Piece midstream review. Taking time out around the time-skip to review OP once and for all...until it ends? In 2035? Or doesn't end. We don't care, this story doesn't have to end for it to be important. So, you're wondering, should I watch OP? It's too long, maaaaan! I get it, it IS too long...of enjoyment. It's filled with gutbusting laughs and hurrah moments and manly manliness. I get it, we don't have time, it's hundreds and hundreds, a THOUSAND episodes! I can't take this, I really can't take this. You don't have the right, oooooh you don't have the right. I get it, life is short, why invest time in this longass anime? Ain't nobody got time for that, I'll keep it simple and watch Naruto instead. However, let me let you know that this is in fact a priceless piece of @ss and you're staring at it all wrong. ""Oh, it's just about little kids, I can't stand that, drop it in the first arc."" Yeah, little kid fillers in anime are annoying to me too. And the manga doesn't really go anywhere from the start either. That's where I began, the manga, and I didn't get it at all. I talked about how much I didn't like it, maybe I was obnoxious, I really hope I was. Little kid fillers suck in OP, Naruto, pick your poison. And yet...we're telling A STORY. I get it, it's hard to get into this world. It really is. You're reading this and you're jealous of those 90's Japanese people who had the sophistication to read OP on a train and dedicate themselves to all the stories it was telling. It's 2022! Ain't nobody got time for that. I get it. And yet...when it catches, IT CATCHES. I get that people say Arlong Park is the one. For me, in the manga, it just wasn't for me. Why is every story about little kids? Who is LUEFFY? Why do I care about this island and the fruit Nami is trying to grow? Doesn't make any sense. Truth be told, you had to have a lot of patience. And I think OP got enough chances that it eventually started to become a really good story. It could've been cancelled early on, and you never would've heard of OP, but Shounen Jump gave it enough chances. This is why you don't give up on an artist until you have to. Have a little faith. Especially in your taste in artists, of course. So yeah, this story starts out rough, that's for sure, in the manga obviously. But then, I like anime, I watch anime, the anime is incredible, and that's where it started to truly turn around for me and the vision of Oda-sensei became obvious. I don't know why the manga never clicked for me, but as soon as the anime became bingeable on Netflix, I knew I had to give this series another chance. I don't know why, it just dug at me that I'd never been able to sync with one of the biggest deal animes of all time. So many fans, it felt like an underground club. And it had 1000 eps! I must've been missing something. The manga for me moves far too slow, has way too many little kid backstories, and never gains any kind of momentum. It's a very slow subway line page turner. It's for guys who are bored reading Jump and just so happen to need something to look at and OP just so happens to be there. It's not as good, or flows as well, or gives immediate satisfaction the way Hellsing, Ranma 1/2 or Black Lagoon do (the manga I most want to see back in print). But manga is slow, it is traditionally slow. The big turning point for me was obviously Little Garden, that's the arc where I started to see the forest for the trees and became intrigued. Something about that arc was much bigger, much more masterful than what had come before, this is where Oda started to master his story and a line of imperceptible...something, became obvious. We could now see a clear trail of where this story was headed. Pirates? On an island? And giants? It's so obscure, it belongs in some aristocrat's logbook from the 1700's in France or Germany. And yet...what is it about this story? I thought to myself. So that's 70 episodes in. I know you'll complain, ""That's too loooong! Raaaagh! No time for anime, gotsto go to wooooork!"" Like some shounen jump character, I get it, that's a lot of episodes. Gintama is kind of the same way. Long running shounen series take time. Not every series starts off as exciting and interesting as the iconic Naruto.... And yet, while Naruto's beginning is FAR better than One Piece and far more accessible, especially to westerners who will recognize the storytelling conceits right off (a young boy is isolated and must fight as an individual to gain respect from his senpai and peers), OP is a long, slow churning series. This is a guy pushing a boulder up a mountain, no doubt about it. And as a western individual, you won't recognize the collectivist emphasis on 'friends'. That will be confusing. OP is purely collectivist from the start, while Naruto starts individualist and is always redeemed by 'friends' and collectivism and falls into the trap of collectivist story tropes late in its run, to its detriment. I get it, Naruto has a far better beginning, so does Death Note and so does Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bleach had a few really good episodes as well. I get it, everyone gets it. What is it about OP and long running, grueling shounen series? I get it. But while Naruto, DN and Fullmetal start off really great, their issues become enhanced the longer their series go on. Naruto becomes 'talk-no-jutsu', which might be the greatest criticism against a fictional story ever levied. Fullmetal loses the drive of its narrative arc as its baddie becomes too overpowered and then too underpowered in a couple of quick moments and all the long storytelling is destroyed before you even remember how good it was. DN falls apart as soon as its chief protagonist dies, to the utter detriment of the story and its hype. OP starts off goofy, it should not have been the one, but it is. And it is probably because OP starts off so goofy from nowhere and has so many little kid backstories that its lore is built to a chillingly complete level that most manga outside of Berserk never reach. Because as we all know, the pinnacle of storytelling in manga and anime resides in 'hang out stories', where the characters aren't forced to be action stars and can just breathe and be themselves and explain who they are, this is OP's strength, its ultimate strength, its characters feel like real people. Before Luffy ever goes to a castle to save anybody, you understand who that character is. We know Robin, we get to know Nami, we know Tony Chopper and Frankie. OP bores you with backstories other shounens never would, but in the process you gain something richer. In its first seventy episodes, Oda lays a backstory so rich and fine that it's only later that you appreciate the scale of what he is doing. Luckily for you, there is an anime, with a fine, fine dub, and many, many episodes to binge at a moment's notice when you do really get into this story, with very fine animation. The animation is akin to Miyazaki's glory days, the classic Nausicaa/Nadia/Castle of Cagliostro style, green grass, blue skies and a little bit of hazy mystery on the horizon. It's way better than Pokemon but it's still the classic Japanese art style. Green fields, blue, blue water, big smiling, expressionful eyes and lips. Big hair, it's a basic, classic style, simplistic but it has always done the job in animation. It doesn't try to do too much animation wise, only giving us what we need. Which is why it is so remarkable, peak OP is like Miyazaki fell asleep and you smoked a pipe containing the essence of his very best works, like Totoro or Mononoke, or Spirited Away, and just got carried off to dreamland. Like he's the caterpillar and you're Alice, and you're just carried off to Wonderland. It has many notes and influences from Miyazaki and basically interpolates his style as 'the main style of anime'. Which is why OP reminds you so much of the best Miyazaki movies all the time. There's constantly moments where you take a second to recognize the natural beauty of areas which Oda has built. This foreground is part of what makes OP special. There are so many pretty landscapes like the Grand Line's cliffs, or Sky Island, or Drum Island or Sabaody. Hundreds of eps in you might be tempted to say it's all the same, but I never stop appreciating the Miyazaki notes in the landscapes. Natural, beautiful, unspoiled, the way it should be, a paradise, nature before man ruined it. It opines for something better. Thus OP becomes like a post-Miyazaki paradise. Its characters are special as well, but I won't spoil you. Suffice to say, OP is extremely special and there's a reason it is the TOP anime and one of the best stories going. If you're going to endeavor One Piece, it will take time for you to graft onto the story. I wasn't captured on Oda's entire vision at Arlong Park or anything until his writing started to become one-world traditional. In so many words, One Piece started to carry notes and spice from many classical stories that made it really accessible to me. It felt like fairytales with pirates, fairytales from childhood. That's when I started to realize the enormity of the thing. Little Garden was the start of that. Until then we have some baddies here and there, like Whiskey Peak, that allude to something bigger. But you don't get an idea of how big the world is, nor is the World Government solidified until later. But who knows? Maybe if you start with the anime then everything will click early on, but in the manga I definitely felt lost, even on Baratie with Sanji I had no idea what was going on or why. Basically what I would say to you is, East Blue is tough to get through, that is Oda laying the foundation of his plan and a lot of the time it's like watching paint dry. No doubt, it's a tough first part of the story. It's not like Death Note, Naruto or Bleach, it doesn't come in bombastic, flashbombing you with an interesting backstory. OP starts off more innocent. I would argue that Oda was finding his sea legs. OP legions will stand up and shout that Oda had it all planned out from the beginning and it was always a masterpiece, but I beg to differ. Things were shaky at the start. So for westerners, that's going to be hard to take, that this story doesn't hit you from the start. There's no death pen, or scoundrel in the village living on his own and being abandoned by everyone, there's no sexy older woman living in the cupboard of your bedroom, there's no vampires or biker chicks with guns. OP is a much more peaceful series, out on the seven seas, away from all that. At its heart, One Piece is about peace. That's going to be tough for westerners to take. More often than not, dudes are just chilling or having frank discussions about this or that. There is no bombast, there are no big bads from the beginning. Dudes are just lazing around, chilling, sailing or talking crap. East Blue is okay. OP doesn't become OP until the Grand Line, that's where OP really starts to take off. The question is if you have the patience to get through East Blue to Arabasta and the Grand Line around sixty eps in? Which you should, because OP is a masterpiece and you know around ep 180ish that OP is a masterpiece that will keep on giving. Is it the GOAT? Yes, probably, now that Berserk will go unfinished, OP is right there with Berserk, except it has an anime and a great dub and amazing music. The openings are always so danceable. I would recommend getting into OP immediately, the story is incredible, the characters are amazing and everyone in this story becomes like your own family. Heck yeah I recommend OP. One Piece after the Grand Line starts is basically like watching a movie all the time. The pacing only has issues if you're watching week to week. Otherwise, the anime is way better than the manga. I just couldn't ever get into it very well. But maybe the manga gets really good around the Grand Line as well. Yes, I would put in the work, get through the East Blue saga over 60 episodes and start really enjoying one of the greatest anime series of all-time from Grand Line on. Ranking the arcs: All>East Blue, to start. Among the fantastic arcs, which is everything after East Blue, the only one that is less than perfect is perhaps Thriller Bark. The rest are excellent to perfect, and Thriller's dumb baddie is the only real issue, just because he's kind of lame. Once you get through East Blue this story is kind of masterpiece after masterpiece. If you sat through EB I'm not sure anybody couldn't enjoy Arabasta, Sky Island or Water 7. It's like if someone made a long anime series out of all the best Miyazaki films, it's that good. It has the same kinds of values in my opinion, friends, companionship, love, the good normie ones, with the same kinds of backgrounds and good characters. One Piece is an anime that truly lives up to the legends of before, who made anime what it is today from the '70s, '80s and '90s. It gives you everything you ever wanted and is very pure. True, there is no romance really, no adult themes like Black Lagoon or Hellsing. But it is a palate cleanser. The true themes of One Piece are far bigger and more universalist than you could ever hope to imagine. Eventually you realize that OP is a political anime about the evils of neoliberalism. The pirates symbolize the hope for freedom and the chaos that ensues without order. The navy represents the lie of justice and the fact that crime will always be rampant. The world nobles are an evil class of aristocrats protected by the navy who think that they're serving justice. One Piece is about a world whose laws and customs rely on lies rather than truth, obfuscation over simplicity. While pirates represent chaos they also represent man's wish to be free. The navy represents man's wish to repress the desires of the middle class and rule over them with an iron fist and steal the proceeds of their hard work. I would not say OP is communist or egalitarian. Rather it represents the need for individuals to feel needed, respected and required, rather than discarded, repressed or oppressed. While it has many collectivist sentiments like its emphasis on 'friends', its emphasis is really on community overall. Trusting, feeling safe in, and requiring community that is respectful towards the individual. OP does not respect law and order without generosity or care. Luffy does not respect a lawman who is corrupt, fat, docile or feeding off the classes he or she oppresses. Luffy stands for freedom and justice. This is very different from every other shounen anime. OP actually has values which only become apparent later on in the story. The World Government seems increasingly evil. It represents the ambition to 'MASTER' man and make SLAVES of the lower classes and EXPLOIT the lower classes for all proceeds of THEIR work. It really is that simple: man's dominion over man, due to values one invents upon one's birth: intelligence, class, access to special education or certifications and licenses, entitlement, the profundity of wealth over the work that actually achieves the ends which humanity requires to obtain a society. What is the World Government except parasites on the system? Snatching their own share from a system they have produced no profit in? Luffy is a black eye on all of that. Luffy only respects certain values, though even at Marineford, he could not save those closest to him against a system which uses immense strength to achieve its ends. The strawhats bully friend and foe alike if they fall on the wrong side of the path of true justice, which means accountability and honesty. They never have the time or patience for those who would bring ruin to others for their own profit. And that's what makes them so heroic. At the middle point, OP is a dang masterpiece. There's absolutely no doubt. If you're looking for something a little more adult in certain attitudes then it is never going to satisfy you. But anyone who watches OP has no doubt, hundreds of episodes in, that what they are seeing is like a culmination of decades, fifty years of anime. And in many ways it is peak anime, because its values are so universalist. Luffy stands against corruption, he believes in the dignity of every individual and protects them against a system that means to do evil and harm to others. Should you watch OP? Of course you should, it's one of the essentials. Does it take some time and appreciation from a distance to understand where it's going? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean the work isn't worth it. When OP hits for you finally, it will hit hard.",10,Recommended,"May 4, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6335f83768,36

"to be honest i was gonna wait until im caught up to write a review but I just finished marineford and I really cant not talk about it! My reviews are usually straight to the point and I don't analyse the story or anything too much so I will try not to give spoilers so feel free to read this if you are unsure about weather or not to start one piece. Now I know there are many views on this show but from my experience 90% or even more of the people who have actually seen one piece, love it! i have had people stop half way or stuff but everyone I have asked who has seen it say they enjoyed the show or are enjoying the show even now. Its why I started watching it 4 months ago. i have also heard from people who know nothing about one piece as to how bad it is? or people who watched like couple episodes and dropped it, don't listen to them like at all. I am trying not to be biased here but one piece has become my all time favourite anime in a matter of 4 months! Its more than an anime for me at this point because the way i see it is that I'm not watching an anime but on a journey with these guys. I never gave a fuck about world building and always focused on character building however...ONE PIECE DOES BOTH SO WELL! so what if its long? HECK I DONT WANT IT TO END! oda is one of the best writers of this generation because of how wonderfully one piece is crafted. The show comes off as if its for kids but its so much more, the themes of politics, justice, slavery, corruption, good, evil...its all there. its done in a way where you yourself look at it and are in shock as to how easy it is to potray these things in a way that doesn't come off preacy or cringy. It took me till the marineford arc to realise how i have been sucked into this world because of the world building and like it all comes together so well especially in this arc. I wont make this too long but characters i have to talk about. Many people tell me they don't like the design especially in the older arcs to which i say...fair. When i first watched one piece i personally loved the art style but i know some people may not but that should not stop you from appreciating the DEPTH EACH AND EVERY CHARACTER HAS!. i am going to ignore the fillers and anime canon and talk about the canon episodes ofc that is written by oda. EVERY CHARACTER even like the side characters provide so much depth not to the main characters but to the island or the world itself. I So many things in the first arc are still relevant later on. But it doesn't seem repetitive at least to me it just works. ALSO LUFFY! the best mc in an anime i have ever seen like...i honestly cant explain it in words but fluffy has every quality of an mc at the right amount where he doesn't come off as fake but someone real after a certain point. i think even the people in the anime are at first like ""whos this dumb kid"" but every person and i mean everyone he interacts with or whoever sees him in actions, grows to respect him because he has the qualities of a captain and a great anime mc. I really have so many things i can talk about but i don't want to make this long so i will just say please give one piece a try. this anime is not over rate or over hyped it deserves every single praise it gets because every part of this anime (except for the pacing lol that i agree but you have to push through taht) is flawless. I watched one piece one day coz i was like eh why do people like it so much, i cant judge it without watching it and here i am almost half way...part of the strawhats for life!",10,Recommended,"Nov 14, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d786ce194f,36
"I'm gonna keep this review really short since I'm by no means an expert anime reviewer. There are two types of people in this section reviewing one piece: those who hate it and those who absolutely adore it. I have read some reviews and by far I see that most people's problems were: animation issues, pacing issues and art issues. I'm here to address those issues and explain why they haven't affected me that much at all: Animation: I honestly didn't really notice any issues with the animation to be honest, since I'm a casual viewer. And I'm sure that most of us watching anime are casuals, we don't dwell deep into this stuff so it doesn't really affect us in any way. Back in 2015, when Dragon Ball Super was still airing and had terrible issues with the animation, I still didn't notice any problems with the animation, even when I was watching the infamous episode 5. Pacing: Honestly, when you're binging episodes back to back, the pacing doesn't really feel that bad, at least not to me. I could feel on some episodes that they were being dragged out way too long but when you're binging, the feeling quickly goes away and honestly didn't affect me at all. I guess this problem will be really bad now that I have caught up but that still doesn't matter because I have moved on to the manga as of episode 932. Art: The art is great. I don't know what people are talking about honestly. I was also guilty of hating one piece for the art back then but the feeling quickly disappears a few episodes in. Especially in the recent Wano arc, the art work and animation have been really great. I have also seen people having problems with the facial expressions of people crying in one piece, saying that it's ugly. In my opinion, it isn't ugly at all, it feels real and emotional and I personally don't have any problems with it.",9,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33718bd053,36
"One Piece is like a roller-coaster ride of emotions. The characterisation and my favorite thing about One Piece is the wonderful worldbuilding. I personally prefer the Manga over the Anime. But, the anime has given brilliant Shounen Arcs such as: Marineford Arc and Alabasta. The only thing I don't like is the fillers. It also has Doflamingo, one of the most underrated anime antagonists of all time. Tbh, The series has made me cry alot. One Piece definitely deserves all the recognition it gets. 9/10 at best for me.

"One Piece, definitely one of the best animes ever. 1014 Chapters and 976 episodes at the moment. If you haven't watched One Piece yet, I suggest you start now. GREAT beginner anime, you can never go wrong with any anime in the big three. Great world building and character development, really outstanding. Pacing in the anime might be bad in some arcs but everything else really compensates, there are only two arcs I would rate under a 7 and those are Skypiea and Fishman Island. Greatest arc of all time is Marineford and soon might be Wano. Wano is insanely well built up, has been the goal since post timeskip, around 400 episodes ago. Low filler rate of 10% and might have the greatest main character out here. Favorite character is Bon Clay ofcourse hehe, if you are reading this and just started the anime, goodluck on your journey!

"I honestly really love One Piece!! I put off watching for a long time because of its length but I am so happy I started watching. One Piece has easily become my favorite anime. The is not much that I can criticize. The art is not my favorite but I got over that fairly quickly because of the story line. I do not think I have seen another story like this in an anime or really any other way and I think it is very unique. The reason I give the show a 9 and not a 10 is because of the homophobic and fatphobic coding. I believe that those codings are very dangerous and damaging for those communities. The coding also ruined some of my comfort characters for me. Other than those things I truly adore this anime and I say that as a fat gay. This may not bother other viewers but for my self this coding is unnecessary and damaging. If the show did not have this aspects I would 100,000,000% give this anime a 10 rating.",9,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f6348d30c5,36
"first of all: The German first OP is completely different and it slaps! I have been starting one piece and I am loving it so far! As I was watching it in german I noticed now that the japanese opening is completely different not only the lyrics but also the song itself! But I am happy to see the german version because I like it more. If you're interested check out for yourself! I am currently on episode 9....it's a long way to go... I love one piece because it seems like a veery nice adventure (and it is going to be a loong one;)) and I am sure we are going to see a lot of new friends and enemies on the way, ah I just know I will enjoy it! as for the main character luffy (Ruffy in german) is always having a smile on his face and that determination - I bet this is going to be even better than naruto... Let's see. I am happy I have FINALLY started this anime! It has already been too long I have waited because there are 1014 episodes already and I thought that would be too much - but why not watching a anime that started airing when you were born? Just incredible imo.",9,Recommended,"Apr 19, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eb4bb55ae9,36
"The pacing is kind of bad but once you finish it you feel like you need to watch the next episode. Many scenes were iconic definitely watch it and read the manga too.for me it's 10/10 the current arc definitely has a lot of plot twist after the oden backstory.I think i understand why people say it's long because there is a lot of filler episode and the pacing is slow it's definetely has a lot of memories for me Over all it's worth watching and reading One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.",10,Recommended,"May 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0bfca80105,36
"Ill try to make this review quick, and on point. Please note, that its just my subjective point of view. Nothing much to say, great anime. A lot of action, great art and amazing characters. What do I think about Story of One Piece: Story is definitely top notch. There is no way to experience story that well written in any other anime or manga. What do I think about Art of One Piece: Art of One Piece is rather subjective topic. Some people love it, some people hate it. For me the art is absolutely stunning, especially after timeskip. What do I think about Sound of One Piece: Great Openings and Endings, voice acting on point and amazing in fight sound effects. What do I think about Characters of One Piece: Interesting personalities, relations between characters gradually changing over time. Simply 10/10 What do I think about Enjoyment of One Piece: Anime for me is undeniably enjoyable.",10,Recommended,"Jul 30, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8a5550e5fc,36
