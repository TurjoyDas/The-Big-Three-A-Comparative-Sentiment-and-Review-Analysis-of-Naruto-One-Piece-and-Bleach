"In 2012, Bleach ended its long anime-run without adapting the final arc from the manga. Dubbed as part of the 'Big 3', it almost felt like an end of an era. Some fans were left confused that the anime omitted its final arc although it's understandable that the manga was still ongoing at the time. Almost 8 years later, Bleach's massive 20th Anniversary Event breathed new life into the franchise as we got the final arc anime announcement: Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War. Mind you, this isn't just an announcement for what fans wanted after all these years. It's a celebration for the entire Bleach fandom. Tite Kubo has amassed a loyal fanbase and I confidentally say that he deserves it for his creative vision and sheer determination. Initially, he didn't expect Bleach to bloosom into the franchise as we know today but mangaka Akira Toriyama provided the encouragement for him to succeed. Tite Kubo's creative vision to make characters dressed up in kimono and supernatural monsters associated with spiritual themes is what made this franchise so special. Of course, he was influenced by other works but Bleach still stands out as a very special show on its own. And with the final story arc, this served as the ultimate sendoff for anime viewers who had hoped to see this one day. Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War is based on the final story arc of the manga, pitching Ichigo Kurosaki, the Soul Society, and his allies, friends against a new enemy known as the Wandenreich. They make an immediately impact by disposing a lieutenant and challenges against the very best of Soul Society. Led by the Quincy King Yhwach, their true agenda remains a mystery but it's clear that they are a prominent threat against all of Soul Society and the human world. Even the world of Hueco Mundo isn't safe from their wrath as Ichigo and his allies decides to take a stand against this new threat. Watching the Thousand-Year Blood War Arc immediately shows just how dangerous and capable the Wandenreich is with their special abilities, equipment, and ruthless ambitions. While not much is known about their, some of their members display a malevolent aura that borderlines on a God-like complex. If there's anything Bleach has taught me about its antagonists, it's that they often come across as charismatic characters such as Sosuke Aizen and the Espadas. While we don't know much yet about Wandenreich, it's clear that they a force to be feared. Our oranged hair main protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki is still the same Shinigami we came to know since previous seasons. Joining him in his quest to stop the Wandenreich includes his loyal friends such as Rukia, Renji, Yasutora Sado, Orihime, and of course, the Soul Society. The oddball of this show is Uryu Ishida, because of his status as a Quincy, and this is a source that gets complex this season. Unfortunately, this season doesn't truly dive into Uryu's motivations or what his true purpose is yet. Most interestingly however, we come to know a deeper background story of a few Soul Reaper captains including Genryuusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Retsu Unohana. Even Ichigo's parents gets a spotlight this season as we come to know how Isshin and Masaki met in their past. It's important because Bleach has a large cast of characters and we can easily get lost. This season took its time to give these characters more meaning with their stories. But fear not, other favorite characters in the franchise also makes a return including Toshiro and Byakuya. They've received storytelling about their backgrounds in the past before so this season mainly reminds us how strong they've become. Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War is exactly how it sounds, a war with bloodshed and been in the making for a thousand years. Narratively driven, this arc goes to show the importance of how the past can affect the future in the Bleach world. It goes to say that with every story arc, there's usually some sort of main antagonist but also lessons to be learned. Ichigo has learned a lot from his first days as a Shinigami and this season will he will learn again what it means to be one. Watching this series serves as a celebration and ultimately, a way to give fans back what they've wanted all these years. Despite the near decade long absence on television, studio Pierrot knew it had to step up and deliver this arc to its eager fans. Thankfully, the quality of this season received a well-deserved upgrade. Character designs looks like it got a next generation upgrade with their detailed outlines and expressions. Battles scenes have been enhanced to bring the fights alive from the manga. Most importantly are the way this season adapted its character emotions. There are several episodes where we see how characters are pushed to their limits when emotions take over. This season captures the essence of those emotions at their fullest. Similar, the theme songs and battle soundtrack still remains stellar like the old days. You can say whatever you want about the Bleach but the the music has always been top tier class for this franchise. Bleach is a franchise that always stood out with its large colorful cast of characters, themes, and pushes its lore to a level we've fondly remember. This season takes another step forward to showcase the final story arc from the manga. Believe me, Bleach fans have always wanted this for years and this was another one of those cases of 'not if, but when'. The 20th anniversary was the perfect storm to announce this show and since then, we've been graced with one of the most memorable arcs so far in just 13 episodes. Fear not for this is just the first season of the Thousand-Year Blood War arc. There's so much more left to tell and we're only just getting started.",9,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_75d7872628,8
"Even in the best that Bleach has to offer, some still won't be able to appreciate it. It's bad, shallow, no writing..and the nitpicks go on. To those saying nothing is happening at all, are you even watching the show, because a goddamn war is actually taking place, which goes beyond just (oh look..there's a new big baddy now). Where is the worldbuilding or character developement?- some ask....here's the thing its only been three episodes for these things to show up immediately, Bleach doesn't spoonfeed those thing at you right out of the gate. Kubo always liked the ''show, don't tell'' method, so he takes his time with developing characters, forshadowing and worldbuilding. So far most criticisms are: ''Me don't like Bleach, me rate 4.'' Bleach TYBW is by far the most ambitous arc in Bleach. This first cour will contain the first Quincy Invasion of the seretei, which is by far considered by fans of the series as Bleach at its peak. As a reader of the manga I will say that this arc has a lot to offer in terms of character developement/progression, reveals and twists, worldbuilding and fights... a lot of em. The production value of the series is definitily impressive so far, from the visuals, compositing, music, voice acting. Bleach keeps showing that it deserves all the hype and praise it's been getting. Simple as that.",10,Recommended,"Oct 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f7c4a26360,8
"This has been a long time coming. From those who've been with the series from it's start, to newer fans through the years, to finally not only have more Bleach, but to have a continuation and finally an adpation of this long awaited arc that so many fans have craved for, and wanted for so long. How is it fairing up? Let's see... Story and characters: 9 You've seen the comments, you've seen the ratings, you've seen the hype, and the lore, the attention to detail with each and every step. The faithful adaption of it's story and it's context. As I've said, it's as if Bleach had never left us, and wanted to come back to finally showcase it's final arcs in style in animation form. Fans who have long awaited this will be happy about it. The characters are as you'd expect them to be, nothing is out of place in the sense of that they look wrong, sound wrong, feel wrong, it's all done really well, and you'll have a blast with it. Bleach came back and it's here to stay. Art and sound: 9 Honestly, it feels as if Bleach never missed a beat. As if it's come right back from how it was before, but with it of course, a more modern and stylish touch that you would expect from shows these days, but even with that, it doesn't look bad at all. If anything as just stated, it's as if Bleach Looks as it should, if not better, showing already the care and consideration brought into this, they were deadly serious, and not just on the art from. The voice acting is on point, and classic voices you all remember are front and center. Bleach was, and always will be a BIG THREE for a reason. Even now, it's standing above so many other shows, you'll be very pleased to know, it's been continuing right. Watch it when you can, watch all of the Bleach before, or even read it. You'll love it, like you'll love this. I need to say no more than this, this is a great adpation, that you should DEFINITELY be considering, if not watching already.",9,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_5a0b838fb7,8
"This season of Bleach is one that i waited for a long time.The animation is something else, something good.I couldn't wish for a better animation.The story is on track with the manga and it keeps adding new dialogues.This season is for all bleach fans and it is a piece of art. The new characters they have the voice that you expected the to have.To put it simply the voice actors are perfect.But now it really starts the fight, the big fights and i think it will be better than naruto's fourth shinobi war, which i liked that very much.I am a Bleach fans and i know this arc will be the best of the entire series and one of the best this season. Every monday i am excited to see a new episode and i keeps bringing.Always take note that some episodes will be without action, like in all anime we are seeing, but it is worthy.If you like action packed anime, with couple of funny situations, well built characters and well built villains, this season and this anime is for you.",10,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_401ee68530,8
"- I haven't read the manga - I actually took the time to think if what I am about to say is what I actually feel or is nostalgia. I even rewatched the episodes again to confirm this This is my very 1st review to an anime since I joined MAL, I really feel like it deserves it. I will try to keep things short and easy to follow: PROS: - Beautiful animation - Fight scenes are just....on another level. Something AMAZING happens and blows your mind, you think nothing can beat that and BOOM something way better comes out - As I have mentioned, I have not read the manga, but I have read oppinions of the people who did and from what I can tell, they are taking their time with the anime, adding scenes etc. which will improve the quality greatly Every episod is just so full of everything, I feel like I can't even blink or I will miss something important. It absorbs you into it. 7 episodes so far and they all together feel like you watched a trailer. CONS: - This is being brought up by many people, that things feel rushed. I have mentioned this in the PROS, lots of things happen each episode. However, for me that is by no means a con. Look, the anime has only 7 episods, patience is the key, I am sure we will get an answer to all our questions, but in time. Maybe you should wait until it's actually finished airing before watching. - Also related on how fast things are moving, my thoughts are that mate, they need to be quick (the quincy). They need to strike fast, as the opponent does not know what to expect. I mean, sure, they have announced their invasion but that does not mean muchh if you don't know what you are about to expect. Peopple falling left and right is something like a blitzkrieg strategy, they don't want to give the shinigami the time to figure out how their powers work and how to counter them. This is seen like something negative by many people, but again, it's just strategy. As we see in episode 7, the quincy can only spend a limited amount of time in Soul Society. Overall, I do recomand it with all my heart. It's been a while since last time I have been so engaged with an anime. It's just beautiful and it should be appreciated for what it is, but again, might be a good ideea to wait until it's finished airing to watch it, as I strongly believe your enjoyment will be significantly higher.",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_35ec3af034,8
"Bleach fans REJOICE! Being one of the first anime I fully watched, I can thank bleach for turning anime into a passion for me (or maybe not? hahaha), which lead to me loving Japan, and the next thing you know, I have been living there now for a bit and am much thankful for it. Does that make me biased? Hell yes, and aren't we all in some way? Let me pull out a bit of negatives before I fanboy away; Bleach has never been the best in terms of consistent plot, nor has it been with power scaling, and a lot of people would mention that it doesn't have very deeply developed main characters, which I generally agree with (although they do fit with the anime). BUT out of the big three shounen, I would say it has the best ""VIBE"": it has good music, awesome villains and STYLE; no seriously did you look at the DRIP that the characters have? Kubo should really have designed clothing... I am basically stating that, Bleach is a vibe. It helps that I love supernatural settings (hello Yuu Yuu Hakusho) too; I just can't get enough of that sense of ""mystery"" that just pairs well with the music (or maybe it's the music that makes it that way?) and the story in general and it's... uniqueness; and no, not in terms of the generic shonen story, but in terms of the overall feel it gives compared to other shounens. I guess if you don't like it, you just don't get the vibe??? Jokes aside, let's talk about the current anime. I have read the manga until the end and yes there are scenes that I am kind of disappointed that are cut, but in the first place; those were cut because of complaints (from what I have heard, which is second-hand information); consumers are never happy aren't they? Ok, I agree, although I was hype, I feel like the first episode could have been a bit better, and there are bits here and there that I would have changed in the 2nd too (trying not to spoil so won't be too specific), but overall I know this arc is gonna rock and I am sure Kubo is looking at the big picture too; there are a lot of things that will happen, thus some things might need cutting. Even though I am nitpicking, I still think it was pretty well directed and executed overall and I was still hooked. Although the new animation looks beautiful, I am not a fan of the 3d animation they used in the first episode for the hollows. The fights and cleanness from all the rest though compensates totally for it, and we won't be seeing much of it I presume as this arc doesn't contain a lot of hollows. Besides that, Bleach has never looked any better; which I am so thankful for. The music remixes from old OST have been also a hit; the intro is a banger; I feel like bleach never disappoints when it comes to music, I would even come to say that it's the main reason why I truly enjoy the show. Music is completely subjective, but most people I know or talked to all agree that bleach's music is one of the big reasons why people fall in love with it. Some may not like it, and that's fine, surprisingly not all people in this world like chocolate either (weird right??), I wasn't a fan of the hollified remix; but I still think it fit and I am sure it's just a matter of getting used to it. The characters are alsowhat made people stop bleach and made others into bleach fans at the same time. I agree that the main cast is very.... boring?; to a point where it gets pretty easy to know what most of them will say and how they will act at most times, and I am saying this even though I love them (let's exclude Orihime from here hahaha). Their dialogue is pretty easy to guess. This season they haven't seemed to change that much either, but I am liking the tension that stems from Uryu. The side characters and the villains thought? Broooooooooo. My favorite captains are back with style and am happy that you could see them in the first few episodes. I am also super stoked to see the villains in this arc come on air. I am also looking forward to the fights; this is the war arc after all. For me, anime; like any form of entertainment; it all boils down to enjoyment. Even though I have some knicks and knacks, I have never felt this excited again to watch anime; and bleach, even though has never been the best show for me from a critical point of view, has always been the best at hyping me up and getting me excited to watch the next episode; a feeling I haven't felt ever since I was in my early teens, where I would go to school and just think about Bleach all day and would run back home just so I could binge watch it. I rewatched it, even with fillers, and still felt that way the second time and even when reading the manga. Rare are shows, or games nowadays that give me this feeling, and somehow, even through my nagging, I just can't contain my excitement for the next episode of this season.",9,Recommended,"Oct 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_951fe3b4d7,8
"Bleach is back and it is better than ever. The Thousand Year Blood War is for me the second best arc this story has to offer. I know a lot of people hate on Bleach because it's popular. A lot of people are already complaining even though we only have 4 episodes up until now. People are saying it's too fast paced. It's not, a lot of shounen now and in the past just adapt stories way too slow. If it was paced slower it would become boring, like what happened in the original anime. People are saying it's too slow paced and that it's taking too long for the invasion to start. You need build-up before you introduce your villains, you know. People think the fights are repetitive and boring. The fight with Opie is amazing. And yes, Opie suddenly reveals a new ability and to some that might feel like an asspull. But that's what makes the fights in any shounen intresting. New techniques and enemies. Some of the abilities Opie shows are things Uryuu has used in the past. We are only 4 episodes in and let me tell you, there are some amazing fights to come. People find the characters boring. But they're not. I do feel like certain characters could have been used more, but even those characters aren't boring to me. They all add to the story in their own way. Whether that be being useful in a fight or adding comedy to the story or adding humanity to it. People are saying this is just a cashgrab. The anime was always supposed to come back. Plus, most people think that Bleach got cancelled because of low ratings. What financial gain would you have by reviving a dead series, unless it's not actually dead. This video goes more in-depth about why the anime was cancelled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npQvWmqIoAE People are saying Bleach is a boring series. But it is part of the Big 3 for a reason. People liked it back then, it became popular for a reason. People enjoy it right now for a reason. It's entertaining. I know there are a lot of issues with Bleach. I read the manga and I know why people hate certain aspects of it. But the staff is really trying their best with this anime and you can clearly see it. If you are searching for a deep story with a convoluted plot then maybe this is not your cup of tea. But not a lot of shounen is that. Not Bleach or Naruto or One Piece or My Hero Academia or Hunter x Hunter or Jujutsu Kaisen or ... . None of those anime are that. They have a message, they have something that can strike a cord with you. But they not that deep. They are just here to entertain and they are doing a great job at that. I love all those series and out of all of them, I like Bleach the most.",10,Recommended,"Nov 5, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_75a5792bc8,8
"as big fan of this series i love what they done with this arc. they delete all comedy content from the manga and make minor changes, and what we see now is masterpiece. Sounds the ost in bleach series is Fire ,and this arc no doubt is fantastic I LOVE IT. 10/10 art bleach is always known of wonderful animation back days, this arc is worth the wait this gorgeous animation is in next level. 10/10 characters at this point we all know all the old characters and how great they are. for the new enmy so far they only 5 eps we can't talk too much here. but for what we see is well done characters. 10/10 story with 4 to 6 chapters adapt per episode and what we see until now make the story phenomenal. 10/10 overall 10/10",10,Recommended,"Nov 12, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_1d2d9b0df5,8
"6th episode will be the famous ""6th episode"" after next week and probably will hold the ""best bleach episode ever"" title until the end of time. I really can't understand the viewpoint of the people who give mid scores to this anime and say it's cutting a lot of material from the manga, as a person who watched the old bleach and read the whole manga I am really enjoying this ""fast pace"" on the early episodes. It brings this arcs shock effect to the maximum and plus Tite Kubo is in this adaptation people, it's probably the writer's choice to give bleach a fresh, jump start after loads of fillers and silly fights lasting like 5 episodes. Personally, I am really enjoying it so far. So if we are done with these gibberish arguments I would like to point out the things that are going crazy in the anime right now. I am writing this review and only 5 eps are out right now. 5th episode was crazy and like I said 6th episode will be the famous 6th episode after next week and probably will win the ""best bleach episode ever"" title until the end of time. I don't wanna spoil anything., just holding on to your chairs, maintain your blood pressure throughout the episode, and hopefully finish it before dying from joy would be my advice. Soundtrack-wise, I am speechless. Shiro Sagisu was always great but making this soundtrack this good in his sixties is a crime. The way he gives Quincies their brand-new menacing imperial themes, bringing old soundtrack with a new taste and adding his ""epic theme collection"" new tunes every single episode is just.. like I said, I am speechless. I was waiting for a good OST but this one blew my mind and I hope after the first break this season he releases some of the tracks cause I can't wait 2 years to listen to this masterpiece. The animation- is good. I can't say I lost my mind over it, definatly doesn't have the vibe of the old episodes but a new taste of its own and I think that appropriate to the situation Bleach is in right now, like after what, 8-10 years you are animating the last arc of an anime and it looks different. Tho to be honest even in manga the distinction between the TYBW arc and the rest is very clear, at least it is to me. So animation and color palettes are different from old but I don't think they are bad but fitting to the situation at hand. I am sure some will say old was better drawn and some will say new has fluent action, I will say I love both and am very pleased with the animation quality for this arc. Gotta add something about the voice actors real quick, I have 4 issues in mind, first, -Yamamoto's voice actor passed away and the new VA nailed it so that's a relief. -Ichigo's VA has grown old I think, his voice is more crispy, and especially the Getsuga-Tenshou sounds a bit different but I am okay with that right now. -I don't know what happened to Hitsugaya and Byakuya tho. Both have the same VAs but Hitsugaya sounds very deep and Byakuya is just not the Byakuya, he doesn't have that sound in his voice anymore and speaks very casually. I guess the only thing I dislike about the anime at the moment is how they butchered Byakuya's sound with the same actor. Final notes-- Watching Bleach with this new look and fast pacing really is a lecture on ""how you bring a 10-year-old shonen anime to life"" and i think we will be seeing this formula for other old animes in upcoming years. Loving how Bleach proceeds right now and I am very satisfied with the outcome, cant actually wait for the new episodes, it's that good.",9,Recommended,"Nov 8, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_c0bf67066f,8

I love it and recommend it to everyone. I'm looking forward to seeing the main fights of the arc, Kubo said there will be a lot of extra content Is the story unique? If it was predictable, did you enjoy it anyway because you like this genre/set-up? a littele but os shonen Do you think the art style is fitting for the story? Yes Were the characters well-rounded? Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong/smart/stupid?

"There is still so much more to see if you know what happens during the Thousand Year Blood War arc, so I doubt it could be condensed into only 13 episodes. I will say though, from what else has released this year Bleach is leagues beyond a majority of other new Anime out this year. Great designs, fights, OG voice actors, the animation is superb in so many areas compared to something like Demon Slayer (which is still good in its own way). I would recommend Bleach and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners as the two top contenders for this year alone, but again its just getting started 6 episodes deep, still a ton going on, but you know this is gonna be a long and action-packed arc if you've read the manga. Overall, I'm giving it a 10 because unlike other Shonen that have lost a lot of what made them special back in the day (Think about how Naruto has devolved into Boruto), I really only think the only other Anime that can stand the test of time like that is One Piece. In terms of the sub vs dub I think both are great but there's definitely a lot of rust going on with the dub voice actors comparatively to the OG japanese VAs. Johnny Yong Bosch sounds identical and gives the same energy as he did way back in the day as Ichigo, of course, and Chad's voice actor replacement fits superbly but overall I think the sub may be more ideal if you are new to Bleach. Back then, the dub was one of the best around and still holds up, I just think COVID has complicated a lot of the recording process for the dub artists and in Japan it's more intimate (you're required to show up at the studio to record in most circumstances, whereas western dubs you can usually get away with recording at home). It's more of a circumstance of the time we're living in, but it's amazing to see Tite Kubo's work brought to life once more for one final masterpiece.",10,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f5aba3935f,8
"The final arc of Bleach started and honestly a lot of importance has happened to make it worthy a review of the whole thing. This is about the first 3 Episodes and it seems people want to push the hate over the quality of the show. This review will give you a different perspective with foresight about what to happen. These 3 episodes so far where everything and build up with mostly talks giving us information we didnt knew while information we don't know being kept reserved. The pacing is better than in the manga but even with that it took 3 episodes for the set up for the invasion of the Wandenreich, the main antagonist, to finish. The anime is fixing out a lot of content from the manga, most were needless like the interaction between Arrancar and the main cast mid battle against one of the lastest foes. But that can hardly be called a battle since after each attack there were several minutes worthy on characters sharing information. Additional content promised add much either. Uryu and Ryuuken get a scene where they interact and it would seem Uryu would push his dad for more information... sadly we don't see that happen. Thus many of the additional scenes feel welcome. Another needed scene is that is that the whole cast appear to fight a bunch of hollow instead of just Ichigo. Despite being vastly superior, they all use their strongest abilities like Ichigo using his freaking Bankai against to welcome the fans once again. If someone is complaining fanservice just because its dumb ichigo will use it on weaker enemies then they were never fans on the first place. Regarding the infogreat scenes, the viewers are introduced to 2 POV characters who suppose to be fully-fledged Shinigami, did seem to have gotten a briefing about the area they are going to protect like how Ichigo Kurosaki looks like and Spiritual Awareness. The setting is also lifefull. While it was night while the hollows attacked, the explosions and chaos created during the fights did cause a lot of panic. Same in Soul Society where a murder ocurred off screen and we don't see any of it. Also the anime adapted perfectly Kubo's cinematography visually like how Ichigo recalls what Uryu said about the phone call infogreat in the manga, a missing scene in the anime that got so needed to be expanded to safe animation and pace in the runtime. Kubo is apparently involved but a very good scene like that is gone to the heavens. But if you turn on your brain and consume the pretty visuals and excellent narrative, it is easy to get what is going on. Certainly worthy a movie or old style OVA. The opening is also a great advertisement treating characters that do a lot later as important. But the opening and ending songs are amazing. Some redone ost are also good like Number 1 while others like Hollowfied sound better. If you have already read the arc, you are getting much out of it unless you want to see the big scenes animated for which you have to wait at least for episode 4 where the invasion begins. If you are a intelligent consumer, if you like pretty colors... great animation, visuals, complex characters and great story. you have them here If you want something else, then go look for it.",10,Recommended,"Nov 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_5c0c91dc1e,8

From baddass characters to awesome VA's everything about this first cour is splendid. The best thing for me was the quincy king and his subordinates, they were baddass uff, I enjoyed them the most.

"We are back in number one baby! The animation are top tier, the story flow nicely compared to old bleach, people who said it never changed, is just a pure hater of bleach or just didn't watch enough of it. The fights are like Anime movie is superb! Also I like that they didn't hold back on the gore and mature content, I was worried that they will butchered and make it heavenly censored, I'm glad they did not. I think a lot of people will like this even new viewers or just starting their journey on Anime world, a lot of people considered Bleach is the weakest in the Big #3 and I big to differ. I've been watching that Big 3 since I was still in Primary School, and bleach is really the top for me, 2nd Naruto and last DBZ (I don't watch boruto or DBZ anymore) I'm just glad that they didn't destroy Bleach and actually they make it so much better! I'm just sad that a lot of people and a fan of Bleach will never ever see this masterpiece because they are not here anymore. It makes me also think to the people who are waiting for HxH how long it will take.",10,Recommended,"Dec 1, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_e346b771d5,8
"(Technically this is not a review. This is just the words of a Bleach fan.) When Bleach ended nearly 10 years ago and when its manga ended nearly 6 years ago, I was heartbroken probably like every other Bleach fan out there. I was heartbroken because I thought we'd never get to see Thousand-Year Blood War arc on screen. I DID MY WAITING, 10 YEARS OF IT! Jokes aside, the day I thought would never come finally arrived. I just completed it and I still can not believe I actually watched 13 episodes of TYBW on screen. The day the first episode aired, I was afraid that my expectations (due to the long waiting) could never be satisfied but I have never felt so wrong in my life. TYBW exceeded my high expectations and left me craving for more. Amazing animations from character designs to battle scenes, heavy tension from the beginning till the end, bloodbath, amazing flashbacks for characters like Unohana, Zaraki, Isshin and Masaki, Yamamoto and so on. TYBW gave me everything I could possibly ask for, except more episodes but hell, my waiting for the arrival of the continuation of this will be easier now compared to the past because I know it will be here sooner or later. Even though I don't really enjoy shounens that much anymore, Bleach will always have a special place in my heart and I will keep enjoying it even if I'm 60 years old. Thank you Tite Kubo for this amazing work and thank you studio Pierrot for bringing this work into life so brilliantly. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_4bf784adc6,8
"INTRODUCTION I'm a recent fan of Bleach, so much so that just this week I finished Bleach and with the huge hype that was for this new arc I threw myself in head first and I can tell you that Bleach - A Thousand Year Blood War is an inexplicable work of art. Studio Pierrot has undoubtedly done a magnificent job in terms of animating Bleach even from the original anime as well as this new arc that exceeded limits and gave a gift to all the fans who have waited years for this continuation and I am a recent fan. I can understand the passion that Pierrot put here, The animations are magnificent, the soundtrack is spectacular and above all the combat choreography is ridiculously incredible. The story As I'm not a manga reader at least not in this new arc, I'll try to summarize with what we've been presented so far, Bleach Thousand Year Blood War takes place as a continuation of the events of the original anime saga after the Fullbringer arc. We are then presented with a new threat Yhwach ""The Quincy King"" and his Stein Ritter army that comes in search of the complete destruction of Soul Society, and this is a very brief summary so as not to give you the entire plot that is being developed throughout these episodes. Animation As I already mentioned in the introduction, animation is an aspect that Pierrot has undoubtedly put all its passion into, and that passion is visible, all the scenes are impeccable, 3D is used but it is not something strange and ridiculous, but something that it makes the experience even more captivating if seen on high quality monitors, without giving away spoilers I want to give my personal opinion about episode 6 ""The Fire"" which is a superb visual spectacle and which made me ""applaud"" the work put here. Characters Well, Bleach's characters, quite charismatic and incredible, are characters that you can undoubtedly get attached to and all of them with very different characteristics and with a phenomenal presence, I'm not going to lie, I wish there was more emphasis on certain characters than it's been shown so far it's pretty good having some changed looks which I thought was really cool. The Pace of the Episodes Well, as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a manga reader in this arc and I'm just going to stick with what I'm seeing in the anime. There are some animes that don't know how to make an interesting pace, but in Bleach that doesn't happen, since the beginning it's full of action and things happening and that makes the experience so addictive that we don't even realize the 24 minutes of the episode to pass, the estudio knew how to balance the story scenes with the fight scenes very well and applied the BRUTAL soundtracks that make Bleach Thousand Year Blood War a spectacular arc. Conclusion Bleach Thousand Year Blood War is an excellent continuation of what the original anime was and is a love letter to all the older fans of this anime and the more recent ones who have joined this magnificent work of art created by Tite Kubo. And I highly recommend seeing this sequel, it's a superb job by Pierrot and my grade is without a doubt a very high 10.

"Hate or Love Bleach, you cannot deny that Bleach tybw was the perfect adaptation! I waited until the series was completed to rate and give my opinion on the series as a whole. Animation & Art 10/10 - You can tell the love and effort that was put into this arc. Story 10/10 - Bleach has been known for all action and no story, but we got so much revelations, news, lore, flashbacks, and so much more with this arc only. Pacing 10/10 - The problem with OG Bleach was the pacing which is bound to happen with the anime being so close to the source content, but the pacing in tybw was perfect. not too slow but not too fast. Conclusion: I came into tybw not expecting much, but this series blew me! The best return of any anime i've ever seen. I can't wait for the 2nd cour to come this summer.

"Let's get something straight, Bleach as a story and everything about it is not a 10/10. But if we're talking about this season and the medium that is anime and what Pierrot has accomplished, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. The directing, the music (Bleach always had the best bangers of all the big 3), the animation, it's peak anime. Judging just solely off an artistic standpoint Bleach TYBW is what other animes strive to achieve and it might be the nostalgia talking but I don't even care, I have no regrets giving it a 10/10. Bleach was once at the top, beating out everyone and had insane potential. You can tell that the studio and everyone working on this is really passionate about finishing off one of the most iconic anime with the justice it deserves, and as a fan who long awaited for it's final arc to be animated I couldn't be happier with what we got.",10,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_557e24ab21,8
"What's interesting about the storyline The story is definitely not predictable especially for anime onlys, overall for the story it was awesome, sometimes mind-blowing, especially On that one episode was shown, where the Head Captain Yamamoto Shigekuni Genryusai was fighting against the Quincy King, Yhwach, the animation was Top-tier, words can't describe how awesome that episode was, but I can ASSURE you, it was DEFINITELY better than that new season of Demon Slayer (Demons got defeated, u know the scene where demon siblings was in a total defeat, both d£cap!tated, died side by side). The massive plot-twist at the end of episode 9 also caught us all off-guard despite the Head Captain Yamamoto showing-off his enormous and monstrous powers (4 Bankai destroying ""Yhwach"") It was a huge disastrous Brute Force against Brilliant Strategy. the Zangetsu = Not really Zangetsu, but rather, the appearance of the Quincy King, 2000 Years ago, legit I was in a massive shook. Y'all won't believe it, my reaction and legit every youtube reactors faces was in TOTAL DISBELIEF, MASSIVE SHOOK hits us hard. The Animation Quality The animation for the art style IS MOST DEFINITELY fits the story 100%, I even consider it's better than the colored manga, NGL TO Y'ALL.. The visuals, artworks, animation quality is a SPOT ON! To the point where it rivals the Demon Slayer new season's OP animation quality, and don't get me wrong! Both has showed us amazing visuals so far. Not to mention the gore visualized from the very start of the episode to eps 13, the brutality, the gore, ruthlessness of the characters was WILD. 💀 I'd like to name every Dangerously OP, characters with Top-Tier Powers of both Warring Factions. Gotei 13 & their second in Command: 1.The Head Captain (Commander in Chief): Yamamoto Shigekuni Genryūsai, age: over 2 milleniums (+2000 Years Old) Powers: Ryūjin Jakka, the Blade of the Enormous Flame, Bankai: East, West, South & North (details on *spoiler alert* episode 9, old man Yama VS Yhwach) 2. Zaraki Kenpachi (Captain), Dangerous man, considered as one of the 5 Special Threats issued by the Quincy King. Powers: Extremely Durable, Relentless Brutal Strikes, Ruthless Deadly Slashes, Overwhelming amount of Spiritual Pressure, Gets stronger everytime he receives strikes. 3. Kyōraku Shinsui (Lately Appointed Head Captain) Powers: He can teleport straight behind, under, and within enemy's shadows to perform a deadly strike, Dual-wielding Zanpakuto user. Deadly and wide huge scale of Bankai radius. He appears weak but deep down, he's too dangerous and cold-blooded. Bankai: Katen Kyokotsukaramatsu Shinju. 4. Aizen Sōsuke (Currently under 20.000 Year of Sentence). A cold-blooded Four-eyes mf, Zanpakuto: KyokaSuigetsu (Complete Hypnosis); He can put every individuals including those with OP traits under his mirage, fake and full of hypnosis, after making visual contact on his Zanpakuto), he can freely put everybody under complete hypnosis whenever he wills. Has reached a higher type of entity above Quincy, Espada, Soul Reapers, Arrancar & Hollows. 5. Urahara Kisuke (Former Captain put under Exile of the Previous Gotei-13) ALSO considered as one of the 5 Special Threats issued by the Quincy King, Master of Tricks, Urahara Kisuke. Mastered every type of Kido & Bakudo, Possess a very mysterious Bankai (a bizarre and deadly one). 6. Kurosaki Ichigo The characters are nice and well written, especially in the colored manga where the details are included. But when they all comes alive in the anime, everything is absolutely SPOT ON and legit comes out with each characters has their own unique and power traits, from the very Top to Low Tier level. Both factions (Gotei 13 & Sternritter) each with their own crazy amount of spiritual pressures and deadly firepowers (legit I mean, they're like the PHD's when it times to brutal k!llings, relentless ch()ppings, slash!ng their enemies with no mercy nor any remorse was truly horrifying, and I'm being honest with y'all, it could affect you psychologically, mentally and it sticks to your minds once you guys witness the brutality shown in the anime like a super glue. None of us manga readers was expecting the gore, none of us manga readers expected any brutality in this massive 10-years long awaited return, and the victims of those brutalities was visualized so real thanks to the voice actors, the screaming, terrifying high-pitched screaming in agony caught us all manga readers off-guard.",10,Recommended,"Jan 2, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_a96811d1e1,8
"I’ve watched bleach a little in the past but never watched past the soul society arc (which I thought was good). With the announcement of this season, I watched from start to finish in order to catch up and be able to watch weekly with friends. Let me say this…: This is EASILY one of my favourite arcs in Bleach, THE RISK, SENSE OF DANGER, REMIXED OSTs, EPISODE TITLE REVEALS, POEMS, ART DIRECTION, THE SYMBOLISM the list goes on and on!! For those who are saying that “it feels rushed” and “seems boring with boring music and dialogue” I’d say coming off of the previous seasons it does not seem rushed (picking up essentially right where it left off after the fullbringer arc) and pacing has been AMAZING. Fights have been animated beautifully and the stakes are kicked up to 💯 If it’s been years since you’ve watched the previous seasons I’d recommend a recap video on YouTube at least first before diving in. And as for the music??

"Bleach is back, and I couldn't be happier. I had previously watched some anime, but Bleach sparked my interest in both anime and Japanese culture back around 2011/2012. That's why I was so excited to hear about the sequel. I've already finished the Manga, so I know what's going to happen, but that doesn't take away from my excitement. And I was not let down. The story resumes where it left off ten years ago. The entire plot line is typical shonen, so it's a little predictable. But Bleach has a captivating atmosphere, mixed with beloved characters and some comedy relief. And the Thousand-Year Blood War arc has one significant advantage over the prequel. There is no need for filler episodes because the Manga is already completed, so the storytelling is not disrupted. Splitting the entire arc into separate courses benefits another aspect as well. I've always thought that Bleach has some intense fight scenes, and that for the sequel, they had enough time to properly animate them. The fights between Yhwach and Yamamoto, as well as Yhwach and Ichigo, look incredible. It gave me goosebumps, and I didn't look away from the screen for a second (and I'm easily distracted). The entire Anime was then complemented by a magnificent soundtrack, as you would expect from Bleach. Overall, I'm looking forward to the next courses. Even though waiting can be aggravating, I'm confident it will be worthwhile. I had grown tired of anime, but Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen revived my interest in it.",10,Recommended,"Dec 29, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_65a8b26f0f,9

"Good, so to cut the introduction stuff cuz it's boring and everyone knows what the series is about, I just want to say WOW. It never occured to me that I would have reactions like dropped jaw and wide opened eyes, even crying of emotion from an anime. Of course, I cried on many animes, but never on Bleatch and it was not from sadness. My best friend told me about Bleach. Her brother have watched it, she didn't get to (yet), but she bought a set of playing cards with the bleach characters she found in a second hand store. ( i'm hella jealous now). Well after debating on which anime I should start a year ago or so....maybe more...I started Bleach. It was nice I enjoyed It with all the fillers. All of them. Special hate from me to the haters >_< just skip them if u don't like that. After I finished watching the series I tagged it as my favourite anime. I thought It had a nice ending and that was good enough for me even tho the actual happy ending of the manga was not animated. I didn't know much about the manga at the time. When I heard that in 2022 there's going to be a continuing season I was like <oh, okay...so there is a sequel. Nice I'd like to see that> I watched this season and had me literally going crazy. Everything in every single episode was perfect. Especially ep 12 and 13 that I just watched and had me dropping my jaw on the floor. I never thought I was going to like a series so much. I came to the conclusion that Tite Kubo is a freakin' genius. All the entities, the powers, the personalities of the characters he created, all amazed me. I even came to realise that aside from everything, Bleach slays in my heart in comparison to Naruto. Don't get mad at me, I love Naruto with all my might but it is just not the same bread, you know. And I know it is not supposed to be the same. I am not saying that Bleach is better. I just liked it more. But this is my humble opinion, and no one on earth can change it. I kept texting to my bestie after finishing these episodes <IT'S THE BEST. WATCH IT. I'M IN CLOUD NINE! THE BEST SERIES EVER> (literally said this) To conclude cuz I don't want to have you guys bored reading this, no anime is better than another. Why? You may think what I am saying is nonsense. Well, maybe. But not really. Every anime is built different. Created by different minds with different ideas and different visions about life. So we are not to judge on the concept of an art work. Just build an opinion about it and rate it based on our preferences. But never say ""anime x is better than anime y"". Because that is the actual nonsense. Hope you guys enjoyed this review ( if you got to read it till the end please give me a sign. I just want to be heared out). Have a nice life and enjoy the animes you like, stop spreading hate.

"All hail, the best anime of the year! For almost a decade, one of ""big three"" has finally came back with its arc finale. What else to say, every episodes is superb! It still have the impact and entertainment value that I've felt years ago. A Thousand Years Blood War Arc is something that has too many stories to tell and all of it are worthy to be tackled. The one thing I love bleach is that it has an abundant variety of characters that has definetely something big to offer to the story. The only time that Ichigo literally shine from this season is during the last episode since it was all about his families' history. But the rest of the episodes has been well driven by notable characters such as Old Man Yama and Retsu Unohana. I am anticipating more revalations from the anime and hoping that they will not let the fans feel disappointed. There's nothing more to say and I just love that Bleach comeback is being consume by a lot of fans and non-fans on today's generation. Let's meet again on its next season.

"Been waiting for Bleach to continue since the orginal series stopped airing back in 2012. So far TYBW has amazing animation and is more graphic in nature, as compared to the previous series, which fits Bleach very well. That ED on the first episode was straight fire and nostalgic for all the OG Bleach fans. The color scheme of the anime is great as well, with the animation being head and shoulders above what we've seen before in this show. The music is good too, but definitely not as great as the first series. I don't mind them remixing the original songs, but at least make them sound decent. There's one track in particular that adds in a high pitched electric guitar that makes the entire thing sound terrible. Something I'm worried about is the progression of the story, if each season in TYBW has 13 episodes, I hope they have enough time to flush out the entire manga without leaving too much out. In the worst case scenario, I'll end up going back to read the manga but we'll see how it goes. Hopefully the upcoming seasons will build upon the solid foundation this season has layed down. All in all, the updated visuals, characters, and my love for Bleach has carried this season for me.",10,Recommended,"Jan 2, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_4fea73afe0,9
"This is a well produced continuation of Bleach. It seems to stick to the old formula. Writing this at Episode 5, let me summarize what got so far. We've been introduced to a new threat. Kurosaki still is stronger than the average dude there and a needless introduction of well established characters doesn't happen. I conclude, this means it was primarily made for fans of the prequel. If you havent watched that or if you didnt like it, I do not recommend watching this (yet) either. However, if you liked the prequel, you really should watch this. Of course, it suffers from the same issues the prequel had, like waiting for certain characters to make progress when you expect them to, and a lot going on at once at multiple places, which can be annoying/hard to follow but that is part of this show, I guess. Personal recommendation: Wait until it finished airing so you can binge watch it. As you may remember, bleach loves cliffhangers and Episode 5 is a prime example here. We got everything in this episode. Battle, an overall dire situation, a ray of hope, foreshadowing, a character who was unexpected to take the spotlight for the moment and a trigger for the urge to yell ""i need next episode right now"" at our screens. If you feel the need to compare it to the manga, go rate the manga, the page is there and it's all yours. Keep in mind, that this is still the animation, not the source material, of course it is different in places and apparently has a rearranged order of things, so it fits well within the episodes time frame.",8,Recommended,"Nov 7, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_33ecc3f662,9

The final arc is a serious and bloody one, with a lot of fights and the first cour is just a start. Pierrot has done an amazing job in splitting the cours, which will not impact the overall production of the final arc, which resumes after 10 years. The characters became more bold, aggressive and the action sequences were totally heavenly. It feels nostalgic and amazing to see an action battle shounen anime to be back with it's most intense arc.

That's bleach, the series long ended without the continuation in the manga. throwing a bad taste for how rush it is but when it adapt as animation, not only it improve some part of what lack in the material but also blowing all expectation for how good it is! Not only they cut the unnecesary part in the manga but also improve the IMPORTANT moment in the adaptation! When eps 1 came out just be clear, all of you who watch this must be crying alot right? Especially when special ending comes you must be nostalgic the journey of this series comes right? Yeah me too! Not only that, the big moment in eps 6,7,10-13 making it more spotlighted than what people need. But even with cliffhanger in eps 13 it makes all of us excited for july 2023 in cour 2!

Honestly, I am an old fan, I followed Bleach because it was a very interesting and a fresh idea at the time. Sadly, as time was passing, Bleach felt very weird for me and declined a lot. The last chapters felt very rushed and since the end years ago, I felt really bittersweet about everything. It was because Bleach was good, but then I felt it all went to waste.

"I went into this having read the manga to completion years ago, and full well knew what to expect when watching. Despite that I was continuously blown away by how incredible this adaptation was. Studio Pierrot delivered on every front they possibly could've. The animation and visuals are gorgeous, the soundtrack including all of the remixes are amazing, the voice acting (subbed and dubbed) is great, and the addition of new scenes really adds to the experience. If there's one front that the series did struggle with it was how fast paced it was and that leading to some scenes from the original manga needing to be cut. That being said most of what was cut were small gag scenes or ones that don't really add much to the overall story, which results in the more oppressive and hopeless mood that this arc of the story is trying to portray. If you are a fan of the series and haven't completed the manga, I recommend this. If you have finished the manga I still recommend it.

"When I watched Bleach initially in 2016, I fell in love with Kubo's work. The show felt like it had a life of its own, and out of the big 3, it was quickly my favorite, which is why I felt so disappointed when it finished airing. The final episode of the initial Bleach left me feeling extremely discontent. Not only did it not actually wrap up the story because it needed to include the entire final arc, but the arc we left off on was one of the weakest in the series. Looking back on it, I realized my issues with the show. The original Bleach anime could have paced significantly better. Often, episodes would drag out things that didn't need to be dragged out, and on top of that, a large amount of poorly written filler added to my distaste. The Bount Arc, for example, was one of, if not the worst, story arcs I have ever watched in all of fiction. The anime's presentation significantly hindered its phenomenal music and well-designed characters. The action, which gave off an air of intensity in the manga, was dragged out to a point where it became almost boring. So what did the new Bleach anime change that makes it so good? It's easy; they cut out all the bullshit. Thousand Year Blood War cuts out all the extra crap and gives us just the story. Bleach is a manga masterpiece, and the only thing holding it back in the past was its poor pacing and disgustingly lousy filler. Without that, the story is very well written. The anime stays utterly faithful to the source material, and because of that, it feels much more engaging. On top of this, the additional time the animators had to work on the project and the fact that the manga is currently finished gives them much more flexibility to work around when it comes to the show. This allows Kubo's writing and character design to shine while also being boosted by the beautiful music from studio Mappa and gorgeous animation and fight choreography.

"I watched Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War without knowing anything about Bleach, aside from reading maybe the first 10 volumes of the manga about 10 years ago, and I gave it a 9 at first. The action, animation, and OST are all top-notch. It's easy to appreciate this anime without knowing what an Arrancar or a Bankai is, but then I went back and read all of bleach from the beginning, just to see what exactly it was that I just watched. Having understood the plot of bleach raised my already high appraisal of the series. This adaptation does everything a superb adaptation does. Aside from adding stunning visuals and music, the adaptation makes important details more obvious than the original material apparent. Both the Dub and the Sub are quite strong. I think the best way to enjoy Bleach would be to read the manga up until the Blood War arc, and then switch to the anime, as I think that the manga is superior until the 1000 year blood war. That's what made me give it a 10. It's a good thing they waited to adapt the final arc. No one would be talking about Bleach with as high esteem had this come out with the original anime adaptation's production value.

"Goated and absolutely deserves to be at the top of the list, only reason it's not at the top is because some salty prunes decided to review bomb this anime so it goes down the list cause nothing's allowed to top Fullmetal Alchemist apparently. Anyways, 10/10, Fullmetal Alchemist is good too, but y'all really need to touch grass. The music was great too with some of the classics being restrung into a more orchestral genre, and the animation is superb! Also the gore is fucking delicious! After years of being censored they go HAM with the deaths! And I'm talking Attack On Titan levels of gore! Heads being smashed like a pinata, torsos being sliced in half, and limbs being dissembled.",10,Recommended,"Apr 29, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_be7f7ec38f,9
"BLEACH IS BACK BABY!! As a Bleach fan I cannot express how happy I feel with Bleach being back with its full glory. fans have been waiting since the manga ended in 2016 for the TYBW to get animated and their waiting was not for nothing, as it is being animated by peirrot but this time with a good budget unlike the previous arc. Just hearing BANKAI again made me cry. The story follows where the anime ended in 2011 with quinces invading the Soul Society and Ichigo getting involved with this war like usual. I won’t spoil anything so I will keep it simple by not adding anything else. This final arc animation is like a love letter to the fans with it being compared to other big anime studios like Madhouse,Mappa,etc.The colors are vibrant, the lighting is amazing, and don’t get me started on the fights which are on another level compared to the old anime. Now lets talk about the voice actors. They are just amazing, you can feel that they are giving it their all working on this with their feelings for the series being transmitted through voicing these characters passionately. The music in Bleach is amazing as usual with Shiro Sagiso showing again how he is the god of anime music. I have nothing but praise for the production of this arc and can’t wait to see more of it. I hope this quality continues beyond the first season of this arc and goes beyond our expectations. Can’t wait to see more.

"In all honestly I think from what I saw so far, I think this first season alone is way better than the entirety of the original bleach. I love original bleach but the more I rewatch this season, the more I praise it. The overall quality when it comes to the characters, animation, soundtrack, and the artstyle is just too damn perfect. I was never around at the time the manga ended in 2016 but I remember people back then said that the anime wasn't coming back, bleach is dead, the final arc won't get animated. During winter of 2021 , we get our first new trailer for the new thousand year blood war anime and my gosh does it look so damn good. It was announced it that the new season was coming out in October 2022. I've heard that Tite Kubo is behind the production of the this new bleach anime. Now I'm reviewing this amazing season and boy was it tasty. I've been drinking the hell out of bleach for 2 years and to this day I'll never get tired of it. Art: It's such a huge understatement to say that the art was a massive improvement over the original 2004 anime. Not saying the original was bad by any means but the new art completely clears the original. It makes me appecirtate kubo's valiant efforts even more to give us bleach fans what we deserve. We've been thirsty for more bleach for years after all. Characters: We still have our same and good ol' karakura gang we've known for years fighting to protect each other for the sake of the human world. Our beloved substitute soul reaper Ichigo, our beautiful orange-haired orihime, chad, and uryu. The iconic gotei 13 also still remain what they were for 20 years and that's fight to protect the soul society. In this arc we get introduced to a new faction called the wandenreich army, who are next-level quincy's with new abilities we've never seen before that are infinitely stronger than uryu. Story: Our new antagoinst Yhwach and his quincy army known as the wandenreich quickly storms in the head captain's office sending a message that they were going to declare war on the soul society and to set a example, they killed the head captain yammamoto's lieutenant and killed numerous other shinigami. They even set an example by killing many hollows in Hueco Mundo. Basically the rivals of the shinigami and quincy never get along because of shinigami killing hollow so the souls can be sent to the soul society but the quincy decides to kill the hollows because it's kind of like a disease to them. The karakura gang except for Uryu, who is the fishy one of the show, travels across the garganta to hueco mundo to save the remaining surviving hollows. Yhwach takes advantage of that by sending his sternritter crew to invade the soul society but the gotei 13 are not down for the count yet. Ichigo eventually heads to the soul society to protect his comrades from the destruction of the Seritei. Animation: Not only is the animation an improvement over the original, but also it's very gory compared to the original. If I had one special early Christmas present, I would love for a remake of original bleach. Me speaking as a bleach fan, I do wish that the original was as gory as the new season. Even the manga is way gory than the original anime it's not even close. The color effects of both the quincy and the gotei 13 are so damn beautiful. There are still some stiff shots just like the original but the colors and special effect in general do make up for it. Conclusion: This is easily the best this show has ever looked. I really do love the war setting of this show. It's dark, gory, serious most of the time, and there's insane plot twists as the series goes on. Any die hard bleach fan that watches this will have an amazing time. I will say the pacing is sorta fast towards the beginning which people won't be a fan of, but kubo did state he was going to be cutting most of the comedic moments and others that he thinks, I thought the pacing was fine. He did say as well that he's adding new anime exclusives and extending plot points that wasn't explained enough in the manga which is a massive w. I have very high expectations that the thousand year blood war arc will do justice for the manga.",10,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0b962db04e,9

"first of all, I am a big fan of bleach and I finished the first part so if you are like me, of course, I would recommend you to watch it so, is it worth a watch? Well, the answer doesn’t matter at all there is no way you are not watching this if you have already watched the rest of it and you like the anime and hope to get a conclusion and if you are not I really don't know why are you watching it I guess to just spread hate again the fans got the rewards of their wait and patience because everything got way better in this arc on all levels: The art style, the music, the story, and the animation are fantastic, you can't ask for anything better than this. and from The first episode, the anime will surpass your expectations everything about the anime was amazing words can't fully express how amazing it was I easily can say Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen has been much better than any of us probably expected and that is reflected in its rank on MAL.which shows how much people are enjoying this season p.s this part has three of the best fight scenes I ever watched in bleach maybe after Ichigo vs Ulquiorra and anime overall summary We have reached the end of the first chapter out of the 4 parts of the Thousand Year War - Bleach, a war that brought together two poles, and between them, there is an ancient history written in blood! - The Quincy led by King Yhwach, who announced the beginning of the planned invasion since he suffered the greatest loss that almost ended the Quincy dynasty and dried it from existence on the Soul Society, which is under the protection of the Guti 13 led by the man who killed thousands of them 200 years ago, Yamamoto Genryusai - The movement of the Vandenreich forces sparked a declaration of war, in which the deputy commander of the 1st Division, Sasakibe, was the first chess piece to fall, followed by a series of massive losses incurred by the Gotei 13: Commander Kuchiki Byakuya, Deputy Commander Abarai Renji, robbed the Bankai of several commanders, which led to the curbing of the main force of the Shinigami and Deterring It Perhaps the greatest loss to the Soul Society since the inception of Gote 13 was the fall of Supreme Commander Yamamoto Genryusai - Quincy's forces did not suffer major losses, and compared to what was already achieved, the first battle in this war was a crushing victory for Vandenreich's forces, but! Winning the battle does not necessarily necessitate winning the war, and the time granted by the Quincy King by ordering his followers to temporarily withdraw after slaughtering the Guardian of Hell for Goethe 13 may pay his soul for it! - Instead of the complete annihilation of the enemies, especially with their morale and fighting spirit shattered, after the fall of the pillar on which their leader and the teacher had their backs to each other, Yhwach tended to withdraw for reasons that are currently still unknown to anime followers! - At this time, the Gotei had already begun to gather itself together, and after appointing Kyorak Shinsui as the successor to his mentor in command of the last 13 Gotei forces, he began to weave his strategy to turn the tables and restore dignity to the Shinigami community, and we will witness the effectiveness of this man's leadership in the upcoming second part. Bleach has never looked better. Thousand-Year Blood War presents an impressive transformation for the series that hopefully will continue throughout the run. Action scenes are crisp and inventive. Quincies are a terrifying villain group that is very effectively established with minimal screentime. The anime mostly elevates the source material, often improving upon the original work. Some comedic relief was lost in the adaptation process, but that’s a small price for a beautiful adaptation.",10,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_a3c48cbed7,10
"The first two episodes have been amazing AF - the animation has improved, the storyline is gripping, and the music has more depth.

"after seeing a lot of hate and many who didn't review it as it is. I only have a few words which maybe will clear things up. many love other animes and they hated bleach based on it having a higher rank I call it (attack on titan syndrome) or the old habit of big three fans hating each other in general, I know all about manga and I really came for the art, events, and fights and to see what we missed in the originals it's been years since I was excited and waiting for the next eps. I felt childish again and for a good reason. the music the art the voices the fights there are no fillers it's amazing how it is. I know the next three parts and the final one won't be as good but still am enjoying what I have so far. and one last thing having the anime rating changed from teen to Rating: R - 17+ (violence & profanity) is one of the things that we are blessed art 10\10 story 8\10 so far everything is building up well but I know what will happen so am reviewing this part music 10\10 bleach of the three big had and always have the best music I won't lie I sometimes go to youtube and listen to them characters 10\10 especially having a female character is not sexualized but rather made as a real fighter. so far the best female across all animes",10,Recommended,"Dec 15, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_eb79a5271f,10

They have filled up many questions by answering them with anime exclusive scenes which weren't there in the manga panels. Also, they switched certain plot points up to further improve the story telling. On top of that, they have also turned to a more darker version of bleach. War is not like any other shonen with the main character somehow getting more power with the power of friendship preventing casualties which always happen in a war. Bleach now gives a very dark vibe and the '' good '' side loses so much more than they ever did. It nearly begs the question; if good wins was it even worth it in the end? It seems there is alot of strategy involved in the war, which is a good thing. Alot of shonens give off the hack and slash vibe. Where as this arc shows how much strategy plays a part in either winning or losing a war. They have removed alot of humor panels in very serious situations which maintains the nailbiting experience. It truly feels that this enemy can put an end to everything and anyone can die. All-in-all; if you love bleach, this is the best and most accurate arc to date. This is how bleach always should have been. The animation is absolutely fantastic and they pay alot of tribute to original manga panels that had a big effect on the readers back when it released. Which is very nice. I went in hoping for Fullbringer arc animations atleast and hopefully better. They nailed it. I have to admit; Foreshadowing is there but to be fair, Kubo could have planted many more seeds to grow in the past. IF you watch it, you'll probably understand.

"Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War will be a great thing to watch for existing fans of Bleach, the potential opportunity to address the shortcomings of the manga is there, but, its faults lay precisely in the fact that is drawing material from a flawed work. That being said, quality of animation is stunning at times, and the pacing seemed fine for the most part with some caveats through the first 7 episodes. For those looking for a nostalgia trip, its certainly there, with a familiar cast of beloved characters thrown into the events of the Thousand Year Blood War. Would people without prior exposure to Bleach find the same sort of enjoyment and excitement as I've gained from watching these 8 episodes? I don't think so as this is the final arc of a story that spanned 15 years, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything there for new viewers. Kubo certainly has his flaws in his writing, character development is wanting at times, with many members of the supporting cast showing potential to be great characters, only to be canned into irrelevance. This flaw is probably tied with one of his greatest strengths and that is his ability to generate a myriad of characters with unique designs, especially when it comes to their actual skillset , weapons, and abilities. I suppose when you do have the ability to generate and manage a medley of characters through the story, although each introduction can serve to further the plot in particular direction, it could leave the development of your existing characters wanting, much in the same way as existing characters in games are power crept to irrelevance by a burgeoning cast of new characters. Although it appears that he was able to relay to the animation studios things he wanted to change and address, it remains to be seen how he will address the weaker point of the stories in the later arcs. When he was writing the manga, his publishers and editors were known to push deadlines and were disparaging of his work, which of course lead to his writing of the story in a way that he didn't like, leading to a hasty and doomed drive to wrap up the story as it were. There were a-lot of moments that were ""off-screened"" in the manga that resulted in less than satisfying experience for readers. With that being said, the show is greenlit for 4 seasons, it remains to be seen if Kubo was able to work on the story after its serialization had ended, and if the changes he made effectively improves the story or not. I wont get into the details of the female characters and their design as much as other comments, but I will say that he does like to draw a particular type of female character. Its a quite noticeable and might feel irksome to some, here is the umpteenth character with this particular design mold, but, I don't feel like it detracts from the merits of the overarching story. If you like Shounens, and something in the vein of Dragon Ball, this thing is for you, if you're looking for something more psychological, something that invokes a deeper sense of emotion, something more cerebral and of substance then this work will feel a bit more wanting.",9,Recommended,"Nov 29, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_6ed7e6cd31,10

"Bleach is one of the most awaited releases of 2022, and the hype surrounding it in the last two years was impressive. Having Pierrot and Tomohisa Taguchi (Akudama Drive) in charge of the production being two other major reasons for its pre-release long wait. Due to how there was a lot of hype before its release and the noise it is making, I decided to write a little about the best release of 2022. The story (yes, mr X who complained, here it is once more) revolves around the rise of Yhwach – or JuhaBach –, the Father of all Quincies and the biggest enemy of Yamamoto Genryuusai, the leader of the Soul Society. The first moment Ichigo and his friends become aware of it, is when a small-time Quincy called Ebern drops by the young Shingami’s bedroom window. Turns out that Ebern wanted to steal Ichigo’s bankai, which he couldn’t for reasons that are explained later. The battles in this last arc are the most intense and groundbreaking in the entire Bleach’s universe. Most of the shinigamis that didn’t have their bankais properly shown finally do it here and, above all, we learn more about Ichigo’s past. “Everything But The Rain” is the climax of his story, and is as surprising as it gets. In this saga, I started to view Isshin (Ichigo’s father) through different lens. His plot and encounter with Masaki makes him look way more mature than Kubo showed previously, to the point that Isshin turns into a different person if that makes sense. In TYBW, I noticed how they increased Uryu’s role a little more, and I hope they do it more, since he is a major part of this arc. Of course, not all characters can share a proper screentime, but at least do some justice for the main characters that were thrown to the side. TYBW is the second opportunity Kubo and Pierrot have to make it different, and this adaptation is impressing me episode by episode. The quality of this title is really a point worth mentioning. The idea behind the split of seasons was satisfying to me, since the cast in charge of production needs to rest, in order to make the content the best possible. With 4 seasons and 13 episodes each, I couldn’t ask for a more suitable and proper way to treat this series. The opening and ending, although not as memorable as the one in the 2004 series, still nails it and is worthy of being part of Bleach’s project. The animation quality is sometimes great sometimes “good”, but I won’t blame names here since we can’t expect always-high tier animation in any work, due to the amount of money needed. All in all, Pierrot is really redeeming themselves from the crime of using Amagai saga to interrupt Ichigo x Grimmjow xD Another point worth mentioning is the amount of anime-only/new content, which makes the whole story better paced (the opposite of the fast pacing in the manga). Considering the quantity of chapters adapted, and how much road is still ahead, I’m expecting a full season of new material. Or at least a better explained conclusion, picking Narita’s novels and bright and heavily rewritten ideas from Kubo’s mind. Even though most battles in this arc are originally just like Fake Karakura’s saga, in this second anime we have a deeper dive in the lore of Bleach; and a more suitable perspective of each of them involved. Zaraki vs Unohana’s fight is a proof of this care. In conclusion, Bleach Sennen Kessen-hen is my favourite release of 2022, and I highly recommend it if you watched and enjoyed the first series, or just read the manga. Thank you for reading.",8,Recommended,"Dec 25, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_2cd51230c9,10
"It's been a while since I reviewed anything, a while since I actually watched anything, years in fact. So why not continue with Bleach's new offering. The first reservation I had for me loving this was simply I was never the biggest fan of Bleach to begin with. However, I put this to one side and chose this to kick start my watching of anime once more and was actually pleasantly surprised at first. It throws you into the story straight away, no waiting, though you still must endure the token irritating, over scared character a lot of anime is cursed with. Thankfully, this irritation goes away and brings you back into the story quickly. It proceeds rather nicely into progressing what this season will detail and delivers great action sequences with some minor surprises in plot. The major bugbear I had with this is everything just seems rather unexplored. The desire to progress quickly with the plot comes at the expense of character building and I really felt this could have easily been a 25 ep season. Don't get me wrong, the 'moments' are really great. In-between these 'moments' however feels rushed and lacks the building of the dynamic we as anime fans come to expect from major anime titles such as Bleach. The animation has no flaws. It's no Demon Slayer, but what is really? It's does the job very nicely and though not groundbreaking, does everything it needs to do to be more than satisfactory. Music is awful. It's as simple as that. Moments of true emotion conveyed with essentially a b-movie version of Lethal Weapon soundtrack. Poorly thought through, lazy and very close to 'moment' killing. It's good, I can't say anymore, not brilliant, not amazing, but what I can say for sure, it's got me back into watching anime again and that most certainly is a good thing",7,Mixed Feelings,"May 1, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_b3ef266736,10
"First off, Congratulations to all Bleach Fans. I am happy for you guys, your beloved franchise celebrated a glorious 20th Anniversary with an absolute banger of an anime. Now for the Review TL;Dr 9/10 = If you are a Bleach fan, it's a love letter. If you aren't then you might want to read the next para and skip to the Conclusion at the bottom. Be warned that watching this arc's adaption blind (without context) is gonna leave you confused. Watching it blind is not the ideal experience. However, the fight scenes, the music, animation, narrative consistency and the Emotional Highs are done so well they can be Universal. So if you do decide to watch it blind, you will be in for a fun (albeit confusing) time Artistic and Fun: 2/2 The animation is top notch which makes fights incredibly fun to watch. The music is on point and hype. The narrative build up to the fights makes them impactful and their resolution truly something captivating. As far as fun goes, this is definitely fun. Huge credits to the studio for making it artistically sound with wide panning shots and dynamic camera work that makes for amazing visual story telling. Recommended: 1/2 While the anime is a work of art and highly enjoyable, I'm afraid it is unfairly saddled with the burden of needing 300 episodes worth of anime context. The amount of commitment to see through that I argue is better spent watching FMAB (64), AoT (25+12+22+28) and Steins;Gate (25 +24) which all neatly add up to 200 episodes. The pay off for each anime is immensely huge and I argue far greater than what this arc could give you. However, for Manga readers, people who have been following Bleach for a long time or dropped it couple of years back (meaning you have enough knowledge up to the Hueco Mundo Arc) they will definitely enjoy it. Those who haven't will struggle to understand and I don't blame them, plus the reveal at the end might ruin the 300 episodes preceding it as it is a Darth Vader level reveal. Narrative Consistency: 2/2 I used to hate on Bleach back in the day because for some reason it felt to me the franchise was all about making Ichigo relevant to everything in existence. Also the Ywach reveal felt wrong to me, rather that re contextualizing it felt like I was being told everything I saw was a lie. However, watching the anime and how they handled the same plot points but only gave them a good treatment presentation wise. I suddenly respect all the developments infinitely more. From Episode 1 - 12, you are never lost (assuming you have context of Bleach) regarding what is happening. The Plot, Complication, the Climax are always in play and result in a very satisfying Resolution upon completion. Even for someone who hasn't touched Bleach in a decade I was able to quickly grasp and understand the significance of a plot point, the vector of the complication (where and why it's headed) with the resulting Climaxes being truly amazing. This proper use of a narrative cycle keeps going and has layers, truly a well made anime. Emotional Highs: 2/2 Defined as moments that evoke strong emotion, be it Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Laughter or even Thought Provoking that can leave you speechless. United States of Smash, the unveiling of the master plan in FMAB and Okabe's Operation Arclight are good examples. Minimum 3 moments = 2 points Suffice to say, Bleach has a great many Emotional highs. From the fight scene of Old Man Yamamoto against Ywach, Kenpachi's awakening, Ichigo's awakening, the Origins of Ichigo, Ichigo vs Ywach and even Byakuya's fight are all packed to the brim with emotion that will leave you in tears or at the edge of your seat. So there is no shortage of moments that are totally worth the build up for. Bias: 2/2 (mentioned after the next 3 paras) Bleach has a very well made Power System regarding Bankais, Zampaktos, Hollows and Quincy's. Their limitations are also well explained and often what eventually lead to proper conflict resolution. This entire arc struggles the idea of what it means to be a Soul Reaper, what it means to be a Quincy and even the question that supersedes it all: ""Can Quincy's and Soul Reapers coexist?"" While it isn't handled in the complete depth as it should, I suspect it will be later, it is still deep enough to merit having my interest. Time is not spent on idly pondering upon them, most time is spent doing and acting on things with these ideas being the backdrop of the conflicts at hand. Bleach has good world building, with the idea of the Soul Society, Hueco Mundo and now the new enemy that shows up all being explained and belonging in the world rather than being parasitical extensions of it (Meaning we are not forced to assume too much) In fact the main complication stems from a long winded History the Soul Reapers have with the Quincy which in turn is thanks in part to how well the world is made. It isn't as great as Isekai's like Re zero and Mushoku Tensei, Cyberpunk settings like Edge Runners or even Fantasy like Overlord. However, it is significant enough to be merited with having a strong sense of History. My biases: Magic Systems, Idealogue and History Magic Systems: Any system with strict (Hard) or implied (Soft) restrictions of what it's capable of qualifies as a Magic System for the purposes of this Review. Be it FMAB's Law of Equivalent Exchange, Steins;Gate's World Lines or Dr Stone's Science History: Real world History or World Building and Lore based History. Re Zero and Overlord have vibrant Worlds with their own fleshed out History, Races, Relations, Politics and Factionalism. Bonus points for Natural Phenomenon Unique to their worlds. Whereas Youjo Senki / Saga of Tanya the Evil takes direct inspiration from WW1. Idealogue: Deep and Thought Provoking takes on contemporary or otherwise archaic matters. Be it Intangible stuff like Justice and Meaning of Life, or something achievable like being the Best at X and the ramifications of being so. My favorite is the Idea of being a King, and the concept of a King in general. Conclusion: 9/10 This anime is a love letter to Bleach fans, be it those who have been following it and sticking with it since the start or those who followed it somewhat. I have 0 complaints with everything done and would recommend it to every Bleach fan. However, as for casual observers, I cannot recommend this as they will likely be confused and the experience will be ruined for them as this is an adaption of the final arc. Neither would I recommend someone to start Bleach as a consequence of this anime, I believe your time is better spent watching FMAB, Steins;Gate and Attack on Titan S1-4. Their collective episodes are still 100 less than the Bleach anime, and the pay off is significantly better in the aforementioned compared to Bleach. Therefore, I'd say this anime is best intended for people who already know about Bleach and it is a top tier anime adaption at that.

"the adaptation of this arc is really amazing, probably the highest peak in animes for music and sounds wich left me speechless at every episode, the animations are top quality when it matters and ok when it dont, you get the usual bleach humor too wich is something fantastic, the story is building up and will grow in epicness at every season (we will see then how kubo will end it) sometimes the pace is a bit too fast, probably the story would have need one more season but hey, better fast than slow, and also better fast than nothing, wich is what we got the last 10 years",10,Recommended,"Dec 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f5ecfa0afa,10
"Most fans know that the manga storyline sucked. What's worse, they probably aren't planning to change the storyline in anime. HOWEVER, the production team did such an incredible job that you simply cannot give this anime a bad rating given this level of animation, graphics, atmosphere, temper, narration, and expression. Storyline aside, this is no doubt an 11/10 masterpiece. Not a single detail was imperfect. Even if the storyline is taken into account, the production team clearly expressed this story in the best way possible so that the story does not look as bad as it was in manga years ago.

"This particular rendition of Bleach should be seen as a master-class of what an S-tier anime looks like. But let me be clear, that fact has nothing to do with the source material or the story (i.e Bleach). Obviously the source material being GOOD makes it an enjoyable watch. But the implementation of its presentation, art-style choice, animation quality, and filmography techniques take it from A-tier to S-tier. I can count on 1 hand the number of anime I'd rate as ""S-tier"" and just take a look at my list - 400+ complete titles, starting from early the 2000's (which I consider ""the golden age""). First, the tributes to nostalgia of early-2000s style anime making it truly feel ""Bleach"" are greatly welcomed. A beautifully animated OP with banger song, the short-cut previews with the OP still playing in lower volume afterwards, the sharp-edge art-style reinvigorated in glorious HD, the beautiful balancing of juxtaposition between comedy and seriousness. It's such a throw-back and it made the immersion feel like I was watching the OG Bleach. This was just great creative choices from the director(s)/producer(s) for the source material. Second, the artistic filmography techniques are just so skillfully implemented. The camera management is fluid, robust, and epic. The quick-cut emotional sequences, the rotation/panning during action sequences, the intensity of the up-close shots for shock-factor. This is the best it gets in the industry. Period. No contest. Also the animation quality, you can easily tell the sweat put into this; clearly all hand-drawn with a high number of key frames. The action sequences are so fluid its easily to tell. Truly top-class. That's all I really wanted to say. I'm glad to see such a quality anime release again; it took YEARS for it to happen, but it did. I was beginning to lose faith that any quality anime would be produced post-2015. The industry's quality has dropped as a whole due to content saturation, time-crunch culture, over-use of 3D, and just a lack of creativity from all the mass-production & enterprise-ownership of the industry (coughsonycough).

"My review my change when the story reach the final act of the final arc, however, I think Bleach is doing a fantastic job as a Long-running shounen manga, although that's not the case anymore with this seasonal core system, but you know what I mean. This arc started out on a high note, and it kept its momentum so far (EP10) with great production, direction and adaptation. I love the fact that Kubo himself is involved heavily this time, and I still think (or at least hope) that he's gonna pull a Hideaki Anno move, by changing the ending since the majority of the fans didn't like how the manga ended. that aside. Bleach has been amazing so far, loving every single episode, you don't even have time to catch your breath, it'd be really interesting to see how it's gonna be played out by the end of the series.",10,Recommended,"Dec 14, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0b9eb1ce50,10
"As a fan of ""Bleach"", I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen"", and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations. The animation and sound design were simply breathtaking, bringing the world of Bleach to life like never before. The attention to detail and the use of vibrant colors and dynamic action sequences created a visual feast that left me in awe. For those of us who have been following the series for years, this latest installment was a long time coming and it did not disappoint. It's amazing how the creators managed to maintain the spirit of the original while still taking it to new heights. From the character designs to the fight scenes, everything was handled with care and precision, making for an unforgettable viewing experience. One aspect that stood out to me was the incredible fight scenes. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that some of the most intense battles in the series take place in this installment. The choreography and animation work together seamlessly, delivering edge-of-your-seat excitement and thrilling action. Additionally, I was thrilled to see some familiar faces making their return to the screen. The appearance of certain characters added even more depth and excitement to the story, and their inclusion was handled perfectly. In conclusion, ""Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen"" is a must-watch for fans of the series and newcomers alike. Its stunning animation, pulse-pounding action, and masterful storytelling make it one of the best anime releases of recent years.

"What happens when you take one of the most beloved shonens of its era and give it a glow up that looks hard even by today's standard? The answer is both something that makes it to the top 10 of MAL's rankings, and something that isn't as good as you would expect from my description. The original Bleach running ended on a pretty good change of pace. The last arc had a pretty fantastic build up for a disappointing climax, when Kubo is normally an expert at doing the opposite. This arc also starts pretty well. It's tense despite suffering from the we need more syndrome all shonen anime go through, the new bad guy of the season is as charismatic as the last one and it seems that Kubo has figured out how to write a nice story instead of sticking to his usual talents of drawing hot women (hot everyone) and intense fights, though we're not lacking in the latter (the women's new designs are pretty much all a downgrade aside from Orihime, but assuming you watched the first run of Bleach, it's nothing new here). So, yeah, despite that brand new coat of paint and a new and improved story, Bleach is still Bleach. The character interactions have come a long way since the Soul Society Arc (almost bearable now) and sometimes the comedy is almost funny. I'll be looking forward to the continuation of the Thousand Year Blood War (this name will never not be too edgy), since some of the coolest characters have and wil get some much needed development.",7,Recommended,"Nov 12, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_49d606c18a,10

"After all this time, still number one. Ten years after the original run of Bleach ended, Ichigo and company come roaring back, accompanied by savage new villains, and a stunning update in animation quality. For fans of the series, this is what we've waited for—the dazzling return of the Substitute Soul Reaper in all his action-packed glory. Any fears the reboot sequel wouldn't live up to the original have been thoroughly laid to rest. Story: New fans of the series should watch the original run first, because there is no tiresome exposition or recap. The story picks up where the original run left off, and everyone’s back for this next fight. The conflict between the Soul Society and Quincies erupts into war, leaving the Soul Reapers fighting for survival against their strongest foe yet. Along the way, major events from the past are re-contextualized and the very nature of Ichigo's abilities questioned. Characters: Plenty of fan-favorite characters get time in the spotlight. Several characters’ backgrounds are explored and long-standing mysteries are explained. The gang of antagonists, the Wandenreich, is chilling in their strength and ruthlessness. Yhwach, the leader of this fearsome army, makes for a menacing new enemy. Animation: The animation is a major highlight. Every scene is rendered in gorgeous style. From the black, white, and pink stylization of the opening theme and flashbacks to the awe-inspiring action scenes leaving one on the edge of their seat. The artistry of the series goes beyond anything before and evokes excitement and emotion in every frame. Music: Captures the iconic soundtrack of the original run with welcome additions and remixes, aiding in the action's suspense. Japanese Voice Cast: Voice work of the highest caliber, the cast reprise their roles as if no time has passed and delivers a worthy performance. Overall Enjoyment: This continuation will overjoy any long-time fan of the series. As the world waits for more, this writer shall prepare for the battle to begin once more.

"In my heart this is a ten, babes, just know that. Well, it seems like everyone in the anime community was waiting for this revival, and I have to say: the resurgence of Bleach did not disappoint me. To start off with why I ended up scoring this a 9, it's basically down to the fact that not much can happen in 13 episodes with the type of story Bleach is (which is a Shounen that isn't afraid to take its time to tell a story properly, which I can't say for a lot of modern Shounen). The start of this season, while a whole nostalgia bomb for me, was slow, and the same can be said for the end of the season. Bleach manages to maintain interest throughout, though, regardless of what's going on, because... well, that's the byproduct when everything from the world to the characters to the conflict is electric. Some big things did happen this season that I'm glad the series was able to get to in this first leg of the Thousand Year Blood-War Arc adaptation, although I do wish this season could have been longer because, as it stands, it does seem a bit short-changed. Everything else surrounding the start of this arc, however, was incredible. The scoring for Bleach has always been good, but with ten years between anime adaptations, the improvements in art and animation blew me away nearly every episode. It really felt like nothing was spared; from the battles to the physical comedy to the characters' expressions, I was constantly impressed with this season and happy to see Bleach get such good treatment. I'm not sure what I can say about the rest of the season without spoiling anything, but I'll say that, although it does seem like it would have been a more well-rounded season had it been longer and included a bit more content from the manga. it still managed to end effectively and had very good pacing throughout. Of course, not only is the story told well, but the story itself is incredible in its own right (though I'm sure most who are reading this review and watching this season have read the manga, as well). Overall, I was very pleased with this return to Bleach, and I'm probably the most excited I've ever been about the continuation of an anime. I look forward to seeing all the amazing things this team has in store for us in future seasons.",9,Recommended,"Dec 31, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_02ab97e5f2,11
"If you're not familiar with Bleach and you're wondering if this show is actually good: it's not. ""Why is it ranked so high then?"" I hear you ask, quite simply because the Bleach fandom is hyped that the show is back and are massively hypevoting it. Both seasons of this new Bleach have great animation, and that's about it. If you're familiar with Bleach you might get some enjoyment from seeing all your favourite characters again. However in terms of story or dialogue this show is atrocious. In truth this show is really just an excuse to animate some cool fight scenes. Sadly almost all fights in this show follow the exact same pattern: a good guy uses a power, the opponent goes ""nani?!"", the good guy then explains the entire extend of their power (which is incredibly dumb), which the opponents then completely counters with their own power after understanding the ability. The opponent powers up and uses a new ability, the good guy goes ""nani?!"" and then the opponent explains their power, which the good guy then counters with their new power (or they get help from a friend). That's basically every fight in this show. It's laughably terrible how after literally every attack a character is compelled to explain what they just did. if you're not a Bleach fan, and you actually care about story this show is a hard skip. If you either like Bleach or cool action scenes give it a try I suppose.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 11, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_126d492e9c,11

"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen is one of the most well-directed anime one could find. While I have not watched all of Bleach, I feel this arc has done a great job handling the sheer amount of content they had to work with as well as the time gap between the original anime run and this season's arc. With an enormous cast, it could be difficult to keep track of all the characters running about, but I think I was able to get the main gist of each character from character design and brief introductions. For example, the captains of Soul Society are all unique enough for me to remember who they are even though I would not be able to recite more than two of their names. This could be a flaw, but the director's choice to remove exposition in favor of moving the story along is a welcomed one for me. I would not, after all, want to spend an episode on a minor character unless it contributes to the story meaningfully. While the second half of this season has a lot less action compared to the first half, there are still the same highs in meaningful emotional moments for Ichigo which aid in valuable character development. The direction has a plethora of interesting choices like background color design and a show-no-tell style to the head captain's history. Much more importantly, to the general anime fan, is that animation has reached a new high. With intricate shading and refined movement, the animation gives life to an action-packed ""war"" that cannot be understated. The flames emitting from the blade, the holy light of the quincies, these are just some of the effects brought about with flying colors. There are a lot of great anime this season and, while the content for Bleach is the most daunting, it is the most worthwhile.",10,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_52bd7b5164,11
"Return of the King. Holy crap does it feel amazing to be a Bleach fan in 2022(3). After all of the slander and character assassinate made over the years by Youtubers who don’t understand the difference between a passive and active protagonist, and an anime community more than willing to swallow and parrot the lies and rhetoric against the series like a Tori politician, not only has Bleach made the greatest anime comeback probably in the history of anime, but it is literally (as of the time of writing) ranked number 1 on MAL. Watching the amount of copium huffed by Bleach deniers to deal with how wrong all their bad takes have been over the years has been -for me- exquisite. As soon as the new remix of number 1 started popping off in the first episode and we were reintroduced to Ichigo, Chad, Orihime and Uryuu fighting hollows in a gloriously new, movie-quality animation style, I genuinely became emotional. Like old friends you haven’t seen in 10 years returning home for the first time (except they’re not real and I watch anime because I don’t have any real friends so I’m guessing that’s what it feels like). The Thousand Year Blood War is the final arc of the series (until Kubo starts working on that Hell arc) where all of the insanely well-thought-out foreshadowing starts to come together and questions about Ichigo’s power, his family and everything Rain included finally start being answered. Not only that, but Kubo -who worked on the anime with the team at Pierrot directly- not only had the final say on everything that was cut and changed but add additional story scenes where he couldn’t in the manga (because he ran out of time), meaning there’s no filler and everything that happens in TYBW anime is cannon. Also, I have to hand it to studio Pierrot. They do get shat on a lot for some of the anime they put out and for good reason (I like Black Clover, but god does the anime look like shit.), but in the hands of Taguchi, director of Akudama Drive, they can make anime gold when they want too. The tone depicted through colour, the lighting, and the animation coupled with Bleach composer Sagisu's new remixed OST that lead to some of the most amazing fights and scenes in the entire series, it’s just perfect! It was amazing to see everyone who watched TYBW weekly going through the same “holy fucking shit” moment online when they’d just finished an episode. This is what 10 years of preplanning looks like. Now, as much as I want to be a Bleach fanboy, whack on a 10/10 and call it a day, I can’t because I do have some criticism for the first Coeur, especially as someone who has read the manga hundreds of times. It’s great that Kubo permitted Taguchi to “aggressively cut” many of the jokes and lines/scenes that he deemed were irrelevant or repeated to not ruin the pacing. I was also one of those fans who was upset to see some of the humour cut, but around episode 8 I realised that to keep with the tone and the pacing it was the right call because it would’ve felt really weird for the characters to go back to being goofy-fun-times after what was essentially a massacre. However, I do think Taguchi took the cutting a bit far to the point where some really important lines and context which are relevant to the story, and explaining certain events were cut. Some of these cuts were instead written in mid-episode cards to explain things like world-building and character abilities. However, I can’t read Japanese, nor were they translated on Hulu (for me at least) and I haven’t watched the dub so I don’t know if they’re translated for that version which means that anime-only viewers and those who can’t read Japanese are excluded. It also just feels really weird not to have certain characters explain certain things like the rules of broken Bankai to someone like Ichigo because it assumes he knows that bit of important detail when he doesn’t. Also, episode 10 is structured and edited strangely and it’s the only episode I thought was off despite its content. Bleach never died, but boy is it back. I’m so happy with TYBW that I genuinely want the whole of the Bleach anime remade with Taguchi at the helm. No Filler, all bread-girl. I know that is incredibly greedy and entitled for me to want, but Bleach was my gateway into anime. It was the first (proper) anime I’d ever watched as a teen and it completely changed my view of what cartoons could be at the time. “What the fuck is an Ichigo?” I asked myself at 14. What the fuck indeed. And now here we are, 2022(3). The Bleach fans won in the end. We got what we deserved. A fucking incredible anime adaptation. I’m so happy about its success and I can’t wait for Coeur 2 in July.

"Bleach is back! More than a decade after the well-liked long-running series ended without the final arc from the source material, Bleach has come back with the final arc from the manga: The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc. I'll assume you've seen the original for the purposes of this review - though notably, knowledge of the filler arcs are not necessary. Story: Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War takes place right after the events where we left off in, from the original anime. We are very quickly tossed into the main story line - where we see the Quincys, long to be thought of as mostly gone, make a return to the Soul Society where they declare war. So why? We've had minor story snippets in the past, mostly through Uryuu, about why the Soul Reapers and Quincys were at odds, but nothing ever that made us think the very final arc would bring about this kind of chaos. But now the Quincys are back, and have brought nothing short of an army that seeks to kill every single Soul Reaper in the Soul Society - and in existance. The story in itself isn't anything we haven't seen before, but Bleach manages to show what happens when an entire line of beings - ie: Soul Reapers - start to get desperate. The troops that the Quincy army bring to the field, known as the Sternritter, are no pushovers either. We see many of them go toe-to-toe with some of the best within the Soul Society. We even see snippets of power from their leader, Yhwach (curiously pronounced as ""Yu-Ha-Bach""). This is no small war, and Bleach seeks to show us every little bit of it, including losses that are only starting. There are some episodes that give us small breaks from the grand war scene, and while they don't feature big fights, they do, however, show us important plot points that have resulted from the chaos that we already saw. What goes on with Ichigo, are parts of his background linked back to this war, how does Uryuu react to this war that's going on? These are all questions that are touched on - and don't forget, this is only part one out of part (at least rumoured) four. We're only getting started. (10/10) Characters: New characters to our story obviously put the spotlight on the Quincy leader, Yhwach. He is absolutely ruthless and shows no mercy in seeking his goal out - be it against his foes, or his own army. We also get to see small parts of his past, specifically with how it pertains to the Soul Reapers too, so this isn't just some random being that came into power either. He is to be feared and is the endgame. Most of his Sternritter with special letters assigned to them associate to a power they have (Ex: Bazz-B is allocated B, for Bang, because he can shoot gigantic fire bullets). Disney+, disappointingly, didn't subtitle any of these, and that's a layer I wish we were shown on screen by them. This obviously means they're stronger than your garden variety soldier. We get a chance to see the personalities on some of them, which was neat, though I expect we'll see more as the series carries on. Ichigo and company are all back and have basically not changed from where we left them. Orihime, Chad and Rukia don't have a ton of screen time, though I expect that to change in future parts. I'm happy to see that the captains get their shine here, as many are tasked with fighting an important member of the Sternritter, or going through some other massive change. This is the most they've been involved in quite some time. The other new characters worth mentioning are the Soul Society's Team 0, which are get involved in the back half of the series. They're a fun, fun group and are definitely more than they appear. Again, I hope they get more involved in the story as this carries on, but I like what I see so far. (9/10) Art: I was very worried when Pierrot was announced as the returning studio handling this series, because of their track record with Naruto - in making fights needlessly long and poorly animation. No such problems here. This was very well animation which maintained consistent throughout the entirety of the season. (10/10) Sound: Bleach returns with most of the OST, or some form of it, from the previous incarnation, which remains strong. I wasn't necessarily attached to either the OP or ED, but they were solid. Most of the VOs return, surprisingly, with only sixteen Bleach characters having their voices changed. Most of them are for fairly minor roles with notable ones being Chad (now Alain Mesa, replacing Jamieson Price because he no longer voices characters of colour) and anyone voiced by the Critical Role crew. The ones replacing them, however, are no slouches, as they're basically as good as the VOs that came before them. Notable additions to this season's cast, most of which voice multiple characters, include Robbie Daymond, Xander Mobus, Todd Haberkorn, Cherami Leigh, Jeannie Tirado and Aleks Le. This is a talented cast and I'm happy to see that a lot of the VOs who basically don't do a ton of VO work anymore, returned. (10/10) Overall: Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is amazing and should be on everyone's radar who were even small fans of Bleach, back when it originally aired. Disney+ did a huge disservice to the fans by not posting their English dub episodes in line with Hulu's. I'm not terribly surprised considering what they did with Summertime Rendering, but I can only hope they shape it up for when the next season rolls around. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is brutal and amazing, both at the same time, very worthy of the 10/10 that I'm so hesitant to give anime these days.

A few scenes cut to fit the darker tone of this arc which is fitting. Perfect set up for the rest of the story. The first episode is more of a showcase for fans of the OG series to appreciate the characters and their strength, which was very welcome after such a long time out of the spotlight. Shiro Sagisu has once again composed a flawless soundtrack including reworks of classics from the original series. Fans of other shounen will almost definitely appreciate and enjoy the new season due to it's fantastic visual style, the Quincies feel like threatening villains and the tease of Aizen's return will keep viewers hooked. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Dec 20, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_381018d200,11
"I cannot believe after all these years Bleach returned! They say when an anime is mostly carried by the visuals, that is a bad thing. Not so here say I, not a naysayer but a humble watcher of this masterpiece. They've has done it again, and has presented us with something beautiful. I thought the other seasons were good, but compared to this, well... Let's just say this make the Soul Vampires look like kids stuff. The story is basic but a gcongreattinuation, and is mostly irrelevant to the legendary fights being performed. The characters are amazing as always. The new Villian is amazing and maybe close to Aizen. A wonder to behold, this enrapturement, is a cacophony of color and sound. This deserves all the praises it gets plus more. I recommend watching it with friends and family because it only heightens the experience.

This show is so overrated. Watched it and it was ok but like the reviews here are all like 10/10? Feels like just the same formula of any shounen with a new big baddy thats stronger than all the old big baddies and then ass pull powerup for the MC. There isn't even a conclusion yet and this whole series revolved around rewriting over old backstory in the most uninspired way possible to give more chosen one vibe to the MC. Even 13 episodes felt like a lot since you can guess what was going to happen half way through and the second half was slow AF exposition broken up by shitty comedy elements that don't mix at all with the serious nature of what was at stake. Overall enjoyment is quite low for this. It was OK. 6/10,6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 16, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_1f3db74a17,11
"No matter how you slice it, bleach sennen kessen-hen is top class and there is no, i said NO argument against it. What are the weaknesses and downsides you may ask? well you need to know bleach to get it's full effect. That can come in any form, whether you have watched all 300+ episodes of the anime or read the manga. Obviously watching TYBW without knowing the full story prior, (aizen+fullbringer arc) then you won't get it's full effect. It's been a while since I read the manga but if you want to get caught up on it prior to TYBW, the final arc, before you watch the anime, then I would 100% recommend reading it to give yourself a chance to experience the anime. It is understandable if someone does not want to read all 74 volumes or watch 300+ episodes to get caught up for a 13 season show. The rating of the show should not suffer because of that though. Bleach is returning over a decade later, and only a select number of people who have consumed bleach are likely the only ones watching TYBW. After all, it wouldn't make any sense to watch something you have no idea about and rate it 1/10 right guys (wink wink)? If you know bleach, then there is absolutely zero excuse not to watch. The number one crtique among those who know bleach is pacing, and I somewhat agree. I think that certain plot points are rushed but instead of getting into the minute details, I applaud it's fast pacing. It makes the season action-packed and extremely entertaining with no boring filler or flashbacks (the important flashbacks were there obviously). Everything is done amazingly including animation which pierrot outdone themselves after the travesty of naruto shippuden and boruto. The final critique is soundtrack and I agree. The music isn't great and neither is the timing, but it wasn't AWFUL. It's average at best, probably below-average but does not takeaway from the brilliance of Bleach Thousand Year Blood-War Arc. If you know Bleach, you need to watch. Whether you want to do the work of getting caught up through the manga or anime if you haven't already is up to you. 9/10",9,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 9, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_03a94c7f16,11
"Rushed and Underwhelming: A Tale of Missed Marks and Lost Essence Oh boy, where do I even begin with Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War? As a long-time fan of the franchise, I had high hopes for this final arc adaptation. But sadly, it fell far short of my expectations and left me feeling disappointed. I'm here to share my honest thoughts on this particular installment of the series, and why it failed to live up to its potential. First and foremost, the animation quality in Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War was a major letdown. The art seemed rushed and lacked the attention to detail that fans have come to expect from the beloved Bleach universe. The character designs felt flat and lacked the depth they once had. The fight scenes, which were supposed to be the highlight of this arc, were lackluster and lacked the intensity and fluidity that made the earlier seasons so captivating. It's such a shame because the source material deserved better treatment. Another major issue is pacing. The story was crammed into just a handful of episodes, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. In the source material, the Thousand-Year Blood War arc spanned several volumes and was packed with intricate plot twists, character development, and epic battles. However, this adaptation failed to capture the essence of the original material, opting for a condensed version that robbed the story of its depth and complexity. Important character moments were overlooked, leaving viewers disconnected from the emotional impact that was supposed to be felt. Moreover, the lack of character development was a huge letdown. In previous seasons, Bleach excelled at creating compelling and multifaceted characters. However, in the Thousand-Year Blood War adaptation, characters were merely reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, devoid of the growth and depth that they had previously exhibited. This lack of investment in character development made it difficult to connect with the cast on an emotional level, ultimately leaving the audience unfulfilled. The OST (original soundtrack) is another aspect that deserves criticism. The music, which was once a staple of the series and contributed significantly to the atmosphere, felt uninspired and repetitive. The absence of impactful and memorable tracks only added to the lackluster experience of watching this adaptation. Lastly, the ending of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War fell flat. Without giving away any spoilers, it concluded in a rushed and unsatisfactory manner, leaving many loose ends and unanswered questions. It felt as if the creators were merely trying to tie up loose ends as quickly as possible, without giving proper closure to the storylines and character arcs that fans had invested in over the years. To sum it up, Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War fell short in multiple areas. With subpar animation, rushed pacing, lack of character development, uninspiring music, and a dissatisfying conclusion, it's clear that this adaptation did not do justice to the source material. As a long-time fan, it pains me to give this series a 3/10 rating. However, it's important to critically assess even the things we love and acknowledge their flaws. Hopefully, in the future, Bleach will receive the adaptation it truly deserves, one that faithfully captures the essence of the amazing world created by Tite Kubo.",3,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_d50847ced6,11
"Hiya! My name is Anime Logician, and I'm an Anime YouTuber. I've watched anime since I was at the age of eight, and I'm still managing to this day! With over 400+ anime titles viewed, I decided to share my knowledge and wisdom with the anime community. With my experience with anime, I am reviewing anime for the community and my enjoyment. Now then, let's get started with the review. PLOT: Bleach, The Thousand Year Blood War is an arc full of surprises and great points within the story. A thousand years have passed since the war between the original 13 captains and the quincies. It seems Ichigo Kurosaki isn't entirely done with his soul reaper duties, and so begins a new showdown as Ywacch and his new and improved quincy army are back for revenge and are wanting to demolish the Soul society and bring an end to the thirteen court guard squads, but just how will this end exactly? I'm eleven episodes into the anime, and already my expectations have been met. Back when Bleach ended on that sorry excuse of an arc, I had been wondering will Bleach ever return to its glory days or will it forever be overshadowed by its terrible filler arcs and lack of character development. Still, as I said before, my expectations were met, and am glad Bleach is back and this time even better than before! PLOT RATING: 10/10 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Character development is another redeemable quality to this anime, as we are finally getting to some of the more unknown parts of the characters! Rukia, Ichigo, Renji, and much much more!! More bankais are awakened, New captains are chosen, and Lots of character development is taken place within each episode. I am excited about the new episodes and look forward to completing my Bleach DVD collection soon!! CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT RATING: 10/10 ANIMATION: What can I say about the animation? Well, it's new and improved; it seems to be more crystal clear and more persistent, like watching an episode of Demonslayer or Jujutsu Kaisen, it wasn't the same Bleach I had watched 10 years ago, but it was a new and improved anime, which is why the animation is perfect to me. ANIMATION RATING: 10/10 INTRO/OUTRO: The intro and outro are great compared to the past intros/outros, and when it comes to the intros and outros I've never once waivered when it came down to loving them. ""SCAR"" by Tatsuya Kitani is what I would call a great Intro, my only complaint is that the track itself could have been a bit more electrifying and hyped. Regardless it is what it is, and I'm in agreement that the track does the anime justice. ""Saihate"" by SennaRin is perfect and in my opinion the better of the two tracks! How can I describe this track? Electronic pop music followed by beautiful and melodic vocals. The track itself is perfect and unforgettable. INTRO: 4/5 OUTRO: 5/5 INTRO/OUTRO: 9/10 PERSONAL OPINION: It's been over 10 years basically past a decade and it's finally here, the new Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War Arc and I'm here for it! Being the OG fan that I am I decided to add this anime to my collection and this anime will be complete once I am done with my anime collection. Honestly I disliked how Bleach had ended years ago and ending on a bad note should never be something an anime does, but with the TYBW arc being animated I now have faith that Bleach will be considered one of the best anime to ever exist and it'll be up there with FMAB and One Piece. I've been wanting to say this for years and now I can..... I AM GLAD TO BE A BLEACH FAN!!!!! FINAL VERDICT: 9/10 - AMAZING Bleach is an anime which has had it's Ups and Downs, but unlike some anime, Bleach has made a remarkable comeback and the community is hyped for this anime to be back. Let's hope it stays that way.

"I am so very happy with this Anime i could grin from ear to ear. The original Bleach whilst not terrible was far to slow. The fights took a decade to complete and they didn't feel satisfying as they didn't feel like they had any consequences. I feel this made the original quite the slog to get through. Especially someone who watched bleach for the first time only a few years ago. Maybe it's simply due to it aging poorly however this improved upon the original in every way imaginable. The fights in this Anime look great in terms of animation quality and i also believe they're far more interesting as a result of a faster pace. This Season perfectly shows how you can tell a big story in a faster pace as the original. The original (if it told the same story) would have dragged and probably made these thirteen episodes last fifty or possibly sixty episodes. I'm so happy with this more modern approach to the Anime. I have also failed to yet mention how there are real consequences felt within this season. Now i will not spoilt anything, but if you have seen the original i believe this will make you so happy. The only part that the original does almost as well i believe is the story. However this season handles it better with a quicker pace. The issue in the original was it was far too dragged out. I must also mention how the villains feel great and their threat feels real. I am also shocked at how graphic it can be. Now it isn't anything i would consider truly Gorey. That being said it doesn't need to be. This season perfectly shows the brutal nature of attacks with a fair amount of blood and body parts being dismembered. If you are reading this and haven't seen the Anime please do not watch this if my words have made you believe it is extremely gory as it is not. But compared to the original i have far more interest in the effects of attacks and the consequences of their outcomes. The gore i also believe is perfect how it is this season. There is no need for it to get more adult at all. I'm very impressed with the team behind this revival of Bleach. Overall i think this is definitely a recommendation from me. That being said you of course should know the story of the original before coming to this which is a sad requirement to truly get the most out of this Anime i believe. 8/10 - HotHamlet",8,Recommended,"May 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_67681318a3,11
"It's good to see that this series can still give me hope after such a lackluster finish to the manga. Needless to say, this cour looked exceptionally good, all things considered. If we're talking about individual episodes, it could even stand up among the best of the season and even the whole year. However, we're talking about the whole product, and I'm already seeing some of the cracks in the narrative. The gorgeous animation makes them harder to see in some ways, and I suspect that this series will live or die based on how it executes the big fights that are coming down the pike (I think it got rather messy during those), but I can't set those aside, particularly the retcons that are meant to cover for plot holes in the original run. I don't want to be too harsh on a cour that I still think stands among the better runs of anime this year, even if the pacing feels a bit rushed in places and a bit too slow in others.",8,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_6bdc4c530f,11
"In the last few years, I have transitioned from being an avid anime watcher to a manga enthusiast. So I have not watched any anime for like a good 3-4 years. But decided to watch bleach purely off the hype this new arc was getting last year(I read the manga so I understand why). This brought back a lot of nostalgic feelings that have dwell very deep from me, BLEACH IS BACK BABY!!!!! The show is beautiful to watch, the fights are intense and most of all your favorite cast is back. To me this season shows all the best points about bleach.

"From the very first seconds of the premiere episode, this show immediately sets a film-like, cinematic tone that grabs your attention. The reintroduction of the original cast is sure to bring back waves of nostalgia, making viewers feel like kids again, just like when they watched the original series for the first time. The production quality of the first episode is so high that it feels more like a feature film than a typical TV show. Once it's over, you'll find yourself eagerly craving more. The first episode final montage is a masterclass in evoking nostalgia, leaving you awash in memories and loving every moment. This series is a treat for 90s kids, delivering the non-stop action we grew up with, combined with animation that's more impressive than anything we've seen before. The soundtrack, too, is perfectly crafted to amp up the excitement in every scene. As the new season progresses, it dives deeper into Bleach’s complex and rich lore, particularly towards the end, offering longtime fans plenty to appreciate. It's worth noting that the show includes after-credit scenes that contain crucial details, so be sure to stick around and not miss out on these important moments. Overall, this season is a nostalgic thrill ride that’s hard to resist.",10,Recommended,"Sep 1, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_14de0f4530,11
"Bleach Thousand Year Blood War is better than the original Bleach, so far. Watching it as a stand-alone project, without knowledge from the first series would probably ruin the experience. On the bright side, there is no filler episodes, there is no beating around the bush, it's 13 episodes of fun, and i looked forward to it every week. Easily a top 10 anime of the year, with one of the best episodes in animation history. Animation 10/10 - There is stunning art at times, especially during episode 6 and 7. Sound 10/10 - Same great OST with some flare added to them, plus great effects and VA. Story 6/10 - By itself, the story would confuse watchers, but most watchers know what the original plot is. Characters 8/10 - Great characters, but with only 13 episodes, the spotlight can only shine on a few, for now. Enjoyment 9/10 - Enjoyed it start to finish. Studio Pierrot had a great fluidity from episode 1-13. Overall, i was surprised by Bleach TYBW. My brother even flipped from ""Not watching it"" to ""When's Bleach out?"".

"Brief overview: MUST-WATCH, Bleach last Arc that is a war set between the Soul reaper and a mysterious unknown enemy This review will be based on part 1 and 2 of TYBW. To prevent spoilers most content will be shortened Story 9/10 I know it's a crime to not give this a 10/10, but hear me out. The story sets straight after the fullbringer arc where Ichigo and others have their power back. However, the soul reapers were only expecting peace and dealing with the everyday hollows until one day they met a mysterious enemy that had taken advantage of them and killed many of its comrades. Therefore, the soul reaper was severely unstrengthened and unprepared for the upcoming war. This left the soul society at risk of being overthrown and taken by that mysterious enemy. The story is great, it shows the seriousness of the situation and the current issue with the soul reapers who haven't fully mastered their powers and were rushed to train and gain those powers within a short time. However, this is the biggest problem with the story is the pacing. The pacing of the story is so fast towards the point that it needs to be watched at least two times to not miss out on all the content as it can easily be left out if you do not pay enough attention, but it does show all the major part well enough. Characters 8/10 (Minor spoilers) Bleach has this strange way of handling their characters where they are shown in a few episodes and throughout the rest of the series are basically never shown again. As of now is still too early to judge, but the characters are great. It shows every character's major powers and abilities throughout the Arc, but here's the problem that has occurred in the old Bleach and probably now as well. This is where the quantity amount of scenes/episodes of the characters showing their abilities are shown in a very small amount of scenes and throughout the rest of the series, and it is never shown again. I give you an example of One piece Marine ford arc. When we first witness Akainu's power it is not only shown in just one episode, but throughout many episodes and fights with different characters during the Marine ford arc by prolonging it. However, Bleach only showed its character's power in only a few episodes/scenes and it didn't give a satisfactory amount of content from those characters as the content shown is so short and some didn't describe what their ability or figure out what their ability are. (SPOILER) There is also some missed opportunities for the characters that should've included a backstory which is the bambies. The bambies are one of the most noticeable groups throughout the Quincies and are barely shown any backstory or abilities during their fight with Ichigo which is quite a letdown. Animation 10/10 The animation is the greatest animation that Bleach has to offer. Out of the big three Bleach has the most quantity of quality animation and after the long hiatus of Bleach it does show that the animators put a lot of love and efforts into the animation. They are probably fans of the series like us. TLDR This is a massive step for Bleach. The story included a lot of seriousness and struggle to fight the new unknown enemy. The characters are great, but some of the most noticeable didn't have enough screen time which is let down and the animation is movie quality level which is great.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f9f74da7ce,11
"It's good to see that the Bleach anime is back to adapt the Thousand Year Blood War arc. After I finish every episode, I re-read the manga to know which chapters it adapted, to find out what details from the manga got omitted in the anime, and to see what new scenes the anime adaptation got over the manga. Manga content that weren't adapted into the anime were either brief dialogue, some comedy scenes, and some tidbits of info that could have supplemented a fact or explanation. Speaking of the new scenes in the anime adaptation, remember Ichigo using Bankai to dispatch some normal Hollows in the first episode? Yes, it's one of those new scenes and a good example of a fanservice that I think were primarily meant for long time fans who finally get to watch a brand new episode of Bleach after the more or less 10 year long wait. The fanservice that really stayed on me was the usage of Rapport by Kitani Tatsuya which was featured in Bleach EX last year in the first episode's ED with the visuals showing important scenes from the previous Bleach anime, mosty Ichigo's journey from meeting Rukia up to the Fullbring arc, basically a recap of the 366 episodes of Bleach minus the fillers. Another fanservice that took me by surprise was the showcasing of the original Gotei 13 captains. In the manga we only got silhouettes, with Yamamoto and Unohana the obvious ones but in the anime adaptation we finally get to see what they all look like. On the music/sound side, there were some new OSTs but majority of them were remixes of OSTs from the previous Bleach anime, and I expect it to be the case for the other soundtracks that we will hear from the future episodes yet to come. The OP and ED were good, most notably the ED (because of Hiroyuki Sawano). Looking forward for the next batch of OPs and EDs. On the art and animation side most were done well, especially during the big fights, most notably Ichigo vs the main villain. It was nice to see that the anime prolonged the fight between Ichigo and the antagonist and had a good amount of sakuga. The 3d animation on the Hollows in the first episode looked ok, in contrast to the 3d animation applied on one part of Yamamoto's Bankai which looked weird. There was also that pink aesthetic in the OP and flashback scenes from the previous Bleach anime on every episode which I think was unnecessary but I guess it's still ok. All in all, it was a nostalgia trip and a momentous occasion to finally watch the TYBW arc, albeit the first part for now, in anime format. If you watched the previous Bleach tv series, read the manga, and/or still care for Bleach's narrative, you may give this anime adaptation a try.",9,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_48fedb9480,11

I like how the studio did things like show the volume and weight of hair and clothing. Something that I don't think was highlighted much when the series last aired. Sometimes the story jumps a little too far ahead and then I get lost, but otherwise it's fun to watch.

"As someone whos been a huge Bleach fan since the Arcancars, the newest series is both amazing to behold continue and yet, sad to see Bleach at only a fraction of what it once was. If you watch this, never seeing Bleach series, then you're obviously not going to keep up with this new arc. I seriously don't know why Bleach doesn't get enough love, but its an amazing series with some of the best fight animations ever. That's most in part to the insane creator and his team of launching crazy characters, abilities, and a surreal lore of supernatural magic. This latest series, although looking more cinematic, suffers from not delivering an expected intro banger, ESPECIALLY FOR BEING A MAIN STORY. Like the intro is something better fit for something in a filler. But anyways. The 1000 year blood arc is seriously an insane story if you've already read the Manga. Sadly, the animation REALLY missed out on their own gold mine. 1000 year blood arc is a story as good as the original Hollow arc, and yet, the show itself just feels like its made to be made. Just expose the story, puts some nice scenes, and move on. Where as previous series had better character development and intensity to its plot events, this new series really missed its mark. Like the first episode could have been done so much better when the war began as mentioned in its anime description, but the ANIME decided to rush the story pace just like the manga! The manga can get away with bullet point events, but c'mon, the anime is where the manga can be improved, extended, and refined. I was seriously disappointed about the pace. Overall, awesome 13 episodes reflecting the first introduction to the war. I know it wasn't easy to start off with such intense fight scenes, but they at least managed that. The art, 100/10 can't even complain. But the production as a whole feels lackluster.

"The color design is so dogshit. The attempts to make the lighting and coloring realistic may work on other shows but in Bleach it doesn't. The old charm and colorful vibrant design of Bleach is lost and so is the style. The style was the strong point of Bleach and if that is lost then people will just see it as a generic shonen which it is currently. The color design in the 2021 reveal trailer was perfect. Too bad they changed it to something so dogshit. Also, the writing is abhorrent. They promised to add more things but the added content (which is barely anything) is worthless if you add 1 thing and remove 50 important things. They should re-hire the old Bleach script writers like Mr. Masahiro Okubo. Why are they working on Boruto? No one watches that. Call them back and get them to work on Bleach. Bring back the omake segments like Quincy Encyclopedia, Shinigami Zukan etc. Stuffing 5 chapters/episode and rushing through so much. I could tolerate the horrendous color designs but the writing makes this show unwatchable when you see scene after scene after scene, 400 lines of dialogue per episode, randomly placed ED, 3 min recaps (ep. 4), long post-credits sequences etc. Whoever is currently writing this is not a good writer. The only positives of this cour were some backgrounds in episode 1 and 13 and the new orchestral OST from Mr. Shiro Sagisu. I thought this would be the definitive way to experience TYBW arc and I thought it would be like Hunter x Hunter 2011 with 100+ episodes and a well paced series but this is so off the mark.",5,Not Recommended,"Jan 12, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_12bc3e9fa8,12
"Holy peak, Batman! This season covering the “Thousand Year Blood War” arc is “Bleach” operating at its highest level (or rather, highest spiritual pressure). The animation and music is flawless. The action contained within episodes 1-7 is arguably the most thrilling and devastating that the anime has featured thus far. And even when it shifts its focus more towards story rather than fights after the mid-season finale, it graces these stories—both present time and flashbacks—with roughly half a dozen insane lore drops that might leave your jaw on the floor. This 2022 season of “TYBW” is undoubtably the best arc of the anime since its earlier hitter “Soul Society.” While later arcs also had great moments, much of them suffered from egregiously slow pacing. “TYBW” passed the test of overcoming this flaw with flying colors; and this is coming from someone who watched the last 1/3 or so of the original series at 2x speed. Now I have returned to both watching at 1x speed and actively looking forward for what comes next.

It should've been 24 episodes season, but they compressed it into 13 episodes cour. Little time is given to other characters like Inoue, Kon, Urahara. Also, we see the backstory of Ichigo's parents and Ishida's parents.

"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen After the first 3 episodes had actually impressed me and I immediately had to write a ""positive"" review about it, the remaining 9 episodes made me do the opposite. There was much talk about the anime fixing many of the manga's problems with changes and improvements. I'm still waiting for that. The intro of this season was decent, it built up suspense and curiosity and the studio did a good job of pacing. Unfortunately, everything changed with the beginning of the invasion of the Soul Society. From then on it was just a mediocre spectacle. The Quincy invasion was a complete mindless act of mercy. It was meant to show how dangerous and deadly these enemies are, yet they failed to kill a captain even though they had every chance to do so. Especially with some strong Sternritters present like Bazz-B who could have wiped out half of Gotei 13 while not possessing any Bankai. Instead he did nothing because it would be stupid if the main characters died. And the only one who had an oversized deathflag (Byakuya) just survived? They spent half an episode making it look like a Death, only for an Unnamed NPC to come along and say ""Don't worry he's alive lol :3"" The fights between the Captains and Sternritters felt so forced and weird, a questionable mix of too rushed and yet too little screentime. You could have made every one of these fights almost off-screen and nothing would have changed in the course of the season, except that the pacing would probably be improved. Because Gotei 13 is only made up of weenies, they just waited for Kurosaki-kun for the next 2 episodes. And that was really it, these 3-4 episodes had absolutely nothing, they were soulless and empty. After the final conflict between the two leaders began, you might have thought that the interesting part was about to begin. In the end, Yamamoto only fought with a cosplayer and lost as usual. Yamamoto is a character with so much hype who is only there to make bad and wrong decisions. And after the end of the arc, Yhwach of all people had to tell us the Yamamoto lore and why the fight ended the way it did. There is no worse writing than using the enemies as a narrator to explain something. Well that ended the bad part of the season. From then on there was the Zaraki training arc? If you can call it that, which was relatively surprising and interesting. Also the backstory of Ichigo's parents, which was practically the most interesting part of this season. This part gave the story much more depth and tied up some loose ends. It also successfully promoted the ""Aizen Partner Finding Service"". [Conclusion 6] I was really looking forward to the new Bleach season because I had forgotten what Bleach was like over the years. This season helped me remember that Bleach is really just a big pot of shounen cliches and fan service adorned with epic music and cool fights. I'm happy with what I got, but on average it was a pretty meager result. My hope lives on that the upcoming seasons will be able to make up for the horror of the manga.

"Bleach has always been one of my favorites. It was such a treat to watch the anime finally adapt the story closer to the manga while also correcting some pacing problems and fleshing a few things out further. From the moment this cour started, I was swept back up into the universe so easily and I wasn't disappointed with what the anime offered this time. That said, I won't truly know how I feel about this final act of Bleach's anime until we reach the end of it and see if they add things and overcome the damaage the drama with Shueisha did to the manga back in the day. That said, I'm glad it came back. I loved the use of color to accentuate emotion especially the emotions swirling inside Ichigo. I can't wait for the next part. If you grew up with Bleach, this is definitely an anime you will wnt to check out. If you didn't and you're interested in the serries, I would recommend, if you choose to watch the anime instead of read the manga be aware some things will shift in this arc as the characterizations and stakes align more closely with the manga.",8,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_318ce5b402,12
"Coming back to anime after nearly half a decade, I've been excited to catch up. All that time has allowed quality shows to pile up, and near the top of my to-watch list was the supposedly-astounding adaptation of Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War Arc. I was a massive Bleach fan when I was a teenager. I read the manga all through Soul Society, and I followed the story as the Arancar arc came out, bit by bit. However, by the time Aizen had been sealed up, so had my enthusiasm. After a fascinating start, Bleach had steadily devolved into a smoosh of power-level nonsense, deus-ex power-ups, and no meaningful thematic throughlines. However, what offended me more than all of that, was Bleach's sheer level of predictability. See, I'm actually a big battle shonen fan, and I can forgive most flaws in a good one as long as it doesn't commit the crime of being boring. Bleach, though? Bleach got boring. Every relevant plot point was resolved by a fight. The fight was decided before the outcome based on the direction the story was headed and how important the characters were. The importance of the fight determined how many back-and-forth twists occurred before the inevitable end of the fight. The world of Bleach: its politics, quirks, hierarchies, and more, were all completely irrelevant, and it wasn't worth investing in them because at the end of the day the solution to every major problem boiled down to 'how hard can these guys swing these swords,' with Ichigo's sword being the swingiest and most big. Whenever there was a new power to be had, Ichigo would get it, assembling a collection of unbeatable powers in the dullest way possible: he is fast and can swing big sword strong. Ya kidding? That's it The only exception is Urahara, who actually had PLANS that DID things to affect the story. But he wasn't around much. Enter Blood War. I was stoked. No, really. My impression was that this was the arc when Bleach got back on track, its Chimera Ant-style magnum opus which focused on more than just 'how big and strong is Ichigo's sword' and instead developed the bloody and sordid history of Soul Society and all of the generational violence and hatred between the Soul Reapers and the Quincies in a way that was interesting and thought-provoking. There's so much you can do with a story like this! How did these layers of resentment get written into both sides? How does this conflict test the loyalties of those who straddle the line? Maybe the conflict isn't 'the world is ending' this time, but is instead about how to put an end to a millennium of mutual bloodshed? Maybe Ichigo can take a more interesting role: not that of 'big sword swing guy' but instead of diplomat, leaning into Ichigo's character strength of rejecting revenge and anger as motivators and pursuing truth. Maybe we can get more about the captains, and juxtapose them against their predecessors to show how they both still embody the ruthless ideals of the first Gotei 13 while also showing how much of their bloodlust they've actually lost over the years. Maybe we can get more about Quincy society in a nuanced way, and showcase the ways in which it is both superior and inferior to the soul reaper world. Maybe we can have an antagonist who is as sympathetic as they are terrifying. Maybe... Maybe we can scrap all of that, and do the same shit all over again. Gah, what a disappointment. The adaptation is beautiful, no doubt, and the quality is super high, but the story is just so freaking boring. Any pretense of nuance is quickly dropped: the Quincy King is just a total piece of shit who everyone hates, the soul reapers are the good guys who had no choice but to stop the crazed Quincy actions, and we quickly find ourselves in the same position as always. There's a super strong guy who needs to be beaten by a guy with a big sword, so Ichigo sets off to go get new better stronger powers while we fill the time until the inevitable sword-swinging showdown with lots of side fights with all the captains and lieutenants and such. Most of the new antagonists are just one-note bit characters with nothing to offer. Most are also raging psychopaths to give the conflicts zero nuance. Any Quincies that are likeable switch sides and join the soul reapers, so that we don't have any interesting conflicts. Long gone are the days of Ichigo versus Zaraki, where both sides were likeable. Now it's just 'what total piece of shit is Renji going to fuck up so that he can look cool?' It's dull, it's repetitive, and I'm over it. If you liked the Arancar arc, you'll like this one. It's probably a bit better at doing what that arc did. There are a sprinkling of character backstory episodes given throughout, and some of them are kind of interesting. However, if you were like me and that arc's monotony burned you out, I am sorry to say that we are not in uncharted territory. Blood War hasn't finished airing yet, but in 39 episodes it has done nothing to surprise or interest me. Instead, it has done its best to steadily remove every intriguing element so that we can eventually reach our final line-up of important fights between the 'good guys' and the 'crazy genocidal freaks.' Some Blood War. It's just 'let's stop Hitler' written from the Allies' perspective, except Ichigo's repertoire of moves are somehow more dull than trench warfare.",3,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0f29246b72,12
"Review Date: 21/4/2025 Rewatching this series made me truly appreciate how awesome the Bleach series has become. It's been over a decade since Bleach finally decided to follow-up the last arc they did, the Fullbringer arc. While me reading the entire manga adaptation of this arc fully spoiled me of this, the anime adaptation definitely went above and beyond here. What the manga adaptation certainly didn't have was the emotion and hype. The anime adaptation damn near provided this in its best way with the camera cuts, impressive animation and even additional frames. While the dialogue mostly stayed true to the source material, I found it unique how the battle scenes were as special as it was depicted. The current style trumps whatever the style Bleach was using in the 2000s or even the 2010s. Tite Kubo, the creator, has created the best anime of 2022 easily and this was a sequel. A sequel to a somewhat disappointing arc to most (I found it to be good enough). Obviously I already know what will happen but I'm expecting this anime to reach even greater highest in the second part of the arc which funnily enough I haven't even watched. Overall, banger arc to an already classic Shounen anime.",10,Recommended,"Apr 20, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_b7efdffd6f,12
"The anime took an entirely different approach from Bleach and hence felt like something entirely new. The writing improved drastically and the plot never felt dragged out. The writers always knew what to do and always took risks and extreme turns in many points in the story for the sake of entertainment and development. During the whole time I was sitting at the edge of my seat, and as a viewer, I generally felt a lot more appreciated by this than I ever felt by Bleach during my initial viewing of it. The story also covers a lot of things that in the initial anime (most likely intentionally) were left unanswered, and sometimes even unasked. Without this, I feel a lot of us would be left confused on many aspects of Bleach. A lot of new things are introduced, but just in the right way for us to understand it all without being overwhelmed.",7,Recommended,"Jul 27, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_7eb4cf1307,12
"Great fight choreography, great animation, decent good character development. did i say Flashy fights? but the issue with Bleach is still the same, Bland Villain. A primarily fight based anime with mediocre story at best can't be GREAT unless there's a great freaking Villain to duo with the Hero. Ichigo does his job very very well, but the bland generic villain with generic plot just makes it above average anime with great fight sequence at best. Also the feelings are kinda forced down your throat, not exactly organic. The comedy feels generic as well. So there's that. It's Bleach, so you knew what you are getting into. Great fun while it lasts, that's it.",7,Recommended,"Dec 28, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_b70b1a86ae,12
"I've been a Bleach fan for a long time, but I was one of those who thought it should have ended right after beating Aizen. It felt like an ending that respected its own storytelling and world, without needless plot twists every single moment. That's when I guess Kubo was pressed to keep on writing, and it shows. I didn't like the Fullbring arc, and I also didn't enjoy what I read of this arc. Every new plot thread was almost completely unforeshadowed, right out of nowhere, and it feels like the series is making fun of its own world that had been so interestingly set up in the beginning (especially the Zero Division, I really hate that they're such one-note characters and so extremely and unnecessarily wacky). Nevertheless, this season was a treat to watch as a Bleach fan. From the animation, to the remixed OST, the opening and the ending, everything feels like so much care and attention was taken to make this. This was made by Bleach fans, for Bleach fans. And it kinda made me enjoy the arc a bit more, even if the essential problems I have with it are still present. I can't recommend this season enough if you've watched the old Bleach series.",7,Recommended,"Dec 31, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_e9a085a16a,12
"If like me you looked forward to Bleach continuing, even after a long long break, then here it is/was. I was one of those many Years ago, who continually searched the Internet, asking, Is Bleach returning?? I listened to various Conspiracies as why it was and why it wasn't, that was before i joined MAL. Well here is why i'm not as pleased as i thought i would be. What i did not like. The horrible Greyish dark color scheme they have used throughout. Imagine looking out your window at twilight, you can see things, but it's not very clear. That is today's Bleach. The Character designs, everyone seems to be least a foot taller, especially Ichigo & Kenpachi. they all look stretched out and pointy. The sometimes still pictures used instead of animating, they must have spent a fortune on production costs, so Why?? I could go on but this is what has stuck with me since finishing weeks ago. So what did i like?? Seeing all the characters again after so long. That this is beginning of the end of the storyline. I am actually a fan of Bleach, having watched the whole original series many times, even really liking the Zanpakuto Rebellion Arc, but not the horrible Fullbring Arc. After waiting so long and being slightly disappointed, i stopped watching weekly and finished the last 4 episodes in one go. There is no way this is a top 10 rating, i think everyone's anticipation got the better of them and they rated it so high because of this. So, in Years to come people will be asking themselves, did i really give this a 10, Mmmmm? Yes you did.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_2b774628a0,12
"Continuing on from where the anime left off 10 years ago, we finally get an anime adaptation of the final arc. Such great news! Or is it? Over the first 11 episodes from the time of this review we follow the story as written in the manga, however overall each episode covers like 5 chapters and a lot of the comedy and ecchi scenes have been removed as well as a few other changes leading to the anime feeling rushed. Some people might say ""it's a war arc so the comedy and ecchi may seem out of place and take away the seriousness of the arc's events"", but that's bullshit, just because a war is going on doesn't mean people automatically lose their personality. Overall the anime is certainly exciting and enjoyable, but in the end it falls short of the manga where the events covered were done better and the characters weren't so plain. So, go read the manga instead.",7,Recommended,"Dec 22, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_e785f0d331,12
"I’ll keep it short and simple. The animation is amazing in this however I can’t in good faith give a higher score than a 7 because the actual plot, storyline and pacing was pretty terrible. The whole thousand year blood war arc in general was poorly written. I am and will always be a huge fan of the major arcs that are so much better such as the soul society arc and wako mundo arc. It’s sad to see the original anime have a much lower score than this arc simple because of the animation. I’m still going to watch the rest of the thousand year blood war because I love bleach’s universe and not because of the garbage plot for the this final arc.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_ea54c25f13,12
"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen is a bit of a mixed bag. The pacing of the series is uneven, with some episodes feeling like filler and others rushing through important plot points. The animation is decent but fails to bring the story and characters to life in the same way the previous series did. There are many returning characters, however little time is spent on them and the viewer is expected to know who everyone is. There are also new characters who are introduced but they lack the depth and complexity of those from previous seasons. Overall seeing fan favorite characters return is not enough to offset the animation and pacing inconsistencies. Fans of the series will likely enjoy the return of Bleach but first time watchers will most likely struggle to become invested in the story.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_82a813ede6,12
"Definitely worth watching if you like Bleach (minus all of the filler arcs of course), everything is the same except better. More story, better looking fights, OP bankais finally being shown off that everyone has been waiting for. So why did I select mixed feelings? There's actually one thing that's different. Bleach has always stretched the content out longer than it needs to be (like most shounen do), but it's always been enjoyable. But this time, the content has been rushed. Hard. This easily could have been 20 episodes and it would've been better for it. There wasn't enough time to fully enjoy anything as it lasted a few minutes and then the next thing is thrown at you or the episode ends and the next episode starts off somewhere else. I could feel the time crunch multiple times throughout. There were multiple parts that could have been 1-2 whole episodes but instead were 3-5 minutes. I don't know if they locked in 13 episodes and couldn't change it later, or if they just decided that they were going to make it all fit no matter what, but it hurt the story. There's one word I'll hate to see being stomped into the dirt even more, the once bright, golden ""masterpiece,"" but this isn't a bad show either. Certainly a lot closer to it than many other shows I've seen labelled so in the past year or so by the kiddies.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 22, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_ad8e010387,12
"Edit: TYBW started off weak and got significantly better. The last 6 episodes are especially good and surprisingly better than the Manga. Bleach should have ended with the defeat of Aizen. It was the perfect ending: Ichigo sacrificing his powers and losing his connection to the spiritual world in exchange for defeating the greatest evil. Instead what we got was the Fullbringer Arc that nobody wanted but got anyway; followed by the Thousand Year Blood War that everybody wanted but turned out dissapointing. The bad: 1. Everyone has already mentioned this but the pacing is terrible. Sometimes it moves too quick and you get a number of amazing scenes squished together, sometimes it moves at a snails pace with nothing important happening. 2. Why is every shot a close up? Everything is scene is up close to the characters and most of character interaction is either waist up or a head shot. The directing makes everything feels cramped and claustrophobic. 3. The dialogue can be really weird at times. ""Oh hey Inoue. I can see that Chad is also with you. Hey Chad?"" I keep thinking that this is not how people talk as I continue watching. 4. The classic shonen power scaling dilemma. When you have a villain as powerful as Aizen and your only way of one-upping that is by creating a stronger villain, you end up with a conflict that feels unrealistically one-sided. If the Gotei 13 could not defeat Aizen (just barely with Ichigo), what chance do they stand with Yhwach? The good: 1. The visuals are stunning every 4 episodes or so. 2. Amazing voice acting. 3. Fun reveal of everything Bleach like Yamamoto's and Kyoraku's Bankais. 4. The new story lines are very interesting such as squad zero and the soul king. Overall summary: TYBW is a decent watch, especially fun for hardcore Bleach fans (AKA anyone reading this).",8,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 5, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_66cc974514,12
As a manga reader I was really excited for this arc to get animated but I definitely feel it is being rushed and originally figured the arc would go about 24 episodes but by the looks of it they're gonna finish it up in 13? I'm not surprised its rushed being limited to that and I'm sad that it didn't get as many as it should've. Its been a looong time but up to ep 8 I feel like alot of fights were only touched on or even completely skipped. I'll do a full review once it is finished but so far I'm a little disappointed as I thought the arc would get a full animation but so far this feels more like just a rushed summary of the main stuff that went down.,7,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 29, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0f2db3d72d,12
