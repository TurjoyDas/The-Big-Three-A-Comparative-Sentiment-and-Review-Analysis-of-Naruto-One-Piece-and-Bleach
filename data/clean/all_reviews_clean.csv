"To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

"I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers... When I was 13 years old, I remember watching and loving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old. Then again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet. What I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens. All in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.",7,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_29452877f3,1,1598
"Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade. What I love bout naruto is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away I look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters. Kishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be ""recognized"" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament. Watching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards ""omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already"" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names. One of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree. The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love. 10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today. I still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists. I guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I my self im not a huge fan of typical shonene tropes that are used consistently, but i love how the original series gave us a much more powerful emotional impact to the show. In away it felt more humanized as apposed to the more generic super power elements of shipuuden.",10,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2e4e6db105,1,4028
"I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess ""unadulterated"" is a strong word but I digress.. In any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. *Also, let it be known that the infamous ""Filler Arc"" is not part of this review. Naruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the ""mentor"" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz. The main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an ""idiot"" like most people tend to. Sakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the ""useless female"" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. Sasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to ""kill a certain man"" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc. As far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series. But, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. It also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing. One thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though ""friendship overcoming tragedy"" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show. Now this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves mentioning as it is annoying. The plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun. But, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better. I think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. The Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. In Summary: Story: 7 It takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes. Art: 8 First off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however. Sound: 8 Orochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic. Character: 8 Depending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama. Enjoyment: 9 Hell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. Overall: 8 To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. *If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past.

"ok so I've seen like 200+ series and i have to say that this is one pathetic series. i watched up to shippuden 50. im telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway. the plot is seriously lacking and its a pathetic excuse for a slice of life/action-drama type of show. im writing this for people who legitimately haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all. the characters are even worse. you have your over-zealous,untalented guy who thinks he can do anything if he tries hard enough. . .and he just so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. look people this has been done MILLIONS! of times before so please if you haven't seen the series don't watch it. it will waste days of your life away for nothing. . .literally the series will take up 88 hours of your life! thats over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive. hell, it doesn't even have to be productive. you could probably have a better time watching paint dry! listen to me people, for gods sake i only watched as far as i did out of obligation to finish a series i started but it wasn't worth it! so PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!",1,Not Recommended,"Dec 19, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c521ad62f3,1,1616
"I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time. So is it really? Well, that depends on who you ask. Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover. Story (10/10) - Ok, a lot of people gripe about the story of Naruto, saying it's cliche, moves too slowly, isn't interesting, or whatever. I have to admit, some of these complaints are well-founded. So why did I give it a 10/10? Because the story is so complex and well-done. A lot of this won't become obvious until Naruto: Shippudden, but this is a review of the original series, so, I digress. Naruto is set in a fictional universe where Shinobi (Ninja) are basically the entire cast. Most Shinobi aren't mercenaries, but instead, fight to protect their village, and complete missions to earn money for it. The main character is one such Shinobi, name ""Naruto"" (hence, the name of the series). Naruto is a rebellious, disrespectful, punk, yet he still wants to become a great ninja. He even aspires to become ""Hokage"" (the lead ninja of his village). While this may sound pretty cliche, you'll quickly realize that Naruto has a long way to go before he has any hope of becoming Hokage. This series goes through a lot of twists and turns. The story is too complicated to try to explain in this review, but the further along you go, you'll find that Naruto aspirations aren't easy to live up to. In the very first arc, Naruto and his companions are confronted by a powerful Shinobi who wants to kill the man they have been assigned to protect. The battle that ensued is what got me hooked on this show. The fights in general are nothing short of brilliant. If you like action, this anime is for you! The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to stop until you see how the fight is concluded. I also enjoy watching the characters learn new moves and apply them in combat situations. You'll see Naruto change from an annoying little punk, to a ninja who people actually start to respect for his perseverance and strength. Now, for the things people gripe about in this show. Oftentimes, a fight scene will be interrupted by a flashback or monologue, and this can get dull at times. I didn't mind so much the first time around, but it does hurt the rewatch value a bit. The story can move slowly at times, but most of the slowness is because of how complex the story truly is. The further you go, the deeper you'll see things get. Another thing people gripe about is the length. While it's true that 220 episodes is quite an undertaking, it's really not necessary to watch more than the first 135 episodes. Yes, you heard me correctly friends. The last 85 episodes of the show are nothing but a desolate wasteland, inhabited by nothing but the pile of vomit known as ""filler"". I only watched the first 40 episodes of filler before I'd had enough, and skipped on to Shippudden. Some of the filler arcs are truly terrible. You'll sit back and wonder how the creators of the show had the audacity to slap the name ""Naruto"" to the garbage you've been viewing (if you're brave enough to bother watching it). Hence, my review only covers the non-filler portions of the show. Do yourself a favor and skip the filler. It really isn't worth your time. Art (7/10) - Here the show isn't as strong. While the art is never distinctly poor, it's also not great either. I suppose at times it can't be helped when making a series as long as this one. The animation is often stepped up for fights, or more intense parts of the show, which does help considerably. The art is at least passable, and I was never really bothered by it. Definitely not a show you watch for the eye-popping scenery, though. Sound (7/10) - I must say that I really did enjoy the music at first. While it tended to use synthesizers a bit more than I cared for, it still distinctly fit the mood of the show. Some of the battle music was catchy, and managed to combine electric guitar with more traditional sounding string or wind instruments. However, the creators of the show didn't seem to think it was necessary to update their musical score once in awhile. This wouldn't have been a problem if the show wasn't 220 episodes long. Music that I had once enjoyed, began to grow a bit overused by the end of the series. It never grew to the point of bothering me, but had the show gone on much longer before the filler started, I might have thought differently. The music is good, just used for a few too many episodes. The voice acting was easily good enough for me as well. Not outstanding, but never distinctly bad either. Just don't watch the dubbed version. Naruto's voice alone will be enough to drive you insane. Character (9/10) - Getting to know the cast can be a bit daunting at first. I've never taken the time to count, but there must be at least 30+ characters who get a decent amount of screen time in this show. While this sounds very cumbersome, it actually helps the show quite a bit. each character has their own unique back story and their own battle techniques. While one might think that ninja from a particular village all use the same techniques, this couldn't be further from the truth. The styles of combat are so diverse, that it makes for some VERY interesting fight sequences. Sometimes one character is at a distinct disadvantage, and is forced to out think his opponent in order to win. If it weren't for the brilliantly done fights and interesting characters, this show would lose a lot of it's value. There is one drawback to all of these characters, though. Sometimes, a somewhat minor character will have a flashback in the middle of a fight. It does help to have some context for why they fight, but it gets old at times, especially if it's a minor character that no one really cares about. Despite this problem, the show does a good job of somehow making you hate a character in the beginning, and totally changing your opinion of them at one point or another. I can think of several examples of this. Another problem is that some of the main characters (aka Naruto) are kind of annoying. Naruto is honestly a complete moron in the beginning, and you probably won't like him much at first. He gets better as things go along, but you'll still cringe at him a few times early on. Another annoying character is the lead female: Sakura. Sakura spends the entire series being obsessed with Sasuke (the third member of Naruto and Sakura's three-man team) and never really does anything worthwhile. She spends her time sitting on the sidelines of fights and cheering for Naruto and Sasuke (she gets better in Shippudden, but once again, this isn't a Shippudden review). While this didn't bother me at first, it got kind of annoying when all Sakura could do for the entire series was yell ""Sasuke, Sasuke!"" But anyway, moving right along. Their sensei, Kakashi, is very calm and cool, and helps to balance out this team of knuckleheads. Naruto's an idiot, Sakura's useless, and Sasuke's a child prodigy, yet somehow, Kakashi turns them into a functional ninja team. An impressive feat, if you ask me. To sum it up, whatever shortcomings these characters have, you'll still find yourself rooting for them as they are put through fight after fight, trying to protect their village, the people they love, and what they believe in. For every character that annoys you, there will be at least one that you genuinely love. Even though I did a lot of complaining about the three central characters, I still found myself rather attached to them by the end of the series. The characters will do a good job of making you laugh throughout the series, and it helps to lighten the mood when you sometimes least expect it. As you can see based on the 9/10 I gave the characters, I definitely grew to like them. Despite all the complaints people have, the characters are still very well done. Enjoyment (10/10) - It's hard to be objective on this part of the review. I enjoyed it tremendously, but there are plenty of people who don't. I'd say give it a chance and see what you think. You'll probably know whether or not you'll like the show after the first arc is finished, which is about 17 episodes. Overall (10/10)- Were we on a slightly more precise scale, I might give it a 9.5. I've already said that I enjoyed it a lot, but let me try to sum things up for you: Pros: Lots of action! There are a lot of very well-done fights, which is one of the strongest points of the show. The characters are a good bit better than average, with a few annoying exceptions. The story is long, and complex, but very good. Cons: It's a long anime. 135 episodes (non-filler) for just the original series is a sizable undertaking. Some of the main characters are a bit on the annoying side, and it takes a few episodes before they grow up a little. The long filler arc at the end also turns people off, especially those who feel compelled to watch an entire anime without skipping the filler. Hopefully this helps! Thanks for reading!

"Proof that I will watch just about anything, or rather that I once had nothing better to do than watch this crap while waiting for Squidbillies to come on (Unknown Hinson fangirl). In either case, there are few anime out there that evoke a visceral reaction like Naruto. Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. See, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school. Naruto is about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me. What is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited. Honestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead. This is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like ""the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!"" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change). I just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.

"Having watched many different series of anime, I can understand why the &quot;elitest&quot; out there give this series a bad review; however, I can also say they're flat out wrong and biased. Naruto is a fantastic anime that doesn't get due credit where it's deserved. First off, it's true that the fillers of this anime that take up about the last 1/3 of this Part 1 are flat out terrible. With the exception of the first two arcs (including the amazing Bikouchi retrieval arc) they're probably the worst anime I've ever seen and the fillers in Naruto Shippuden are just as bad. But I think as anime watchers, we should recognize fillers when we see them and simply ignore them. The anime itself is well-done with some of the most memorable tunes you will ever hear. I currently have one of the everyday tunes as my cellphone jingle - it's that catchy. The plot is original and fun, which is why Naruto has taken off to such enormous heights. The characters are all amazing and it's common knowledge that Kakashi and Itachi are two of the most bad-ass characters of all time in any anime. Everyone can find a character to relate to. From the lovable Rock Lee and Hinata to the inpalpable Gaara and Sasuke, we all find something to cheer for or hold onto in this anime, making it addicting. Those who give this anime a bad review refuse to acknowledge the points that make this one of the greatest and most popular anime of all time. It's their loss. Yu-Gi-Oh was the same way. You accept it or you don't, but if you don't like it, most people will disagree with you, which makes you wrong by consensus. Try the first 15 episodes and give it an honest try. By the time the Kakashi/Zabuza fight rolls around, you might just get hooked. Don't say I didn't warn you.",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e07a6a7adb,1,1763
"This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series. Now that's saying a lot. Ok now on to some of the things that made it so bad. First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago. Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place. Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas. Which wouldn't have been so bad had the creators focused on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action. Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary. Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters. I'll focus on Naruto. He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series. Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show. The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke. Ok moving on to the so called action. First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes. Finally there's the length of the so called series. There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs. I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money. Now don't get me wrong I know studios are trying to make money, but theirs a difference between making money and ripping people off. So please don't support this show anymore.",1,Not Recommended,"Oct 30, 2007",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bc974426e0,1,1671
"Naruto is a hit or miss show. You love it, or you hate it. I mean, how many times have you heard from Narutards calling it &quot;the best anime ever&quot;? How many times have you heard from Naruto haters calling it &quot;the worst anime ever&quot;? Both have ruined the Naruto fan base, so now no one pays attention to Naruto anymore. I hope this review will get at least one person to try Naruto, even if it turns out they don't like it. The story is basically about the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, and his journey on becoming the greatest ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village. No one believes that Naruto can do this, seeing how this is because Naruto is a hooligan due to the loss of his parents at a young age, and how no one is friends with him because Naruto has a kyuubi, or demon fox, sealed inside of him that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto isn't officially a ninja yet, so he takes the ninja test. He fails the test by his teacher, Iruka. Later, the other teacher in charge of the Ninja Academy, Mizuki, tells Naruto he can pass the test if he can get the ninja scroll, which is actually a scroll with every ninja jutsu known to man. Mizuki is actually taking the advantage of Naruto to take the scroll and destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. Iruka hears about this, and challenges Mizuki in combat, but is unable to win. Naruto then challenges Mizuki to combat after Iruka loses, even though Mizuki has the advantage, Naruto defeats Mizuki because he studied a technique in the scroll. Naruto is now able to not only clone himself with the jutsu, but able to clone about 100 of himself. Iruka then passes Naruto as a ninja, and is put in squads with Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Kakashi Hatake, the team leader who is the second closest ninja in the whole series. After Naruto is put in squads, the series moves on to arcs, the Zabuza arc, the Chunin Exam arc (which basically every character in the Naruto series is introduced), the Orochimaru arc, the Jiraiya arc, and the Tsunade arc. All those arcs last up to episode 100. Even though Naruto has a basic story, each episode has it's own story to it, making each episode unique in it's own way. I therefore like Naruto's story because of this, which makes episode to episode enjoyable. The art from Naruto isn't superb, but this probably because the anime was made in 2002. But this is an excuse, because the anime Fruits Basket was made a year before Naruto, and had superb art. The art looks basic, like One Piece and Bleach's art style. Naruto is a ninja anime, but if you couldn't tell already, none of the characters in Naruto look like ninjas. I mean, orange jumpsuits? Have you ever seen a ninja in an orange jumpsuit? Basically none of the characters wear black and cover their face with a mask, except for Kakashi, but that's his personal preference, not because the creator wanted one character to look like a ninja. Even though the art improved throughout the series, the animation still had plainness to it, so therefore I can't give the animation a great score. The soundtrack that waws in Naruto was pretty good, and it fits in parts where it needed to be. A lot of people don't really enjoy the soundtrack, but I think the composers did a great job on the upbeat themes for combat and sad music for dramatic moments. And the voice acting was good for each character in both dubbed and subbed versions. Naruto has an arrogant whiny voice, Sakura has a self-sufficient bitchy voice, Sasuke has an assholish angry voice, and Kakashi has a leader-type of voice. I would go more on to voice acting of other characters, but there are too many characters to list. Now on to the characters. There are a lot of good characters in Naruto, but some characters ruin great parts of the show. Naruto is a great main protagonist, who won't stop until he gets what he wants. Kakashi is a great leader, and always puts others before himself. Both Hinata and Neji Hyuuga are great characters for being strongly developed with the story line and courageous, and Tenten for being the closest of a ninja in the anime. Now some of the characters I don't really like. Sakura is bitchy and whiny, all she does is &quot;ADORE&quot; Sasuke, and is a useless ninja. Ino Yamanaka, because she is the most useless character in almost any anime, and Shikamaru Nara, for being boring. Therefore the characters I didn't like didn't necessarily ruin the series, but it sure didn't improve it. I'm just going to say it, Naruto is one of my favorite animes, and almost my favorite anime series. Even though I didn't give everything a perfect score, there is one thing I can give a 10- enjoyment. I enjoyed almost every single bit of Naruto, all the way to episode 220. Naruto might not be perfect, but to me it was perfect enjoyment.",10,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0b864cef3f,1,4792
"Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first 135 episodes. Story: It was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until Sasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part 2] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden) Art: A bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic. Sound: If you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else. Characters: They are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters. Overall: I loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode 135 and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it. 8/10",8,Recommended,"Jan 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_44198d9465,1,2424
"Story: Naruto is a fairly decent anime that made quite a bit of mistakes, such as turning over half of the show into fillers, and taking the show into &quot;god&quot; level Dragon Ball Z style of fighting. Naruto starts out as a extremly good Ninja anime during its first season where everything you see is unexpected and the story is rather fresh and interesting, the first season including Zabuza had a perfect pace and the fight scenes felt truly of what ninjas should be. After the first season however we are left with a quickly declining anime, soon the fights becomes my &quot;special move is better then yours&quot; and it doesnt really feel like its a ninja show anymore with everyone pretty much using random attacks, which essentially turns this show into another beat em up. After a couple of seasons they start to follow in the footsteps of Dragon Ball Z. Art: The characters are well drawn, and the moves are flashy and nicely animated fight sequences. Sound: While many of the music and songs of the anime are amazing, this show became plagued with... DATTEBAYO! ('Believe it' in english) Character: A large array of characters with each a rather decent background, however because they wanted each character to have such a rich and fulfilling history, we became flooded with flashbacks. Also only a few characters truly stand out in terms of growth and development such as Gaara, Neji, Shikamaru and a few others. Enjoyment: I decided to rate the seasons individually and then average them, with Season 1 and 5 recieving highest marks.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 8, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da44cf7bf6,1,1551
"Wow... I look back and realize how painfully mediocre Naruto is compared to all the Anime I have watched recently... Its a shonen series, but it isnt really special... Just another addition to the &quot;boredom-inducing-fillertastic&quot; pile of anime in the end. It seems that many people have overrated this series because it was one of their first series, and they havent really watched many series anyways... -just a thought (All you hardcore fans keep reading, I explain myself) Overall: Naruto had the setup to be something epic, though the length and the way they tell the story completely destroyed what chance they had at becoming epic. They dragged out the story to include useless extra stuff, and though the characters had some depth, they kept trying to add more depth and not really adding much at all, just wasting time. The whole of Naruto is filled with episodes where you dont really get anywhere both in character development and story development, even the non-filler episodes did not do that well in developing the series in general. I admit, I liked watching Naruto at first, when I didnt really have much experience with much anime, now I look back and man does it look like crap compared to things like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion or Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann, or even Black Lagoon, I can understand why people that are fresh into anime are easily turned into &quot;Narutards&quot; now, just like the &quot;Pokemaniacs&quot; back in the day. This series is on a path that leads to a &quot;Inuyasha&quot; kind of standing. Story: Kid wants to be mayor of ninja town, ok thats nice, but has he REALLY gotten much further to ACTUALLY becoming &quot;Hokage&quot; in the last 200+ eps of this roundabout story? fillers killed what little naruto had in story. The way they stretched the story to encompass EVERY LITTLE THING is its main flaw, little side stories are nice and everything, but if you overdo it, you are just adding a giant mass of fat to the bone, no meat. If they just made Naruto something like a 2 season shot or something less then 50 episodes, then there might have been an epic anime that is worthy of being in the group of truly great anime. Art: meh... its not anywhere near as impressive as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with its 30million yen budget per episode, but it at least doesnt have any major flaws, though the art seems pretty bland sometimes, other times, the art is overly complex for what they are trying to show, but usually there isnt much of a problem in art. Sound: i never really liked the kind of atmosphere that the background music made me feel, it wasnt epic, the background music didnt really fit the situations very well, for example the overpowering flute in most of the bmg and the apparent manly &quot;HUA!&quot; that is overused do not really set much of a mood, I understand that there is a theme towards more traditional Japanese type of music, but it doesnt work well in many cases, there are way too many times where it just wont set the mood right and they beat the crap out of the dead horse, its hard to explain very well, Im raising my score to a 5 because AKFG and Sambomaster sang openings for it and they worked well with the anime. Character: There is a very large cast in Naruto, though its usually a bad thing, they made it work somewhat. Even though the characters are somewhat deep, they all consist of cliched stereotypical shonen characters and do not have much to set them apart from the giant mass of other shonen story characters, also nothing EVER changes in the personality of the main character, Naruto, though he is cheerful, optimistic and energetic, he never realizes the reality he lives in and due to a lot of dumb luck and his gift of insane power he passes all his trials and tribulations, he is so naive that it is painful to watch, he almost never has a mature or realistic look on things, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEUD WITH SASUKE, even then he still does not have a mature attitude in many situations. His development is like Arika in &quot;Mai-Otome&quot;, painfully naive, though he doesnt even advance as far as Arika in maturing, at least she somewhat matured throughout the story. There are good characters in the mix, for example, Shikamaru and Garaa are pretty well developed characters that have promise. However with all that said, Naruto kills EVERYTHING in character, its amazing how dumb he is sometimes, dumb to the point where he should get himself checked for mild autism, unfortunately he usually blocks out the possibility of good mature side characters with his obnoxiousness. I guess there was more then one reason people tended to stay away from Naruto, besides the fact he has a fire fox's spirit sealed within him. Enjoyment: it was enjoyable when I started watching it and it stayed that way for about 100 episodes, then it just tanked... now I have no intention of taking this up again. The amount of entertainment is not enough to keep me interested, nothing like Detective Conan, which nearly only uses its entertainment value to keep me interested.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f525698762,1,5092
"Uh what a bad anime. STORY Classic zero to hero story. But it's a very lazy story and full of bullshit. The power balance of the characters is ridiculous. Very weak characters can suddenly get power-ups and be victorious. The relationship between Sasuke and Naruto makes me to my stomach. It seems so fake that people who hate each other so much have weird love. ART The visuals are very bad as they have to shoot so many episodes. There is almost no fighting animation. Have silly word duels. SOUND Naruto's voice is incredibly annoying. Other than that no problem. CHARACTER Oh man... I hate Naruto,Sasuke and Sakura really bad. All of them are incredibly frustrating.

"Naruto, who doesn't know about it? It's a wildly popular series that is controversial-- oh, almost every worldwide-known series is like that. First of all, i just don't get how people keep on complaining about this series. Like, those who gave this series a one-two-three ratings, i wonder what is wrong with them? They better came up with acceptable reasons. And oh-- maybe most of them thought that they're some sort of experts just because they've seen so many other animes besides this (even though they seriously can't make any better show-- note, MAKE-- than this show). I dislike those kinds of ppl that keeps on complaining due to some unclear reasons. And i know that this review might get me hated somehow, but whatever. Here are my thoughts. The story is your stereotypical shounen-ish, capturing a parallel Ninja world, where almost everybody is a ninja and they have some cool superpowers (that's what i call), and there's this weak and stupid main character that eventually grows along the story. To me, the story is a masterpiece. Like, this is one of the first ninja shows at that time, and it pretty much introduced to us how are ninjas like. The main plot itself is unbelievably good (to me, dunno how everyone else feels), a boy that holds some kind of massive power inside of him that remains hidden, but at some moments it will come out. And i also love the idea of making 1-tailed, 2-tailed until 9-tailed monsters, that really got me. Aaand also the awesome techniques and awesome creatures. Until this point, i like almost everything from the story. It quickly catches our attention and it easily makes everyone to sit back and enjoy the show. I watched this show for the first time when i was 10, and like all kids, i instantly got hooked. Indeed, it has some undeniable flaws, like its cliche and guessable story, and maybe some spots of gary stu, to say. But, isn't that all shounen series all about? How the main character who was nothing in the beginning, began to grow and finally becomes something? It was okay enough for me. The fights themselves were also fun and made me eager to watch, and it's even okay to watch it again and again. It's never boring and to me, the story never grows old. Well, Naruto is one of my childhood memories so i might sounded a little bit biased. But that is to me. The characters are-- god, there were like tons of them. Besides the main characters there were absolutely lots of supporting characters that appeared just in some stories and later never showed up again. I absolutely love the way they designed the characters with their unique traits, and note that the design has lots of varieties and i was never bored to see some new characters appearing because they're not the same, they're different. I sometimes thought how could ppl design so many people (because in my case, it's so hard to draw even 10 different faces). Well, Kishimoto looked really professional on designing the characters. Lots of different types of hairstyles (from the normal one until the absurd one), clothes (this one is definitely amusing), and so on. The animation itself is pretty colorful to me, and fight scenes (which is the soul of this series) were drawn neatly. And the sound effects--- for god's sake, i love the BGMs!! There are dozens-- or maybe more-- of sound effects, background musics, and opening-ending song in this anime. 220 episodes is not a short one, and they definitely made it not boring with the music. I could note some songs that i really like coming from Naruto. Toshiro Masuda really, really gave me the thrills with his awesome BGMs whenever we're watching some scenes and then dramatic BGMs that absolutely fits the story begins to play. Music is one of the best aspects in this series, tho. I even downloaded some of them to escort me on doing things. Yeah right. Naruto... is a really enjoyable series. Indeed, as i stated before, it's not perfect. No series are perfect. The best series ever known also came up with some minor flaws. And so is Naruto. Maybe you guys are irritated with the characters, or maybe the typical storyline, or maybe the absurd length of this series, you guys have your own opinions. I'm not a professional or whatsoever, i'm just an ordinary kid who enjoys watching animes. And these are my opinions.",10,Recommended,"Apr 5, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a24770c095,1,4309
"Naruto is my favorite anime series and manga series. I started reading the manga when I was a pre-teen but dropped it after a while, because certain story elements bothered me (such as Naruto's unrelenting love for his rival). However, when I was 17 I picked it up again because I was bored and had nothing to read, I was hooked all over again, part 2 starts slow but it picks up, and when I say that I mean it gets extremely epic and interesting. But this review is about Part 1, and the anime adaption of it. Well, part 1 Naruto tells the story of a young Tom Sawyer-ish trouble maker kid who wants to be a ninja. It doesn't take long for him to graduate ninja school and begin his journey to become a legendary shinobi, however it's not just Naruto to watch this show for, the supporting cast and antagonists, especially in Part 1, are what make this story shine. Some of the most beautifully sad stories I've ever read/seen (in this case seen) are depicted within this anime, and it's just an amazing story that no one should miss. It enthralled me as a child, and astounded me as an adult, the level of thought, symbolism, and hidden details within this story could only be crafted by geniuses, which would be Kishimoto and his editors. All the characters are interesting, have unique personalities, sometime horrific pasts and secrets, and a good lot of them are extremely likable, such as everyone's favorite teacher Kakashi or the goofy underdog with passion Rock Lee. Even some of the most menacing antagonists you'd never think you'd care about, suddenly show that even they are worth your empathy. There's a good reason this is the biggest hit anime series to sweep america, and that's due to the overwhelmingly strong story, characters, and masterfully orchestrated soundtrack. Now, sure it's amazing, but there are negatives, most which are exclusive to the anime adaption and not the manga. While the anime adaption does a great job portraying the most important scenes, with fantastic animation and great music placement and sound, the entire thing isn't this way. This is because different directors and animation teams worked on different parts of the show, so one director could be brilliant, and one could have a lower budget and not be so brilliant, thus the art and execution are inconsistent in areas. That's not the only negative however, this show has these annoying things called fillers, which are additional story arcs added on that weren't part of Kishimoto's original manga. These are pretty cheesy and badly written and should be skipped, except for a particular comedic episode about attempted to remove Kakashi's mask. If you want to enjoy the show to it's full potential these should be skipped, especially the huge lot of them towards the end. Another thing is censorship. In the manga, there are some scenes that are just far to graphic for whatever timeslot the anime aired in Japan, such as a particular scene where a rogue shinobi is has naked corpses hung on the walls and is removing their limbs and dissecting them. Scenes like this are replaced with stuff that's less graphic but still sorta gets the point across. It's a shame such a great anime with a strong soundtrack and legendary source material has such blaring issues, but that's what bumps it down to a 9, it isn't a perfect adaption, has inconsistent art (but great at times) and various other annoying changes or additions that hamper my enjoyment of the Naruto manga in motion. I recommend skipping the fillers for the best viewing experience, but regardless, this is a story you won't forget, with characters you won't forget, moments you won't forget, and feelings you won't forget. There's no score more appropriate for this show other than a 9/10.",9,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_cbdc3e5b31,1,3755
"The mighty roar of a Kyubei vibrated throughout the area as a crowd of ninja from Konoha try their hardest to bring it to its knees. All the fighting is for naught until one person steps up and sacrifices himself to seal the Kyubei away. That man was known as the Fourth Hokage. Years later, a young orphan named Naruto causes much vandalism and trouble, just to get the attention he craves each day. His life goal is to become the next Hokage. Kishimoto Masashi has brought us a very long series of action, drama, and comedy about a young ninja in training known as Naruto. This particular series focuses on the trials and tribulations of the young shounen who has only one life goal in mind: To become the greatest Hokage in Konoha village. Along with Naruto, he has a few friends who he has earned respect from. One such colleague is more of a mentor than a friend, and that certain person is Umino Iruka-sensei. Someone who was similar to Naruto when he was growing up, so he is the first person to understand what Naruto goes through. The next few are Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura, along with their sensei Hatake Kakashi. Now, onto the review of this long, magnificent-until-the-filler-starts series. The animation of the show gets better by season, especially the opening sequence. The only qualm I have about the animation is the fighting sequences. More action, less stalemates, please. A stalemate is good now and then for a dramatic effect, but for nearly every fight starts to become tedious and boring. But I can work with it. It’s crisp and clear, and the designs of the scenery are refreshing because the structures of the villages are unique to their elemental area. Although the best designed character in my humble opinion has to be Temari and Shikamaru. Sure it is a bit of bias, but that’s only because those two are my favorite characters. Seriously, though. I like the thought of including a character such as Rock Lee to pay semi-homage to Bruce Lee. Although I don’t personally like the first opening song, it is a good theme for that season’s setting. The beat and rhythm of the song go well with the atmosphere, which is why it is a good pick by the Naruto crew. However I’ve listened to it too much and I don’t like it as much as when I had first heard it when I first started watching the show. I totally love the second opening song by my favorite J-Rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation. Again, it goes perfect with the atmosphere of the season and with the opening video animation. The third song is a good choice, however the singer is too high pitched to set the right mood of the song. It doesn’t mean I don’t like the song, though. I like it just fine. The singer is just too high pitched, is all. The rest of the songs are mostly J-Rock and their beats are very nice to follow. Fighting Dreamers, the fourth season opener is easy to sing along to, and that’s pretty nice. I won’t go into every single opener, so I’ll just move along to the actual soundtrack. The fighting music is good and gets you into the mood of the fight. Especially the fights Naruto participates in. That music theme is the most catchy that I have heard. But the most depressing fighting music is the theme that plays when the Hyuuga siblings duke it out in the Chuunin exams. It’s a touching match and the song really gets to you when you’re rooting for Hinata, or Neji, if you’re not fond of Hinata. Ah, the story. It is a magnificent story to follow a young ninja warrior’s adventures to becoming Hokage and fulfilling various missions with his group. The most compelling story is the Missing Nin arc featuring Haku and Zabuza. Ah, shounen-ai; Just kidding. These two had a really strong bond with one another except Zabuza didn’t realize it until it was too late. This arc is also the arc where we first see a glimpse of Kyubei Naruto in his first form. Although there isn’t much to say about the main story because the filler takes up most of the series. 135-215, Eesh. That’s a lot of filler. I do have to say that the first few seasons are worth purchasing, though not to purchase the fillers. Ah, the ever various and unique cast of Naruto. There is a character for everyone since the cast of Naruto is so vast; a character that eats a lot, to a lazy character who is a genius tactician. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite characters are Shikamaru and Temari, although Temari is from the Sand Village. One could get a lot of value from this series; especially rewatch value as it is a very long series of 220 episodes. Well, less if you skip the filler, which is highly recommended you do if you rewatch the series, unless you find a filler arc you enjoy, then more power to you. I enjoyed this series, although to be honest I haven’t completed the 220 as of now, I still have 15 to watch to complete this 220 episode anime.

"I laughed, i cried and i was excited. In other words there were everything in this anime what necessary to a long anime like Naruto :) As i was watching it i didn't feel that it was waste i watched such a long anime. I liked Naruto's character so much. Naruto is a freaky, dumb and unlucky person who was always outcasted by the people in the village. However later he became a careful, strong guy who passes everyone's expection and surprise them. He's been helped by his friends and he's able to move forward by their assistance. He thinks Sasuke as a friend during the whole time what they spend together in the Team 7 it's (maybe) because Sasuke is also lonely after he lost his parents. I've learnt a lot from this anime. The voice actors were great. Even though i was surprised that Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's voice still i think she is the best for Naruto. The opening and ending songs fitted to the anime very well. Especially the FLOW songs. I liked almost all of the soundtracks in it. I like its grafic. I suppose it's unique.

"Naruto was the first anime I ever watched. And I'm glad it was. Because if I had watched for example Death Note, I think I wouldn't still be watching anime. Why is that? Naruto isn't a 'hardcore' anime. It is just plain fun and everyone can understand the storyline. While some other animes may be confusing when you first watch them, Naruto is just clear. Very soon I realised what the power of Naruto was. It isn't the story, which is quite cool too, but it are the characters! Everyone has their own story and their own way of thinking. Their own powers and their own weaknesses. This isn't something new in an anime, but Naruto does it in such a great way! It is really touching when someone is about to die, and you feel really glad if one of the main characters won a battle. What too is a great thing, is the whole world. The town feels realistic, although it is in a fantasy world. What I mean is that everything just feels natural and right. All the ninja ranks and how people treat eachother, it feels like a real but different world. The enviroment is beautiful too and is perfect for the battles which will take place there. I have been very, very positive untill now. The negative aspect of Naruto is that there are a lot of fillers. Sometimes they are just plain fun, but I really got annoyed when I found out that the episodes 120 untill about 200 are all just fillers! I quit watching and started Naruto Shippuden without missing anything of the plot. I would recommend this to anyone one who loves action-based animes. It is fun and probably one of the most ass-kicking animes!",9,Recommended,"Jan 10, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da283ddaf7,1,1594
"Hm... Naruto as a series is a difficult one to review. It's almost 'cool' and 'accepted' to say this mainstream anime is overhyped and cliche. If one were to gush about Naruto one would immediately jump to the conclusion that they are a child, naive, or just new to anime. Naruto is a story about a orphan kid who becomes a ninja. If you look at Naruto's story objectively it's actually pretty good. It has all the stuff you would likely want in a story; rivalries, fighting, ninjas, friendship, philosophical moralizing etc... What ultimately makes this shounen different from say a DBZ or a Bleach is that all these things are all woven better into the story making a better cohesive story. There aren't any real devastating plot twists that come from nowhere in Naruto. The most important things that happen are foreshadowed a good deal throughout. Each arc ultimately ties into the next unlike a DBZ and the degradation in story isnt as quick as a Bleach. The story is woven and complete (IMO) throughout the 100+ episodes. The characters in the show is another huge plus. Sure the titular character, Naruto, is irritating but the real strength here is the wealth of background characters in Naruto. Each of them through the series (manga related episodes) are given, for lack of better words, their time to shine. The themes related to each character also makes for interesting dialogue between them. Which brings me to dialogue which is another standout. The tone shifts quite abit through the 150ish episodes but the humor, dramatic scenes, or moralizing/psuedo-philosophical stuff all come off reasonably natural. Next the music is reasonably good. It has a nice feel to the music and it fits the scene pretty well. The theme 'Sadness and Sorrow' is a nice piece but tends to be overplayed in the dramatic places. By now you probably realized that I really liked Naruto, I watched it years ago but I still enjoy watching an episode here and there. I was a little discouraged when people my age were beginning to shut out Naruto for more 'edgier' animes. I dont think someone should put down Naruto because it's a kid show. Sure it's a little silly here and there but ultimately watching it makes a dam good time. I've watched a good share of animes but I have to say Naruto is still the most fun (doesn't mean its the best). Rejecting the things that were important in your youth seems almost natural but in this case it's unwarranted. Watch, enjoy. Rewatch, enjoy more. **This is a review of the ep1- the last manga arc of Naruto disregarding the fillers and Shippuden (which I have not seen- more proof that I'm not just a fanboy... maybe) **",9,Recommended,"Jan 25, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f712b12c3f,2,2652
"First to say: I decided to write a review for one of my favorite animes even though there are more than enough reviews. My anime addiction is indebted to this series because this was the one that invited me to the otaku world... Story (7/10) Naruto's story revolved around a obnoxious kid named Naruto, if you don't like him, then it's not very likely that you'll love the series. The plot is a bit shallow and a bit of a cliche; a stupid main character who wants to attempt the impossible and has a hidden power behind his sadness having stereotypical nakamas to protect. Simply to say it is the journey of Naruto to become the best; however, he has to face conflicts within himself, with others and with the world as well. Don't expect psychology, deep philosophy, and thought provoking issues here because Naruto was made for the general audience and tackles drama within the character's personal lives as teenage ninjas, there are almost no societal issue here and war and politics are not a prominent figure. The story is about lives. The life of a ninja here is portrayed in a comedic and adventurous way in the eyes of mostly innocent youths who in time, will be able to learn about its darkness. But what made Naruto so lovable? It is the universe it created. The villages, the clans and the people's lifestyle are so fun to learn about, they are so fun to be in. Plot twists are plentiful and the characters' interactions are very exciting. But the heart of Naruto fandom is the ACTION; loved characters fighting with their well loved skills. Each of them has unique attributes coming from their bloodline or they developed personally. Most of the time, they think while they fight resulting into exciting clashes of logic and tactics. Their powers also have 'scientific explanations' from the make-up science in this show giving room for countless forums and fan speculations where their strengths and weaknesses are discussed; example is ""who will win if..."" However, I was displeased with the development of the series; it started out really good but after episode 140 or so the anime was filled with useless fillers, totally useless and unenjoyable.They really ruined the show; It was a real disappointment to fans that the transition to Naruto Shippudden was a total disgrace. Overall the story is very addictive and will keep you glued to the screen until the fillers came. Art (7/10) The character designs are very simple yet memorable, no character looked alike and each other and each has trademark outfits, which were not very detailed. Eyes, noses, mouths and hair are nothing special making Naruto characters one of the easiest to draw.I also loved the use of symbols, such as the Konoha leaf and Naruto's spiral, they leave a considerable amount of impression to viewers. The houses, shops, fashion, and art in general in Naruto are both landlord era and modern anime style inspired. Yet the animation was very inconsistent; there are times when faces are so ugly and the action scenes, which are excellent, are poorly drawn (especially at the fillers). Sound (8/10) What I can say about the music of Naruto is that it is appropriate. The music was heavily Japanese themed and gives you a ""ninja"" feel. Though not exceptional it is not disappointing; if the scene is sad, the music will make you even sadder, and when there is action, the music will pump up your adrenalin. The opening and ending themes are quite enjoyable and addictive, making them highly anticipated. But the length of the series made the music overly used and lacking in variation. Character(7/10) This part is very debatable...It is also the part that made Naruto hated by many, the main characters and also some secondary characters) are cliches: A boy who has a hidden power triggered if his nakama is in danger and wins over strong opponents by willpower A rival who is smart with looks better than the main character, fan-girled too much and has some dark undertone. A girl obsessed with the 'rival' who is liked by the unliked main character whom she constantly bullies Mostly the characters are a bit shallow but they are worthy to be loved. Some of them are inspiring, some irritating, some cute, some has psychotic attributes and some are cool depending on a person's preference: a very good formula for a shonen anime. They are not mediocre and their role in the story is noteworthy as many of them develops significantly as the series progresses, whereas each has his or own internal or external conflict. Naruto promotes many important values such as friendship, family, hardwork and maturity with its characters.I find it inspirational and heartwarming. I also loved its concept of having a ""home""and to belong to and having a ""dream"" to work hard for. Overall the atmosphere is positive here. HOWEVER, the fillers made room for too many cheap, sissy dramas and trying-hard-to-be-deep- characters who are very unnecessary. The plentiful unnecessary flashbacks also ruin some climatic parts and made the drama bland. But Naruto isn't very shallow at all. One can see it's unforced efforts to bring symbolism; a character living in bloodshed was associated to the pureness of snow, the blooming of flower as a metaphor for growth, and the leaves of the village compared to the next generation or the progression of time. Angst and sadness is plentiful here but they are viewed from the eyes of pre-teens and pre-teens are mostly shallow no matter how deep they think they are. But it doesn't mean that the drama is shallow, it was just portrayed naturally from the characters' point of view. Naruto, though he is a typical shonen hero, has a different effect on people and has an amazing power to impact both the characters of the show and audiences alike. His development is superb: from a naughty, proud and idiotic outcast kid he strove hard to be recognized by following his way of a ninja to become an inspiration to everybody. Enjoyment (9/10) I loved it so much...I've been addicted to it for three years. Even though I watch new series, Naruto still remain in my top list. My experience in watching this is very different from other shonens, and conversing with fans alike will make you feel very welcomed in loving this series.I can extract endless fun information from the series and fansites. It is just that the fillers really ruined the mood... Naruto is not exceptional in every aspect(except action and comedy perhaps) if you compare it to very artistically done animes but it may be the best in one thing: earning people with unconditonal fandom despite its weaknesses. Isn't it a very rare attribute? ""It's just popular but not really good."" Then why is it popular in the first place? It is because the majority loved it and don't care about its flaws. Naruto is very age-friendly and gender friendly, and a very well composed shonen. So heed my final words: exposure to this material may cause long term addiction OVERALL: 7/10",7,Recommended,"May 5, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ca9aa0e7d8,2,6949
"Naruto is a hit and miss with some people. You can hate or appreciate; that's how it works. Most people say that Naruto is a pretty bad anime, and in reality, it's not. While there are obvious shortcomings and issues, there are also some really good parts in this anime that probably anyone would enjoy. Of course, what is Naruto, really? Well, it's a story about a boy named Uzumaki Naruto, whose dream is to become the Hokage, or, top ninja. This is an incredible feat, of course, and only some one extraordinary could achieve such a feat. However, he is different. Naruto's path is (and will) be very difficult, since an incident many years ago left him with a demon, the Kyuubi, sealed inside his body. The Kyuubi is a beast with exceptional power that nearly destroyed the Village of Konohagure, Naruto's village. His village disgraces him for his powers not because of the boy himself, but out of fear that the power will return one day. Naruto wants to prove the villagers wrong and become Hokage, and protect them. He will, of course, need special training in order to become so, and also the necessary training that all ninja trainees get in order to succeed. Will he? You will just have to watch. Now, what do I think about Naruto? Well, being a USA resident, I was first subjected to the dubbed version all those years ago. I had read The Shonen Jump pilot manga years ago, and with technology not being as advanced as now, watching subbed episodes without importing and learning Japanese was impossible, so I was subjected to watching the dubbed episodes. Of course, being a longtime anime fan, I was not impressed, compared to other anime's that I had watched prior (that were dubbed). My luck changed eventually, and subbing groups were formed and I had gotten what I wanted. The original, un-edited content and blood that the cut-dry dubbed version did not have. Alas, my opinion changed. I was left satisfied and it exceeded my expectations. Now, now. Naruto is not the greatest anime that I've ever seen. However, it does not suck. The character development goes at the speed you would expect it to, and Naruto does leave behind characters that you will remember (and ones that you will want to forget -- Sasuke, anyone?) The animation, amongst other things, is good, and battles in-depth (although it might take some time for the characters to move.. just to waste time, really). Now, the last part comes up to you. Naruto, like I said before, is a hit-or-miss. You either fall in love with the concept, or you hate it to the core. Personally, I don't. I like the ninja action and the plot development. You may not. That's the point - Naruto is what you make of it. It may be the best thing you ever see, or the worst. Now all you need to do is find out for yourself.",8,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7a6ef55c6d,2,2785
"Naruto (not Naruto Shippuden) is awesome. It had a nice setting, character development, plot, and fighting scenes. The thing I enjoyed most about Naruto was its character development. The diverse array of characters in Naruto all (with the exception of Ten-ten and a few other people) had their spotlight and unique identities. I especially liked Naruto because he was the hard-working underdog. You also get these bad-ass fighting scenes. These fighting scenes, I felt, actually made sense. There weren't many nakama-power ups, and the good people didn't always win. Everyone was limited by chakra. You also get some cool strategies! I really enjoyed this series. And even though I don't continue Naruto with the manga or watch Shippuden, I still like to rewatch old Naruto episodes.",8,Recommended,"May 19, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_35348d1b4d,2,784
"Although Naruto is sometimes overexaggerated with the way it has somehow been &quot;stolen from other manga artists&quot; and it isn't creative. Naruto, although very simple character, has a great personality and proves that he is able to do anything so long as he sets his mind to it. With his friends and Konohagakure no Sato behind him, he sets his mind on becoming Hokage, the greatest ninja of the Hidden Leaf Village. That does not omit the fact that Naruto has other infamous characters that are loved. Uchiha Sasuke - the character that every girl seems to love (besides myself. Naruto fangirl here), and the somewhat antagonist of the story was meant to die at the beginning of the series. So far, he seems to always have a way of slipping through everyone's hands, and has a demeanor that just says to everyone he looks at, &quot;Back off.&quot; Haruno Sakura - the girl that has a major crush on Sasuke, who Naruto has a crush on, and with the undeniable passion to do what she wishes. Although considered the weakest of the Konoha 9, Sakura has a knack for chakra control, and Inner Sakura seems to give her a bit of a teenage look about her. What girl doesn't have her own inner self that screams out what she wishes to say? Hatake Kakashi - the man that leads the group. A jounin beyond his years, Kakashi helps Sasuke most of the time, but in the end realizes his mistake of not helping out Naruto at all. This leads to him wanting to keep everyone safe, so it helps a lot of people. I personally adore Naruto. It gives me an insight of what I could be if I were an anime character. That character would be Sakura, no doubt. In the end, though, Naruto does have its kinks to work out, but it will surely become a masterpiece that I wish for my children to look back on.

"Naruto (also referred to as ""Ninja Brokeback Mountain"") is an anime about sand ninjas and eugenics. It is a gateway anime of the worst kind riddled with one-dimensional characters who lack development, poor pacing, numerous plot holes, shitty villains who ""aren't really so bad in the end"", an anime saturated in filler arcs, a final arc with a complicated mess of a plot that stretched on for a year, massive use abuse of plot armor to cover up shitty writing, and a story of ""friendship"" which somehow makes Boku No Pico look like Metal Gear Solid in comparison. Despite this, it is one of /a/'s guilty pleasures due to being a massive lolcow which has provided them with lulz for 15 years. The story is about a blonde-haired, afro hairstyled, blue-eyed, half-emo, foreigner half-demon ninja teen struggling to be accepted into society by being a whiny fagget who annoys everyone around him, including the viewers. His goal is to become Hokage Ninja Obama and change the world. To accomplish this he becomes a ninja who dresses in bright colors, doesn't into stealth, announces his presence to his enemies, literally only uses 2 jutsus for the entirety of the series, forgives mass murderers, and rather than killing enemies would rather give gay speeches about bonds and friendship and other shit. In fact, He is such a failure of a ninja that the plot replaced him with Sasuke ""Edge-Lord"" Uchiha as the main character halfway through the story due to Kishimoto's boner for his favorite character. One of the many themes in Naruto that are ultimately ignored is that hard work surpasses talent which is shown in how Naruto and Sasuke become the most overpowered characters by having perfect bloodlines and literally being handed power ups while characters like Rock Lee are ultimately forgotten by the plot. Great writing there, Kishimoto! Another lesson Naruto teaches is that if you stalk someone long enough, they will change their mind about you and will run back into your arms.

"Okay an honest review here truthfully this is one of my favorite anime, but there are things that i liked about the show and things that i hated about the anime. I enjoy the story, it starts of very simple but it gets deeper as you go on through the series, however it never explained why naruto dressed in orange. the art is amazing i love their style especially in the fighting scenes, i can see that they worked very hard on those scenes and i feel they did the anime some justice with they're art. The OST and the sound effects were awesome, it matched the Anime well, it made the fights more intense and also made a lot more scenes come to life. The Character all came in at the right time in the first season the main characters it focused on was Naruto, Saskue, Sakura, and Kakashi. Naruto was the most explained character, to be honest he was a terrible ninja in this series and should have died. Saskue is a very skilled ninja on the other hand and everyone likes him. Sakura, i can simply say i grew to hate her, as the story goes on she just makes everything worse. Kakashi is a mystery the whole time, you learn very little about him in this series. This anime is very enjoyable, but they are very repetitive with the flashbacks i don't mind flashbacks but if they keep repeating the same flashback that they showed a few episodes back it gets annoying, but the action keeps you in the show to be completely honest, the explanation of the abilities is also interesting some people hate it, but i like it, it's your opinion about that. also if you don't like filler after ep 135 go to 220 and skip the 1st half lol. overall i give it an 8/10 i personally think this show isn't overated its just people want others to see it.",8,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_376956031c,2,1735

I'd recommend Mars of Destruction before this. Naruto seemed to have potential at a first go, oh maybe it's going somewhere! Then it doesn't. So much for the plot. The art, is decent. Not really good enough to wow me. The sound was decent as well, but nothing worth talking about. The characters are awful, with no depth to them at all. If you are going to drop it for anything, it's going to be the shallow characters. Overall I didn't enjoy this. Nor should anyone watch this anime, ever.

"When people look at Naruto, they tend to look at it through the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia. And while that's fine, unfortunately, for someone who did not grow up with it, for someone whose major piece of media consumed was not Naruto, it mostly turns out to be just fine. The show starts off well - all the characters are shown to work towards a common goal, the goal of being a great shinobi. There are some pervy jokes thrown around here and there, but the story is mostly made to appeal to those who can relate to the childish aspect of the characters, the humour and the story. Many of the characters are likeable - Jiraiya and Kakashi are good mentors, Rock, Neji and Gaara are interesting characters, and Sasuke provides appeal in the form of a rival. The first arc is pretty good, though Naruto's declaration of becoming Hokage becomes really annoying and out of place real quick. The story of Zabuza and Haku, as well as their fight with Team 7, is pretty nice to watch. The Chunin Exam Arc, arguably, is the peak of the original Naruto anime : the arc is long, but each stage of the selection is fun to watch, as it provides compelling stories for each character involved, and the villain is interesting. Here is where the show starts cracking - fillers start to take over and backstories get repetitively shown. Naruto sitting on the swing with the sad music in the background became a meme for a reason after all. The Tsunade Arc is where this is seen a lot - many scenes are repeated constantly across the semi-long arc (and beware, these arcs get LONG). Many scenes are pretty imaginative, but, sadly, not all are interesting and add up to an uninspired child's imaginative stories. The same goes for the Sasuke Arc, which, while it had its moments with Itachi and the Uchiha Clan, was still pretty repetitive in its storytelling. Past that, everything till the end was filler, adding nothing to the story other than stretching it out for increased runtime and being almost unbearable. Characters like Sakura and Hinata were underused and poorly written, always relying on Naruto and Kakashi, among others, for help, but going back to acting rude to them or being absolutely detached. The art and animation was good, and while some of the fights were visually appealing, many early scenes were still shots. The music was treated much better, both in quality and usage. At the end of the day, Naruto is just a show made for children (put the pitchforks down fellas). Yes, some level of maturity is required to digest some of the plot points, but most of the show is made to appeal to predominantly younger audiences.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d904f4c708,2,2634
"I used to think that naruto was an ok show. But then I realized there is no point in watching an anime that will NEVER END! Even after 220 episodes they still refuse to end it. Instead they make a sequel!And naruto is also the most annoying main character ever. after the 500th &quot;believe it!&quot; the catch phrase tends to get annoying. one of the most annoying parts of the show are the flash backs.it gets really annoying when they show flash backs about the time that character stole a piece of bread or something right in the middle of an epic battle. another thing that isn't really annoying but is kinda weird is that this show has head sets, giant televisions, stoves, cameras, etc but no cars or guns. just a little odd. so unless you have a thing for anime that doesn't have an ending, and has annoying characters this probably isn't an anime for you.",1,Not Recommended,"Jan 8, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2f16f1cb27,2,865
"I believe that Naruto is in fact, if not the most, one of the most overrated and overestimated animes I have seen. First of all, most characters seem very generic, and the some chracters (ESPECIALLY female) lack usefulness. Before you tell me I'm wrong, think about this: If YOU were to be watching a fight where your comrades and close friends may be fighting for their lives and chance to save yours, would YOU be there at the sides shouting their names and probably just distracting them, or would you stand up and fight along? Of course, at some point these certain characters did change. But it would have been much better to make them at least a little more gutsy now, and have them progress later. Actually I would've rated their character even lower if it weren't for their development. Then, we have the endless supply of fillers. (And so I pray, Unlimited Naruto filler works.) These fillers are episodes which have no real relation to the plot and are created for the sole reason of making the episode longer. Honestly, I think having some fillers are good, because if all episodes were following a plot, the series would go very fast. The fact that they introduce us to new characters doesn't change anything except if that character has a relation to the plot. So, at first glance based on people saying how great this is, you may be thinking 'Ah, this is a pretty good series!' But you then start watching it, then you get bored of the fillers and sick of the useless characters that don't seem to die. Personally, I actually would have continued with the next season if it wasn't for the fear of having to go through a whole bunch of fillers again.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 16, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_37ffb0ba1a,2,1663
"Alright, so let me start off by saying, boy, was I a non-believer of Naruto! I remember watching it on YTV when I was like 12 or 13, and the only thing I remember was hating it. I even remember making fun of Narutards, but now, about 4-5 years later, am a Narutard myself. xD So I just want to say that if something's holding you back, ignore it and try it out! A good handful of episodes (20-30) should get you hooked on! After both Naruto and Naruto: Shippudden, I can confidently say that this is one of the best anime I've watched so far so I strongly recommend anyone to watch this series regardless of the genre you're interested in! So, let's get down to businessss: Sound: 10/10 Naruto had one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime (right behind Inuyasha that is!). I have felt all the emotions a human can possibly feel through the music itself. The fierce beating of the drums during the fights, soothing sound of the flute as Naruto reminisces about the past, upbeat instrumental as Pervy Sage sneaks a peek at the sexy ladies were a few of the many soundtracks that had me at the edge of my chair, crying, or at other times laughing 'till I fell off my chair! The sound in Naruto I found to be impeccable, and flawless, especially the OST. Art: 8/10 The art was good. Not amazing, I wouldn't say. But still pretty good. But if you're dissatisfied that there aren't that many hot guys ;) or girls, just wait 'till Shippudden! (Not to mention, another huge plus point is the yaoi/yuri fan-drawings you get to enjoy on DeviantArt or ZeroChan! ;) hehehe) But aside from the character drawings (which is still great!), the scenery were outstanding! My favourite colour is green, so I found the lush forests, and the soft paddy fields to be just absolutely breath-taking! The scenery really makes you want to live life in the edo period because it gives off the feeling that life is so relaxing! Story: 7.5/10 The story has a lot of potential (as you will see in Naruto: Shippudden), but unfortunately, there are a little too many filler episodes! But don't be discouraged because once you get addicted, you wouldn't care about the filler because the original plot is just too exciting! Besides, you can always skip the filler (search Google!). When you think it can't get any better, Naruto: Shippudden just surprises you with the improved pace! So, like I said, don't be discouraged if you think the pacing in Naruto is too slow and the plot isn't progressing, because in the next sequel, it really picks up! But apart from the warnings and ""bad things"", Naruto is a lot about friendship, and how they live life and fight against evil all while they stand beside their comrades. One thing for sure in Naruto, you know they've got each others' backs. Pardon the cheesyness but that's the main reason I like it so much! :3 Character: 9/10 The characters are really easy to love! And it's just amazing when they fight together to fight evilll. (haha, there it is again, the cheesyness within me). It's so easy to laugh along with, fall in love with (sasori x deidara ;)), and just admire these characters! Enjoyment: 9/10 I never thought after completing Avatar the Last Airbender that I'd fall in love with a show again, but here it is, Naruto! I really enjoyed it! Throughout the whole time I was experiencing so many emotions - anger, happiness, fear, jealousy (Sasori! ;)), and depression. Naruto's up there on my list ;) (though Shippudden's higher ;D) Overall: 8.5/10 Overall, it was a really enjoyable show and I'd recommend it to anyone especially if you'd like a series where you can get attached to the characters (a longer one rather than the short 12 or 26 episodic animes). Hope you enjoy it as much as I do and send me a message if you decide to try it out and how it goes with you! ;) For now, I shall bid you adieu and get on to One Piece (hehe, my new addiction...) -uhh, call me Blaze.

"As a big anime fan, i watched many different animes, maybe not as much as most people, but still enough to find what i liked and disliked, and Naruto is definately not in those choces of in between, it,s plain flat hatred, at first i was obsessed with the anime, and now i do NOT understand why... seriousely... it,s really disapointing, Naruto is the most viewed and probably the most loved shounen manga/animes ever.... i seriousely don't get why people are so hooked on it, it's clichéd and overused Story: 1 A kid who's parents died (right there, cliché) when she was a baby (cliché) has the dream to become the leader of his village (cliché) and has a crush on a girl (cloché) who hates him and likes another guy (cliché) who is way cooler (cliché), those three end up in the same team (cliché) with a teacher who wants to unite them better (cliché).... That's the basic story, alot of things happen obviousely, but i just can't find anything that really ATTRACTS me to the story well.. and i,m a huge fan of shounen, many of my friends don,t even believe i'm a girl because of that, so i have a pretty good eye to compare, and when i compare between this anime and another shorter/better story, i would definately pick another anime... the story is too long and too boring after a while, many of my friends stopped reading/watching it because it took too long, they simply don't care about the end anymore. Art: 8 Art was pretty good, that was one thing i didn't hate about the anime, it's pretty basic and simple to draw, and it's also easier to imitate drawing characters like those, but i can't give the art a 10, because it was too simple, sure most people will tell me what the hell i'm talking about since art isn't what matters most, i know that, but i'm trying to look for reasons to not give this anime a 0, catch my drift? Sound: 4 The sound was okay, but it was always the same tone... i just wished they had different sounds, and the allmighty overused HA noise... well it's in one song, but it apears everywhere... Character: 1 the characters were UTTLERLY clichéd... hyper main character, cool second main character, lovesick mmain girl.... you see those almost everywhere.... Enjoyement: 1 (sadly there is no 0..) Plain flat boring, plain flat clichéd, plain flat annoying and most of all, plain flat TOO F*CKING LONG i can't believe people are ACCTUALLY still into that anime! like seriousely?

"Overview: Naruto has been going strong for 15 years now and is one of the most popular anime in the world. What exactly does this series do so well to gain such a massive fandom? Let's jump through some poorly animated trees and into a world where stealth assassins wear bright orange jump suits! This is Naruto! Story: 6/10 Naruto takes place in a world where ninjas are extremely common and perform many tasks: messengers, body guards, assassins, scientists, and even national leaders. The ninjas in this show don't actually conform to the stereotypes portrayed in cinema. In fact, they are often so far removed from everything associated with ninja that they may as well just be called mutants or super heroes. What the hell does telepathically controlling sand have to do with being a ninja? I played Tenchu on the PS1 and I sure as hell wasn't killing people with fucking sand! Anyways, the plot follows the hyperactive, rambunctious, yet highly ambitious Naruto Uzumaki and his goal to become leader of his ninja village. Naruto has lived as an outcast his entire life because he has a demonic 9 tailed fox sealed inside him by his father. His father did this in order to stop the rampaging 9 tails from destroying the village and it ended up costing him his life. Naruto must use his powers to slowly win the trust and respect of his village and his fellow ninja team mates. The beginning of the series features a lot of training and tedious explanation of ""chakra"" and other concepts of the Naruto world. The story actually starts getting interesting when Naruto must take a special test called the Chuunin exam in order to gain a higher rank and go on more dangerous missions. I won't attempt to explain 15 years of plot in this small review, but trust me that the plot goes on FAR longer than necessary. Kishimoto keeps creating new enemies in order to drag it on longer and longer. Just when the latest big bad is defeated, we get to hear a sob story and learn that big bad #120 was actually being controlled by big bad #121, who it will turn out is merely a puppet in the schemes of #122. The plot is also bogged down by god awful filler that ranks among the worst shonen filler EVER! Ok, well not as bad as Inuyasha's filler, but still bad. Character: 6/10 Naruto has a LOT of characters, some of whom are interesting and fun to watch and some of whom are an absolute pain in the ass. Unfortunately, Naruto is one of least interesting characters in the whole series. He redefines what it means to be a generic shonen hero cliche'. Sasuke spends the vast majority of the series being a whiny little twat that you just want to bitch slap. Sakura's affection for Sasuke seems extremely misplaced and she doesn't do anything useful until Shippuden starts...after episode 220. Hinata is actually one of the interesting characters. Like Shinji from Evangelion, she is the socially awkward, overwhelmed, nervous wreck that the otaku at home will probably most identify with. I'm certainly a LOT more Hinata than I am Naruto and I am willing to wager that so is nearly everyone else. Her struggles aren't so much about taking down impossibly strong villains, but learning how to express her feelings and get over her introversion and social anxiety. The real world nature of these problems make them infinitely more identifiable for the viewer. One of my other favorites is Gaara, who starts out as a lonely yet psychopathic ninja that brutally murders everyone that crosses his path. However, the show actually tries to make him sympathetic and largely succeeds. We get to see him slowly redeem himself and even become his country's leader. Apparently if you are strong in this world, your countless murders of innocent people are simply waved away and you can get selected to lead a nation. Hell yeah! Lucy/Gaara 2016! My other favorite characters include the absolute badass Itachi and pretentious artist Deidara. Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack features many memorable openings and closings along with kickass instrumentals to pump up the fight scenes. Naruto also has just the right music to make tragic scenes moving and happy scenes more fun. It isn't the perfect anime soundtrack, but it is solid throughout. Art: 6/10 The art isn't the greatest ever, but it isn't bad. You also have to consider the budgetary constraints of having a 500+ episode series when you groan at the use of poorly animated 3 second loops of characters jumping through trees. God damn Sasuke retrieval arc! Enjoyment: 3/10 In Heart of Darkness we are left with the famous last utterance of Kurtz, ""the horror, the horror!"" In Naruto this would be ""The filler...the filler!"" Seriously, the awful filler content along with the tedious explanations whenever anyone uses any technique, make this series often painful to watch. I recommend the far superior manga. Overall: 6/10 Naruto has some things that it admittedly does quite well, along with a substantial list of flaws. I would ultimately say that it is a very average series. It is a good introduction to anime for the uninitiated, but there are honestly far better anime out there. There is also far, far worse. I'm not going to be the anime snob that tells young teens that Naruto is the single worst anime ever created. That would be a complete lie. I've sat through Ikki Tousen, Najika Blitz Tactics and Seikon no Qwasar, so I know what I'm fucking talking about.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 27, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_723f4f0ee1,2,5403
"NARUTARDS BEWARE Let me start off by saying that I, like many others, watch this show immediately after very popular anime like Dragon ball z, Yu Yu Hakusho, Trigun, so I thought that this show was great, though some things always stuck out in my mind. That being said, let me move on to this, Naruto TANKED, FAILED, SUCKED, WOMPED, AND ALL AROUND NOT GOOD after the Rock Lee vs Garra fight, (around ep 50 ish)although looking back it was not that great before that. Story: Very mediocre, &quot;I want to be the ______ strongest and best ________ so that everyone will ________!!!!!!!!!!&quot; Seen it all before, he wants people to notice him because he didn't have any friends and has a demon fox inside of him that he conveniently didn't began to use until the beginning of the series. Now I would like to digress to a few things that I notice, First Naruto claims that nobody talked/acknowledged him but then he is shown eating with Choji, sleeping with kiba, and running from the hokage? with Shikamaru when they were all younger, now I no expert but that sounds like friends to me. Second is on the first episode, a YOUNG, UNTRAINED NINJA WANNABE and a mediocre older ninja managed to steal a highly &quot;important&quot; scroll that teaches someone something that alot of people already know (shadow clone). anyway, the story suck because usually when someone says they are going to do something (especially when it's so close to there reach) they do it, Naruto it no closer to become Hokage than he was 200+ episodes ago. LOL I don't even need to talk about the fillers since its been killed and rekilled. Art: Everyone says its so great but has anyone else noticed that in at least 2 fights (team 7 vs girl Orochimaru and Sasuke vs Naruto) the animation changed drastically in the middle of the fight...........'nuf said. Sound: No real complaints other than, that music gets annoying after a while, I mean the HUH one, and some of the VA's are annoying. Character: Oh yes, now first SOME OF THE CHARACTERS DON'T HAVE PASTS!!!!!!!!!! yea I suppose people like Shino and Ten Ten had absolutely nothing of importance happen to them, and while on the subject of Ten Ten, the author of Naruto HIMSELF said the Ten Ten iss just a FILLER character, acting only to fill in the place of the female character in Guys team..........what type of crap is the a filler main character, also there are no character (outside of filler) interactions, I'd like to see Lee and Hinata have a conversation, I'd like to see Kiba and Neji chat it up. Naruto is just plan annoying his attitude changes to much, one minute he's destroying the villages monument and the next he's risking his life for one dude, and what's up with this I will get Sasuke back no matter what it so annoying, has he given up on being Hokage? The saving graces of the characters are Kakashi, Shikamaru, and a few others that they almost never show. One more thing the characters almost never change, Kiba has been the same( from what they've shown) since the beginning so has Sasuke, Sakura, Lee, ALL FEMALE CHARACTERS etc, etc Enjoyment: like I said, at first I enjoyed it, then it just starting getting.........Awful. Overall: A good started anime, but for people who have seen things other than Digimon, Pokemon, Dbz, anything on Adult swim, and Sailor moon, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS!!!!!!!!!!",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_38c952fbbf,2,3357
"Style - It's ok. Some parts (e.g Lee vs Gaara fight) are decent, other parts are not so great. 2 out of 3. Character - The main flaw with Naruto characters is that they are clinically retarded. Ninjas are supposed to be stealthy, right? There wasn't a single stealthy ninja in the whole of naruto. Naruto wears a orange jumpsuit, Sakura wears red, Sasuke wears blue, the Akatsuki wear black cloaks with red clouds and everyone wears a shiny light-reflecting ""forehead protector"". Sure is stealthy. You see, normal people tend to avoid fighting for no good reason as it means getting hurt, noticed, and arrested. Naruto characters on the other hand start fights for no reason at all other than to bolster their incredibly fragile egos. Naruto is an impulsive idiot. Sasuke is an arrogant asshole. Sakura is useless. In addition, all of the characters are immature, naive, and lazy. Oh yeah, did I mention the fact that Naruto charges headlong into every fight, breaking formation and getting his ass kicked, every single time? He must have brain damage from getting beaten up so often. 0 out of 4. Story - The story of Naruto is complete nonsense. Throwing knives are crap as ranged weapons. It'd be easier to just sneak up on someone and stab them with it. Why does nobody use a bow and arrow in Naruto? They already have computer screens. The original Eastern concept of chakra was taken by Naruto and made into magic points that allow you to break the laws of physics. Naruto originally wanted to be a hokage. Now he's more interested in retrieving Sasuke. Okay let's go through the plot. First there was the Zabuza mission, where I thought they should have died. Zabuza alone could have taken all of them out but he wasted too much time chatting around. Then there's Haku, who was about to kill both Naruto and Sasuke when suddenly Naruto's 9-tailed fox guardian came out of nowhere and saved the day. This then happens every single time Naruto is in trouble - the 9 tailed fox saves the day. It gets repetitive and sends all the wrong messages to the kids (no hard work needed, just call the 9 tailed fox!!). Also, how Naruto defeated Kiba in the preliminary exam was just incredibly stupid, needless to say shitting your pants wouldn't save you from someone determined to beat the shit out of you in real life. Oh yeah and Naruto gives speeches that instantly turns villains into good guys. 0 out of 3. Overall 2 out of 10 for retarded characters and nonsensical plot.",2,Not Recommended,"Apr 21, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_83160511cc,2,2473
"This review is from my personal assessment of episodes 1 to 135, inclusive, of the Naruto series. I will try to do something interesting in this review, and that is to review the anime at the time it was aired and touch on its impact on me at the time it was aired. If there were ever a series that had vastly extreme views, it would have to be this one. And thus, this is why I had to review it, to contribute my thoughts into this sensitive subject. What is Naruto? It is an action series that appeared out of nowhere that, in my opinion, along with Bleach, defined the action/adventure/drama genre. By saying that a series defined a genre, it does not mean that series is the best from that genre. It merely means that the series, at that time, came out and boosted the enjoyment and popularity of that genre, also becoming one of the most popular of that genre. That series will be compared to when people talk of the genre, and newer series of the same genre will aim to surpass it. That is, by my definition, what is means to define a genre. Story: 7/10 From the moment it came out I was hooked. The story was catchy, and the action was already present in the first episode. What really impressed me was the second episode, which introduced a very common sub-genre into the action genre, and that is comedy. The pacing of the series was good, the suspense was there, the comedy was there, and there was this yearning to find out more about all the other ninjutsu and fighting styles that were also there. The plot, in itself, was pretty bad and didn't make a lot of sense to me. Basically, each ninja is supposed to find &quot;their way of being a ninja&quot; and by doing so, many of them broke the rules for being a ninja. By being a ninja, one has to put their mission above all of their emotions, but the series is completely based on themes of loneliness, sadness, friendship, and all this stuff that's about emotions. However, this was what I analyzed after looking back at the series. Back then, the plot was good enough for me to keep my interest in it; therefore, I gave it an overall seven. Art: 8/10 The action scenes are quite cool back then since it was really some of the most impressive action sequences that I have ever seen. The art, not animation, was just mediocre. Nothing really stands out, and while the ninjas &quot;teleporting&quot; from place to place looks cool, it is really just easier to animate. I will argue that the lack of artistic involvement does not affect my enjoyment of the series significant, and from a director's point of view, a long series such as this cannot afford to spent much more time on art. Sound: 10/10 The background music was what blew me away. Sometimes it is soothing and sad, other times it is cheery, and during action scenes, it is catchy and fun. Without Naruto's famous background music scores, the quality of the series would really go down drastically, since hearing is one of the senses that is necessary to draw someone completely into a series. Naruto did just that, so I will give Toshiro Masuda, the composer for the Naruto scores, my highest regards. Character: 7/10 Looking at each character at a time, they all have great development. Of course, everyone's favorite is Haku, and it is for a very good reason. I still think that Haku's &quot;arc&quot; is the best arc of Naruto, simply because of the huge amount of emotions that the arc conveys. Naruto, Sasuke, and Gaara all have their own sad pasts, and it is common for the characters' actions to be driven by events that happened to them in the past. This, in a sense, unifies the plot and shows mastery of character development. After all, the past, present, and future plays a huge role of &quot;their way of ninja.&quot; There is one flaw when you look at the overall picture, however. All of the main characters seem to suffer from the same sad and bitter past, which gets repetitive after a while. Enjoyment: 10/10 After all of this criticism, I just plainly and inexplicably enjoyed the series. Naruto is one series where equations don't work out and analyses fail. I can find so many flaws about it, but yet, it is just so damn enjoyable. There were many memorable scenes, such as Haku's loyalty and Sakura's feelings. Anime can be watched, enjoyed, and tossed away, but the ones that create vivid memories are the ones that you enjoy the most. Overall: 7/10 Remember that I am only reviewing this anime up to episode 135, so fillers are not included. I personally think that the fillers ruined the anime, and they were such a drastic failure that we forgot about the time when Naruto was enjoyable. Yes, I think that Naruto is just a mediocre series now and not as good as it used to be. However, I will never forget the amount of enjoyment this series have given me, and I will give it a fair rating on how much it meant to me. Naruto was part of my early anime experience, and it was one of the reasons why I am such an anime fan today. I owe a lot to this series, and even though it might not be great now, it is a series I will always remember.",7,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f0c1c56f28,2,5088
"Okay. Well, at first, I saw my brother watching this series. At first I was like &quot;what is this series?&quot; Then I heard about this Naruto thing. So I decided to check it. I read the biograpy and was amazed of the plot. I'm not really a fan of action. But this series is not only about fighting. You will not like Naruto if you don't know the real story of it. Some of my classmates are saying that &quot;Naruto sucks!&quot; And I'm just saying that &quot;You just don't know the story. That's why you hate it.&quot; Each of the characters has their own talents, dreams, and sad pasts. Especially Naruto, Gaara, and Sasuke. Sometimes I'm annoyed that there are tons of characters in the story. I gave all 10 because the story is great, especially the art. All of the characters has unique looks. Character, all of them has a story and has their own dreams, it made me inspired. Enjoyment, sometimes my mother would ask me if I'm crazy or something. I mean, laughing, talking, and crying in front of the computer? xD Overall, 10 Outsanding. =) This is the very first Japanese dubbed anime I've ever watched.

"Many first-timers love this anime and some experienced anime fans give this anime a poor score. However, this anime appeals to a wide range of teenagers for its classic shounen and comedy with slight romance. ______________________________________________________________ Story: 9/10 The only reason the story is only 9 is because of the stupid fillers from 140-220. If those weren't there this would definitely receive a 10. They aren't bad but sometimes it seems repetitive and you just want the story to move on. The story starts out with Naruto causing mischief again, but as the story progresses he becomes a little more mature. My favorite part of the story is how Naruto has to prove to society that he is capable of being hogake, the best ninja in the village. ______________________________________________________________ Art: 10/10 The art is great. The ninja moves they are all very detailed and has a good design. The character design is also very balanced. ______________________________________________________________ Sound: 10/10 The background music(bgm) is just amazing. I mean seriously, they fit perfectly with the atmosphere and enhance the scene. The opening songs are great and my favorite one is the last one, ""Yura Yura"" by Hearts Grow. Its been almost a year since I first heard that song and I am still addicted to it. The ending songs are also good because of the slow emotional feeling. ______________________________________________________________ Character: 10/10 It may not seem like a 10 in the beginning, but trust me after a while the characters get to be one of its best aspects. The three main characters all have different personalities and they change as the story goes. The supporting characters are great because they're not just forgotten about and actually play a part in the story. ______________________________________________________________ Enjoyment: 9/10 It is a great anime for fans of martial arts and hand-to-hand combat. The reason that I enjoyed it was because the way Naruto never gives up was just inspiring to me. ______________________________________________________________ Overall: 9/10 This will always be one of the best anime I have ever watched, and I highly recommend you to try it.

"This is one of the most over rated animes ever, i may say that this review is abit biased seeing as ive watched only 2 episodes in a row, but through friends ive watched well over 30 of tid bits of episodes. But i remain uncertain of why this anime is so good. To me its only a good &quot;cartoon&quot; not anime. For only non full anime fans watch this who don't know what a good anime REALY is. and comparing this to other animes its TERRIBLE. Nothing good can be said about naruto in my eyes. The japanes voices are so kiddy and terrible acting and little good for the bubs. The story jsut DRAGS N' DRAGS. Although the characters i can say some what of good about there &quot;coolitude&quot; and the art is rather good. It's bright and creative and creates a somewhat decent atompshere in each scenerio. But this is not a good anime and i dont recomend watching it. if i was to recomend a good starter anime, I WOULD NVER SAY NARUTO. I would recomend either Gintama or Bleach. They both have a fantastic comeical side and serious fighting side. if u dont watch niether of them still avoid THIS RUBBISH and instead watch Inuyasha OR on a logn shot Yu-gi-oh x",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 27, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9d9675cb43,2,1160
"I have not done a review in awhile and the reason for doing a review on such a popular anime is that I've checked a lot of random peoples profile to get anime inspiration as well as to compare and only about 40% had seen Naruto!!! This is not including those that dropped it or put it on hold etc. but how does one not attempt to watch it?! Obv. it is not for all people but here's my review anyway. Story- It's your classic underdog story that a lot of people can relate with. Let's face it, people in America can be very cruel to others that openly express their love for anything unorthodox. This is a anime full of struggle and perseverance, the message is so clear and motivating it's just as motivating after watching one of the Rocky movies (If for some reason you don't like Rocky make another analogy for something that pumps you up and it's equivalent to Naruto). The comedy is pretty good and they do not repeat the same jokes so that is a blessing. Why wasn't this a 10? Well I will tell you that the huge problem with this and its sequel is the damn FILLER! The filler is pretty awful not gonna lie. Trust me when I say do not quit the show because of it; worst comes to worst google where the filler ends and start from that ep. and skip all the filler; it's more enjoyable that way. Art- The art is good, not great. The fights, characters, justu and all the other effects look cool but in the original Naruto it's much less crisp. The colors are not as powerful as they could be and maybe it gives it a cool vintage feel but this is all about preference. Sound- This deserves a freakin 10! The soundtrack is easily something you can download to your i-pod it's so catchy. Every opening is great. I do not know why but I really do not listen to a lot of enjoyable ending songs, honestly I can think out of all the anime I have seen I only enjoy 4 ending songs. This show doesn't have great endings. That is not why I did not rate it a 10; it is because of the Dub. I have seen this show with both languages and lemme tell ya, the Dub gets very obnoxious. Sub is the way to go. Character- This show has more development than a teenager. Important people can die remember that it is not all sunshine and rainbows. The heroes you will love and the villains are beyond dark and evil and you will love to hate them. Enough said... Overall a nostalgic, easily rewatchable funny action packed anime. If you haven't seen it please do yourself a favor and watch it. Skip the filler and enjoy the fun ride Naruto will take you on.

The whole show is great especially for kids ranged 10+ up and it sets out the whole &quot;never give up on your dreams&quot; attitude there are some humor around it sometimes, but it still forced striaght to the main part of the story. Whatever you liked reading it, watch the anime version from Viz or in it's original dub it's still a good show to watch. Although I quite suggest not to watch the filter arc when toonami shows them.

"First off: The fillers are definately not worth watching ( probably the only exception is ep101 or 105, can't remember which, where Naruto and crew tried to get Kakashi to reveal what's under his mask). They are just random episodes made out of the blue, and contain no storyline whatsoever ( unlike the Bount Arc). Story up to the end of ...: This part of Naruto got me glued to my monitor. The plot rapidly unfolds in this arc, and new characters rapidly intoduced. Lots of wonderful fighting scenes, with little or no character. Very good. After the aforementioned arc to beginning of filler season: here characters are explored to more detail, also the plot is made more complex. Some good action scenes here, of course the best one being the fight between X and X. However, after this point, the plot deteriorates, it became dull and generic.Humours are used in an attempt to maintain audience attention, but became predictable as the story goes.

"Characters/Development Although the beginning of the story may not give much of an impression and suggest the characters are going to be having childish adventures together. The series is actually much different than expected which does get interesting the further the story develops. Of course to be expected there are many fight sequences adding a lot of action to the series, but more on that later. Throughout Naruto there are many different story arcs which usually link together explaining the plot more in depth filling some holes, teaching us pieces of the past or developing certain characters more. The series however does tend to drag on a lot for each episode or fight sequences which may take a while to conclude. Many flashbacks are also included which take two different approaches. One that develop the character or explain an event either briefly or in depth. One that are to remind the audience of previous episodes, sometimes even during the early moments of an episode. The latter tend to get boring and eventually rather annoying. Added into the mix of things are a few emotional moments for characters and some comedy which might give a chuckle but nothing too hilarious except one or two events. The characters in this series are rather unique in several ways. They each have their very own skills, ambitions and views upon certain matters. Most of the characters are focused on the younger generation, while there are still plenty of the older generation to experience, creating a large collection of likable or dislikeable characters. To pick a few, we have Naruto who appears to be quite dumb in understanding things, but has a good heart and knows how to get out of sticky situations during combat. His views can be quite mature for his age and the audience may sympathise with him at times. Then we have Sasuke who is the quiet vengeful type, of whom is seeking to kill his brother and the revival of his clan. Although having a dark atmosphere around him he can worry about his team and even become jealous of Naruto. We than have Sakura who appears to be a sweet girl, having her heart set on Sasuke, yet she can get in some bad tempers and show her other personality. Finally you have Kakashi, the team leader of the three, of adult age, who can be quite a likable character. He loves reading romance themed books of a certain series and is constantly later when meeting up with the team. Throughout the series, the skills and ways of each character is reflected in one way or another so we can learn the way they are like on the battlefield or within a group. The combat is a little different than expected at a slower pace and being tactical rather than having much physical contact. Lots of thrown weapons are used, or types of hand seals, which can either, improve an aspect of themselves or use as a form of attack in battle. Most fights can get quite violent with some bloody scenes here and there. Problems with these fight sequences most noticable are the fact the characters involved talk too much. It can be interesting to learn how they pulled of a certain strategy, or what their attacks actually do to their opponents or surroundings. Another problem are the flashbacks, which doesn&rsquo;t make sense when characters are facing against an enemy. Yet another problem is the constant usage of the same move from time to time which did get rather boring as well. Most fights during the series are conflicts that take place during the storyline while others tend to show the characters skills off a little, such as the Chuunin exam, which they take to become middle rank ninja. The series may take its story arcs at a slow pace but it eventually concludes the first main part of the story in 135 episodes, while the rest are filler episodes, which can be watched optionally as, they don&rsquo;t develop the story any further. I never did watch them. Animation/Scenery Art and animation improve over time and also seem to be done differently at certain points in the series. Firstly the animation starts off quite dull in the beginning episodes but quickly picks up from there. Most simple actions are done in a simple manner, but most noticeable difference are during the fight sequences, which can take two different approaches towards them which I&rsquo;ll explain a little later. There are quite a lot of still shots throughout either type of scene to possibly lengthen the episodes on helping to drag the series on a little longer. There are a few moments where the animation can get awkward from time to time. Effects for the techniques and powers seem to have been done fairly well too. The two types of combat animation is best explained by using the words, slow and fast which now should be fairly obvious. During the slow combat situations, they contain a lot of talking and quick attacks or moves here and there being rather paced and tactical while the level of detail in each scene is still there. It is quite the opposite for the faster paced combat, more directed towards the physicals sides of fighting through punching and kicking. The scenes are much more quicker paced yet the level of detail is lower than normal for both the scenes and characters, yet more interactiveness to the environment around them. Character designs overall can have a similar look to each other resorting to uses of different facial or clothing accessories. However, they are quite unique and fairly recognisable between them, while remaining well drawn. The best noticeable ways of making some characters stand out are these examples; The head guard covering Kakashi&rsquo;s left eye, Lee&rsquo;s large eyes and fuzzy eyebrows, while being nicknamed by Naruto for having so and Shiino&rsquo;s sunglasses, with the top of his coat masking most of his face. Most of the lesser characters such as guards have a rather simple look between them. This also helps these characters stand out quite well from the rest making them interesting, especially once you learn more about them in the series. Art wise, the series uses a lot of soft, bright tones for the characters and objects while being slightly saturated looking for the scenery. During the first few episodes the art seemed quite dull, but again quickly improves like everything else, getting sharper and visually more appealing. The scenery is also made quite well using consistent blends of colour and schemes. The village of Konoha uses a lot of brighter colours such as reds and greens to detail the locations. While for the hidden village of sand uses many yellows and yellowish looking cream colours. The makes the locations also unique in appearance just like the characters. Fights take place in different types of locations instead of barren landscapes, and vary between them during the series such as woodlands, bridges and canopy of trees to name a few depending on the situation. Audio/Music There are quite a lot of sound effects and music that create a nice set and compile together pretty well during either of the scenes where used. The contact of thrown weapons on wood, flesh or material is used correctly as well as the other sounds being timed right, no major complaints in this area. These sounds eventually become much more common and easy to recognise after a several episodes or less. Music is a nice highlight to the series, quite unique in tune mixing a bit of modern or rock with old style or chants. Each track has its one touch, being used well throughout the series during the correct scenes. These also become common and quite enjoyable where I&rsquo;ve found myself tapping my feet to them as they start up. New tracks are introduced as the series progresses and some can make certain scenes much more exciting to watch, emotional of funnier depending on the scene again. Never had a problem with the voice actors, but found the mysterious or evil characters fit their role, being reflected towards the audience well. Conclusion An interesting series that isn&rsquo;t for everyone out there, which can be either liked or hated. Many characters and action sequences which are usually approached well although the series does tend ot drag on, while being combined with good sound and music throughout. Enjoyable watch putting the slow pace aside, yet an over rated series.",7,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2007",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c595c89cc6,3,8291

Well the more experienced anime viewers are going to give reviews of probly 5 and lower while the beginers are going to say it was outstanding and naruto is just one of those animes where you hate it or love it. Naruto is a big anime for kids and alot of anime biginers watch this anime because its so huge in the anime world that they think why not? so i am going to give this review all ive got. ~Story~ Well what can you say The plot is accually pretty fair and original on the basis of ninjas hokage ect. but i think it dragged on far too long with hundreds of episodes and its still not over its alot like one piece and bleach in that it just wont seem to end the start of naruto is great untill you get about half through the original series and it just gets boring and pointless and then with shippuden it goes good and then bad again but we will stick to the original naruto. I found that the series is alot of fillers and no real plot line other than alot of ahem sakura screaming sasuke but thats not really the point lol. ~Characters~ One word: Dull.....The characters grow sure but they dont really seem to well its hard to explain ill say it an easier way. The characters are idiots because all they focase on is find sasuke oh he killed aton of people oh well lets find him anyway its like a huge game of tag in this anime they chase sasuke he chases them over and over again its dull and boring. ~Overall~ To new people to anime watch this but to experienced people in the anime community dont bother you wont be missing much other than alot of screaming. =\ 5/10,5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 14, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1fcbab4ff4,3,1578
"Story- Well if you haven't already seen at least an episode or two of this show online,on tv,or you live in a box then let me give you a little bit of the main story to this great anime. In the beggining the show starts of with a sort of flashback of the ninja leaf village. You see that there is a terrible demon that is attacking the village. The narrator will go on to tell you that the hokage of the village sealed the spirit of the fox demon in a little boy, and this boy is Naruto. After that it will start in the modern time of the story. Naruto will go on to make many friends in the ninja academy and go on many adventure through out this anime as this show is a 220 episode series with many story arcs. From episode 135 to 220 though there are filler episodes(episodes that are not original to the manga) created because the author could not start on working on the next story of this show because the anime episodes were catching up to the releases of the manga. Anyway you will notice as the story goes on the development of the characters and their maturity. Characters- Naruto- He's a imature at the beggining but becomes more serious when his friends or comrades are in danger. Sasuke- His style is to be considered as emo due to him being in an almost always depressed laid back sort of mood. (Will you learn more about later in the series about his family etc.) Sakura- She's kind of annoying to most people that watch this show because of her weakness in the beggining of the show and her complaining and competiveness to win Sasukes heart. Kakashi- A very quiet teacher to the squad but you will learn more about his background in the series. He's very strong and protective though. Animation Quality- The animation quality of this show is not very high mainly for the reason being that this is quite a long show and was aired weekly. Pros- This anime has a very addictive story line and characters as well as good morals at times. The fighting is pretty good and is overall a very entertaining anime. It also has some funny humor at times. Cons- This anime does not have the best animation quality and the story line is a little predictable at times. But you do have to remember that this is an anime more for a younger audience.",9,Recommended,"May 18, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_aecedbe030,3,2249
well naruto is a very interesting anime its about a young idiotic persevering little boy. he causes a lot of trouble and he wants to become the greatest hokage. naruto has the 9 tailed fox spirit in him that almost destroyed the hidden leaf village. naruto likes to succede but he is still too weak. naruto's catch phrase is BELIEVE IT!!! he says that when anyone does not believe in him. naruto is truly an amazing anime. the reason i like naruto is because it was my first anime. naruto gave me the courage to try new animes. so i would give this anime 5 stars.,10,Recommended,"Jun 21, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_5d0cecc3e5,3,563
"This anime....well it is something else. I enjoyed watching every episode. The music was so upbeat and keeps an audience hooked. Every episode, I was either on the edge of my seat in suspense, or I was on the floor laughing. This anime incoorporates humor and all seriousness in one. This is definaltly an anime that I will remember forever. The characters are very different and the viewers can find a way to relate to at least one of them. (Sasuke and I for example.) The plot is very well thought out. The only thing that I hated about this anime was the fillers. They didn't need to add them. It ruined the plot. And it was going so well... I seriously recommend this for anyone who is into suspense, action, doesn't mind a little blood, drama, romance (a little..) and comedy.

"Premise: Fictional feudal-style Japan, where the Ninjas roam wearing cool SWAT costumes. Besides that, they also have Dragon Ball style ""chi"". Character: There's only 3 characters you need to know: Naruto - The main character (hence the anime title) who is a mediocre ninja if not for the hidden demon inside him. Sakura - A useless girl who serves no purpose in this anime, a liability who always got in the way of other people. Sasuke - An emo boy who thinks he's the center of the world. Relationships: Naruto has a crush on Sakura because he thinks she's cute, even though she's a b*tch to him. Sakura is obsessed on Sasuke because she likes the typical bad boy type. Sasuke thinks Naruto is his rival and get pissed when Naruto is stronger than him. But actually Sasuke is just confused by his love for Naruto. Plot: Fight, fight, fight, training.

Overall storyline itself is fantabulous. Character developement is also awesome. To be honest, one of the characters has helped me understand myself littel better now. Some of the themes (Orochimaru's theme, etc) are awesome and the art is good too. Since it is shounen, so you also have lot of action, which is top notch as well. The only disappointing aspects of the series might be its' speed at which it covers the manga and the fillers.

First those who haven't seen should be aware of is that this anime has a LARGE amount of filler and by LARGE amount I mean a LARGE amount. It felt like the author stopped caring half way through.The story starts off awesome, however becomes very very weak the only reason I'm giving it a 5 is for the action and a few touching moments.

"the modern day prototypical shonen anime, it exemplifies what shonen is all about with a young hero and his friends, including lots of action and humor. I really enjoyed watching this, I gave it an 8 for story when it actually was sticking to the main story line, I didn't count the filler episodes, which i admit make up pretty much the second half of the entire series, but even the fillers brought some good chuckles for me, and a couple of action gems. The art was pretty good, and I'll say that look forward to a very important fight, where the animation takes two steps up. The sound or music I assume was pretty good, and the OP and ED of the anime were fun to listen to, especially Haruka Kanata (OP2). The characters are awesome, some of my favorites are in this anime, although some may dislike Sakura...

"Naruto! Oh wow! This is the BEST anime I had ever seen! I ranked it #1 on my anime list actually. Naruto is very inspirational, full of good values and adventures that wil take each one of us in very thrilling fantasy. Because of this anime I became more and more like Naruto, friendly, brave and strong! I adore every statement of the characters, even if he/she is bad or good. This anime shows not only fantasy but also reality. It reveals every characters' sorrows and happy moments. I believe that this anime is NOT boring, you will eventually get closer to the true personality of each characters, you could feel hatred or be amaze of that certain character. Story: THE BEST. I rated it as an outstanding one. Every episodes lead to another closer look to the character. I know it got lot of fillers, but it doesn't really matter!! What matter is to understand the importance of the story not what you are seeing wrong on the series. Art: THE BEST.I rated it again as the best because of the well-made fighting scenes although there are a lot of troubles in the fighting sequences. Sound: THE BEST. I really like the sound, the BGM and most especially the OP and ED songs! The BGM suits every scenes and every character, from the happiest to the saddest music. Character: THE BEST. Very well molded characters. Each revealing unique attitudes and emotions. Naruto series really shows that each one of us iare UNIQUE. Enjoyment: I really enjoy this anime! It makes me happy all day!

"**Has Been Re-Edited, Watched as of Episode 62** Story - 5.6/10 (F+) What story? Oh the Ninja boy wants to be the best. Where have i heard this from before? Like countless other shounen shows. But only Naruto has the balls to actually bore us with pointless slapstick comedy and 3-4 episode long fights that hardly resolve anything except more questions. Naruto is like a trainwreck, it's so bad yet you still watch it to laugh at it. Animation - 5.0/10 (F) Aside from the whole &quot;Sexy Ninjitsu&quot; thing, all of it rarely ever changes. It feels so old and worn out, nothing else catches my eyes. Sound: - 7.8/10 (C+) This is where i change my tone for the most part. I can honestly say i like every single opening of Naruto, it fits the mood for the first 1:30 of the show, then the other 21 minutes is just horrible. The soundtrack is alright, but just that. Character: - 4.8/10 (F) We have: Naruto, our favorite ramen-loving, orange jumpsuit ninja. Ok? We mostly have the same old characters until we get Jiraya and Orochimaru and Itachi. Even with them, it still feels so old and dead by now, that's where i stopped watching it. Enjoyment: - 8.0/10 (B) So why the hell did i enjoy it? Well, it seems that EVERY SINGLE EPISODE, Naruto screws up. That there is enjoyment. Whether it's an assault by Sakura, or just plain screw up, i love it (it's supposed to be a bad thing, by the way.). I can watch the filler episodes and just laugh so damn hard at Naruto failing.

"Naruto is recommended because it offers a unique blend of action, adventure, and heartfelt storytelling that has resonated with a diverse audience. Despite its imperfections, the series has left a lasting legacy and will continue to be enjoyed by both new and seasoned anime enthusiasts. Let's start with the obvious elephant in the room - 1. The notorious filler episodes. ""Naruto"" is plagued by filler arcs that sometimes feel like a detour through the ninja equivalent of a scenic route. A lot of it are outright cringe-worthy and has no significance or much value added to the main story. Pacing Predicament: 2. The pacing in ""Naruto"" is a bit like trying to sprint a marathon. While the main story arcs are engaging, there are moments when the series seems to stall, especially in the earlier episodes. 3. Flashbacks are to ""Naruto"" what ramen is to Naruto himself – a staple. Yet, there are times when the flashbacks are reused to the point of inducing eye-rolls. We get it; Naruto had a tough childhood. 4. Sakura, the resident kunoichi of Team 7, gets a fair share of criticism for her lack of growth and action compared to her ninja peers. It's a missed opportunity for a more dynamic and developed character. 5. World Building - Inconsistencies in Technological Progression. The series incorporates both traditional and advanced technology, with a mix of feudal-era settings and modern elements. Like many viewers, I find the progression of technology in the world inconsistent, raising questions about the timeline and development of certain technologies. Now, for the Good parts of Naruto: 1. The side characters in Naruto are often considered one of the anime's notable strengths and contribute to what sets it apart from other series. Naruto introduces a vast array of characters, each with distinct personalities, abilities, and backgrounds. From the members of Team 7 to other ninjas in the Hidden Leaf Village and beyond, the series provides a diverse and memorable cast. Many side characters undergo significant development throughout the series. The narrative takes the time to explore their personal stories, challenges, and growth, giving viewers a deeper understanding of their characters. Unlike some anime where secondary characters might fade into the background during battles, Naruto emphasizes the strategic roles of its side characters. Each ninja has a unique set of skills, and their contributions often play crucial roles in major conflicts. The series showcases a wide variety of fighting styles, jutsu techniques, and combat strategies among its characters. This diversity adds depth to the battles and makes each character's approach to combat distinctive. 2. Naruto introduces a wide array of characters, each with unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. The character development, particularly of the main cast, is a standout aspect, showcasing growth, maturity, and the impact of their experiences. 3. The series is adept at delivering emotionally charged narratives. Whether exploring themes of friendship, loss, or determination, ""Naruto"" has poignant storytelling moments that resonate with viewers on a deep, emotional level. Iconic Soundtrack: 4. Naruto features a memorable and iconic soundtrack that enhances the emotional impact of key scenes. The music, composed by Toshio Masuda and Yasuharu Takanashi, has become synonymous with the series and contributes to its overall atmosphere. 5. Epic Battles and Animation - The anime is renowned for its intense and well-animated battle sequences. The choreography of the ninja fights, the utilization of jutsu, and the strategic elements in combat contribute to the series' excitement and visual appeal. 6. The series employs long-term story arcs that allow for extensive character development and world-building.

"Okay so the art and sound was of any anime, but that's not the point. The story seemed intesting at one point, but it fell apart. Way too nija cliché . It was devastating. I heard so much about this series and was expecting so much more. The characters were simple. The main character was the ""apprentice wants to become the best there is and travels with his friends to achieve his goal"" kind, which we haven't seen much of *coughPOKEMONcough*. It was dumb. And the humor was terrible too. I think that this anime is really only meant for anime junkies or otakus who don't care much for the story and just care for the cool outfits and sayings in the stories. This story had way too much of bad comedy, obssessed girls(which tried too hard to be funny and it sucked), and a lame plot. It really ticks me off that people even dare compare this series to Bleach. ? Really? Bleach actually has some depth to the plot and some sensibility in it.

"I first watched Naruto, by way of fansubs, when it had just come out and it was still only in the Japnese audience. I remember that I was instantly hooked after watching the first maybe five episodes and because of that continued to follow the series. Basically, I can tell you that the story is pretty decent. At the beginning it takes some time for them to get to the true plot line which is Naruto's nine tail fox; however, the arcs before the real plot line present a basis for the main plot line. And, I can honestly say that while I was watching the arcs like the &quot;wave country&quot; and etc etc, that it was quite entertaining and it was a &quot;page turner&quot;. Nonetheless, the entire story is a bit stereotypical, but it is enjoyable nevertheless. The whole story is action-packed w/ plenty of comedy. The characters are a bit stereotypical as well. Naruto is the hero that people don't understand; Sasuke is the loner that nobody can understand. However, this is not a problem as the way they present them seem to be original in itself. Well, overall I could write a lot more about this series, but if me to get to the point then here it is. The fillers killed this series, like no other. I think that there are actually more fillers in Naruto then there is real episodes. Therefore, what should you do to remedy this fact? You should just skip all fillers and head straight to the main plot because the main plot is something that is quite interesting and entertaining, while the fillers are just plain horrible and bad. Believe me, I tried to watch some of them and the fillers of Naruto were extrememly boring and had no originality whatsoever.

"Besides having a cool theme/platform, Naruto doesn't have too much to offer. Even though this anime is ridiculously comical and annoying at times(due to over-exposition) it also has a very likable story. Naruto didn't exactly play it safe with all of its hidden secrets the story is based around, secrets that are completely shielded hundreds of episodes into the series. Its clear that what still keeps Naruto shining as a story is its characters, say what you want but Naruto is definitely considered to be the most recognized anime ever--and the general story isn't exactly a masterpiece. So, about those characters: Am I implying that without them being exactly how they are Naruto would've failed? NO. The idea of such a sad upbringing leading up to these characters is what makes them so much more special. In the first episodes of Naruto you're getting a glimpse of what Narutos entire childhood has been like, and before you know it things are lookin' up! This makes you feel personally attached to Naruto or at the very least makes you appreciate how much you get to see Naruto progress throughout the show(which, is what the show is solely about for the most part). The main problem people have with Naruto is; it's 'mainstream' or 'too hyped', both of which are formed from peer pressure basically. Mainstream is not a bad thing, it just means they're giving people what they know they want. As long as it's still enjoyable who cares? And as for the hype, all I have to say is: Nothing great(whether positive or negative) goes without hype, does hype change anything though? Hype always comes with a reason. Example: R*pe. Lastly I'd just like to say, MOST ANIMES AREN'T MEANT TO BE PERFECT--JUST ENJOYABLE. I've seent many animes and I like all types - can't you stop trying to be a critic and just try to enjoy it? I did and its only made me happier, so why not? - Thanks.",8,Recommended,"May 30, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_034942264f,4,1885
"The first time I watched this series; to be honest, once I got into Shippuden it was so great that I ended up underestimating the original 220 episodes. After a long time since then I'm realizing how much foreshadowing the first show sets up for Shippuden's greatness, things I totally forgot were introduced so early in the story and now I appreciate the original show much much more. The first time I had my sights set on action before anything else in anime and that made me blind to everything else this show has to offer and immediately compared the sequel to it claiming to myself that the sequel was better. They are great together as one unit, believe it! MOTTO? Why do people get so annoyed by Naruto's believe it motto, it's better than Sakura's chaa! At least believe it means something. Point is, a lot of characters have their repeated catch phrases so stop the nonsense about this. SUB or DUB? First time I watched this show was subbed, this time around I'm doing dubbed. It just happened that way. I like both honestly. A great way to find out which you'd prefer without someone else's opinion - just pick one, when you get to a sequence of scenes that you really like rewatch it in the other language then pick the one you prefer. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter - I read really fast when there's subtitles, I don't read them to myself in my mind, as quickly as I skim with my eyes I have absorbed the context and dialog and yet still you miss some visuals that way so it's up to you. FILLER? Honestly in any long running show not every cannon episode is something so great. Some filler episodes are crappy, some cannon episodes are crappy. The only reason that is is because our minds are constantly comparing things, so you just have to shut it off and let the story consume your attention.",10,Recommended,"Oct 29, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b964e93d63,4,1823
"Well I have to say I was dissaponted in this anime a bit. Its very over exaggerated. Well the characters are much too simple and lack depth. Though they are comical which could be a decent aspect. Characters here tend to tug at my tolerance. They dont feel relateable. I dont feel that connection between character and audience. Honestly the main character{Naruto} just seems to piss and moan. Theres too many fillers and fights drag on for episodes. The art is bearable. But the plot isnt too complex either and theres almost no plot twists. For older audieneces, I feel this is more like a waste of time. That audienece have tendency to enjoymore thought provoking shows.

Throw this at their faces and if all goes well (it did, for me) theyll be begging you for more. A boy that is destined to be hated for life, alone and sad forever. Naruto shows that no matter what kind of society that you in and no matter what is thrown against you, you are the key that makes it better for yourself. Written down in a world where ninjas and inner spirit power (Chakra) takes place, it opens up a new way of how we or should i say, i, look at ninjas. Forbidden techniques, country-colonizing, 3 man teams. You wont know what ninjas really do after you watch this. Sadly, to me it kind of lost a great deal of fans. A year long series-killer, fillers. Yes. It started off to be quite entertaining but before long, the episodes were like aired as though it was just to keep it going while the manga side runs on.

"For some reason loads of people like this anime, I really do not get that. I watched the show until a certain villain (do not want to spoil it for others, just because I am civil) died, because the villain was the most interesting character. I mean: Naruto. Uninteresting character with the""a super powerful creature is inside you"" cliche (seen it in yu yu hakusho, bleach ans a ton of other shows). What does he want to be? A ninja... That is the begin motivation and then I wonder ""how do I connect to this character?"". Then the failed attempts to make him funny make him annoying, his power is not that interesting and then I did some research and it will only become worse. Sakura. What is there to say about her? did she do anything in the first 2 seasons? well... she jumped before an old man to protect him with a kunai... and failed to do so. And that is all my faulty memory remembers about her. Sasuke. Somehow he is the beef cake bad boy personage, that got girls in real life swooning over him, I really do not get you people... He is bland and monotone, but hey at least he does things! Fights. Nothing that we have not seen being done better in older anime (yu yu hakusho for example, hell even dragonball and flame of recca were better in fight scenes). Big weapons are being used (what use is a shurken if it is foldable and has a diameter of one meter?) mostly and when they use their kunai their utterly useless. Then they use their ninja magic to fight, sasuke mostly breathes fire, naruto copies himself and sakura does nothing. No real tension in this anime from what I have seen and does not really motivates me to look further (and I watched some horrible anime, willingly (though they're not on my list because they are quite obscure and I forgot their names...)). Premise. Ninja ninja ninja ninja, ninja ninja, believe it! Even though they are not ninja's since they do not use any stealth, I can forgive them calling themselves ninja's, the problem is that they keep putting attention to it! WE GET IT YOU ARE A NINJA AND NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE IT! STOP SAYING THAT! And Naruto has some kind of 9 tailed rabbit thing that says it is a fox sealed inside him for a reason and there are people with very unusual weapons that would not be that good in our world, but hey suspension of disbelieve, eh?

"-The fans are waiting for the plot to continue, we need to delay it. We will need fillers, lots of fillers. -Hundrends of fillers... -But my lord, there is no such force... ""doors open to reveal a sea of fillers"" -This night... You will feast on the patience of fans!!!! ""But Bleach had a lot of fillers! And you gave it a perfect 10!!! You hypocrite!"" Yes, but Bleach had filler ARCS! Consistent, well directed, logically lengthed, ARCS! And gradually improving ones too. The Nozomi Arc (the last one) was in fact as good as the main story if not better. Naruto on the other hand has one-shot episodes. AWFULLY written, one-episode fillers that add nothing to the story and are in fact a real pain to watch. Also, Bleach didn't interrupt the main story more than the number of Filler Arcs. Naruto on the other hand usually throws one main story episode and follows it with a filler one. This is unbelievably annoying, as you feel the story keeps getting interrupted by fillers. CONSTANTLY. Main story episodes concerned, Naruto offers amazing battles (especially the exam episodes at the start of the series were AWESOME) that leave you really impressed. The rules of combat are well explained (moves cannot be repeated indefinitely, every skill has a weakness, people get tired, etc etc) and the music makes the fights all the better (keep in mind that the length of the fights is pretty good). Character designs are also very distinctive, so that, like bleach, you will remember almost everyone (and unlike One Piece I might add). A problem that appears halfway through the anime and starts appearing waaaayyy too often later on, is the obsession of the mangaka with ""history repeating itself"". The first time this became evident it was quite cool, as you didn't expect such a good ideology from the script. The second time you still liked it but a bit less. The third time you just patiently waited for the anime to get over with it. AFTER 100 TIMES IT'S REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF. Every team in existance is composed of 2 men and one woman. One of the men is quite serious and cool, the other is a fool that constantly draws attention to himself by acting stupid, but is in truth the big-hearted one. EVERY, F$%KING, TEAM. Calling the plot ""repetitive"" would be the understatement of the year. Another thing that quickly becomes annoying, especially in Shippuden, is how the show constantly throws at us that Naruto had a rough, unfair childhood. Again, the first time it was a very welcome addition to the anime, showing how far Naruto has come to be respected by his peers. But when it's done in every single episode you really start hating it. No more flashbacks please! I don't care how much money you save with the animators! Get on with the plot! If the above weren't enough out of the three main characters (Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura) Naruto is a complete idiot, Sasuke can't decide between being emo, an avenger or Itachi's little brother and Sakura keeps pursuing the same guy for about... The whole anime + Shippuden. Not the most inspiring of leads to be sure. In fact if it wasn't for the awesome battle music I'm pretty sure Naruto would be hated by everyone. (Oh and for the record: I absolutely hate Jiraya as a character, there I said it!)

"Erm. Yes, I'm advocating for the positive side of Naruto... Just don't shoot the messenger :P Currently, there are 26 reviews written for Naruto, out of which roughly more than half advocate that Naruto sucks, is not worth watching, and is simply overrated. Right. So we know that the fillers are horrible, the plot's &quot;typically shounen&quot; and Sakura never does a single thing. But why exactly has Naruto become so popular? What makes it tick? What keeps reeling in the dough for Kishimoto? There are a variety of reasons. Naruto is the very embodiment of the shounen psyche. It deals with some common fundamental themes that appeal to the audience. Valuing your friends, never giving up, and challenging the status quo are just a couple messages conveyed by Naruto's plight. And we, the viewers, can relate to those themes. Supposedly. Then of course, are the insane battle scenes. True, some battles are incapable of suspending disbelief, as you think &quot;that's doesn't make sense.&quot; Then there are the parts where someone has to explain every move he makes. However, overall, the animation, the music, and the &quot;situation&quot; all add up into something that excites and awakens the ninja within us. (Wow, that was corny) There's also a fair bit of humor involved. Most of it is slapstick comedy, such as the teasing born from the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry, while other comic scenes truly manage to touch the humerus (episode 101, anyone?). However, some of the older viewers are nonplussed by many scenes which simply come across as stupid and juvenile. Though i'm sure Kishimoto knew crass humor is a double edged sword at times. Finally, Naruto is often geared towards younger viewers. Yes, those little midgets everyone ignores on internet forums and discussion boards (lovingly referred to as &quot;Narutards&quot;) are probably the greatest reason why Naruto has gained such popularity. This review was hastily manufactured at 3:12am.

"So. Naruto is a great show. I think a lot of people get too comfortable being so critical of this show when they forget this series debuted in 2002, over twenty years ago. Look at the other shows from this year, none of their names are particularly famous. So now when people watch this show with the expectation that it is the best thing out there, (when they became anime fans later on and watched a plethora of other shows beforehand) they forget that this show is a product of its time. When I watched Naruto, there was the ""big three of Shonen"" One Piece, Naruto, and Bleach (Dragon Ball, Evangelion, Inuyasha and Yu Yu Hakusho were a bit earlier). It's hard to speak about Naruto and ignore the impact the show had on the anime industry as a whole. Naruto brought a lot of international anime fans, and there's a reason; not only are the story and characters compelling but the animation is good. I won't lie, there is a lot of ""filler,"" but if you look at the bigger picture the filler adds important characterization to the story. Naruto is one of my favorite shows, so much so that I wrote about it in my diary when I was younger. The soundtrack also SLAPS. Since this review is only for the original and not for Shippuden, I will give it a higher score. While yes, Shippuden shares qualities with the original, there were some misses in its execution. ANYWAYS, I think critique is good, but people need to realize this is a 20+ year-old show, from a different time, when there were fewer international anime fans, and when anime wasn't as mass-produced as it is now.

Well, first off, yeah this was the first Anime I saw, hence I loved it, but that ended quite horridly some episodes after episode 80, when it started falling, and I mean FALLING from grace, it fell so hard I nearly cried. It started out as a great anime but turned out to be some repetitive piece of crap.(Spoiler) I must say that no anime has had me as close to crying as this one from the things that happened around the Zabuza time(Spoiler). So my advice is to only watch up to about 80. (Only for those who have seen it all) : What pissed me the most of is when they repeat the EXACT thing that happened around the Zabuza time with that other 'sword dude' who has two swords instead of the gigantic Zabuza one.

"Listen listen listen. You need to know that I'm reviewing this based on the canon parts of Naruto. The reason it's probably rated so low on average on MAL is because of the amount of filler that's in it. If I was taking all that into account, I'd probably more likely rate this series an 8 instead of a 10. However, since I'm not going to do that, please let me tell you why Naruto is one of the best anime to be made. The story in its barest form isn't all that original, right? It's typical Shounen, so I can't really vouch for the astounding, original plot. However, I can and will brag on the story that was told through this anime. Before I do that, though, I will point out that the pacing of the plot does sort of ignore unnecessary things. It may feel to you that's it's moving a bit swiftly because there isn't a whole lot of buffer between arcs, and the arcs don't waste any time getting to their main point. That being said, I absolutely love this coming-of-age story. I think it translates loneliness and childhood really nicely into a fantastical universe. Though, as I said, the pacing is a bit fast, the story itself blends really well to the point where you can't really tell the difference between where one arc ends and another begins. I can't brag on the details of the story too much because I don't want to give it away, but it makes you feel empowered, and though the bare plot isn't original at all, the way its told has multitudes of personality. On to the characters. I always say that great characters are necessary for a story to be good, and in fact, they can even carry a terrible story if they need to. Naruto has a brilliant story, but its characters are what make it so beautiful. For one thing, this anime isn't afraid to make every moment an important one for a specific character, and I like that because it means that we get to see these characters grow up and change in a realistic way. Also, the friendships that are created through the story really make it worth watching, if nothing else. The strong bonds that are formed are portrayed really well, and I think they're used well also. What I mean by that is these characters are written in such a way that they each affect each other at every point in the story. It's a cool way to depict friendship. I'm very bad at reviews, but let me leave you with this at least: watch this anime. If you need to skip the fillers to enjoy it, do it, but the main story is so worth it. The voice actors are amazing, it's brilliantly funny, and it'll touch your heart in a way nothing else has. It's a classic for a reason, I really don't think you'll find anything quite like this anywhere else. And, if nothing else, I hear the sequel series is way better, so you may as well watch this and then have a good time with that. I'm sure going to.

"Well, you've got to admit Naruto is one of the most popular anime in the world, also because it's also aired in the US. However, popularity does not represent everything. Naruto, definitely was very ideal and imaginative with these super ninjas. The three main characters, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura, all had a close relationship for they have been in a team for most of their time. Naruto and Sasuke, who were supposedly natural rivals, fought their best to compete each other and tease about the others' loss. By the time this arch enemy Orochimaru comes, this anime changes its environment. For the whole entire time, Sasuke leaves with Orochimaru, and therefore Naruto and Sakura tries their best to regain their lost friend. They all realize missing a friend could be fairly drastic towards everyday life. They tend to become stronger and fight with devilish opponents to move on and retrieve Sasuke. However, on the other hand, Sasuke refuses and once tried to kill Naruto because he had another objective in mind. Then, what kind of anime is this? Naruto and Sakura wants Sasuke back; they need him to be happy and believe that would do best for him. On the other hand, Sasuke refuses and fights back because he doesn't feel happiness in between their friendship. He wants to kill his brother who destroyed his clan. In the future, &quot;if&quot; Naruto ever caught Sasuke, what would they even do? Put him in a cage and lock him so that he won't escape? That's totally ironic! They want him back, but they know he's become all crazy, so they don't know what to do, but to seriously injure him so that he won't go back to his evil scheme. Is that even true friendship? The music is definitely great, for it gives different types of ideas. The music provides the thought of living in a peaceful village and swaying through history. One certain types of music from Naruto, it gives the idea of exciting actions full of thrill. The sound produced in Naruto is indubitably original and unique. The part where I enjoyed Naruto the most would be the beginning, where all of the story tends to make sense.

"I first watched Naruto as a teenager, around when it was released, and thought it was dumb and dull. Now nearly 20 years later, as a 34 year-old, I decided to revisit it...and am more confused by its popularity than ever. Shounen series had been around for a long time when Naruto was adapted into an anime in the early 2000s. Weekly Shonen Jump began publishing in 1968 and big hits like ""Ashita no Joe"" and ""Tiger Mask"" followed soon after. Monster 80's hits like ""Hokuto no Ken"" and ""Dragonball"" would define anime for the decade and spawned a slew of imitators. Now, shounen is a formulaic genre (main character becomes stronger to defeat increasingly menacing foes), but that doesn't mean one can't do interesting things with it, or create very good, even great series. What strikes me the most about Naruto is how shabby and uninspired it is. In terms of plot, characters, and even the art, it resembles a forgettable early 90's shounen that poorly and lazily tries to copy more successful properties. To begin with, the art is basic and undetailed, and looks shockingly bad for an anime made after 2000. Faces lack distinguishing features aside from hair and eyes, and even the bodies are often interachangeable. It gets even worse with any action sequence, a central aspect to any shounen. The movement of the characters is all wrong, resembling that of an ungainly trash bag rather than actual human motion. One way the animators try to make up for this shortcoming is reducing the number of frames used, but that makes it even worse. Oftentimes, we see nothing between a character staring at an opponent and then suddenly hitting them. All the wind-up and movement in-between is ignored. For a series set in a secretive ninja world, it's surprisingly small and drab. There are very few characters that truly matter, and we meet most of them at the beginning. Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Hinata, who we encounter in a dingy classroom in the first episode, are the four main characters, and shape the ninja world as much as anyone. The Third Hokage, the most powerful ruler, is also met in Episode 1, and presented as no one special, just an old man administrator. Rather than a rich, expansive world with mysteries and an abundance of unique, competing groups and ninjas, Naruto feels meager and limited. It doesn't help that the villains are largely forgettable, too. Shounen heroes take a variety of forms. Some are more reserved and stoic, while others are passionate firebrands. However, all the successful ones have one trait in common. They're cool. Whether it's the silent badass or the manic underdog who refuses to give up, these are heroes young male viewers respect and want to be like. By contrast, Naruto Uzumaki is lame. He is loud and annoying. He doesn't take his ninja studies seriously, or ever demonstrate a consistent dedication to becoming stronger or better. And yet, through a deus ex machina, at a critical moment in a fight he says something menacing and threatening, which sounds laughable coming from this clown, and quickly wins. There's nothing cool here. His victories feel undeserved and he reminds me of the loser spastics back in school that no one liked, not anyone worthy or aspirational. Lastly, the writing is lazy, riddled with plot holes, and disrespects its own world. Take the very first episode, for instance. The Third Hokage is able to see Naruto through a crystal ball. Why then are the ninjas he deployed to find him unable to do so until Naruto triumphantly returns many hours later? Did the Hokage not communicate with his retainers? Do ninjas have no form of communication, and were none of the ninjas left behind at the village to protect it or receive further orders? The actual answer is much simpler. Interference would have spoiled the scene of Naruto defeating a treacherous adult ninja, and the writers hoped the viewers wouldn't think too hard. But there is a much worse scene in the first episode. At the beginning, using a Clone jutsu for a school exam, Naruto is only able to summon one copy of himself, and a useless one at that. Later, at the climax of his fight against the treacherous ninja, he summons countless dozens of clones, all capable of effective combat. What changed? This sensational improvement occurred in less than a day with just a little more practice on Naruto's part. In other words, we're meant to believe he was a miserable failure after presumably months or years of training, yet is a spectacular success after less than a day. Incoherence aside, if a jutsu can be mastered so thoroughly with less than a day's effort, then jutsus are simple and unimpressive. After all, would you respect anything, like Tic-Tac-Toe, that could be mastered in less than a day? Notice that even a flawed series like Dragonball treated martial arts with far more reverence. Fighters would make great strides only after training for weeks, months, or years. And this was usually not any normal training, but under the guidance of a legendary figure (Master Roshi, the Kais, etc.), frequently in a unique environment, like the Hypberbolic Time Chamber. In this way, the series conveyed the difficulty and magnitude of attaining a higher power level or learning a technique. In Naruto, however, all it takes is less than a day's practice, so we must conclude that this is all child's play. (And given that these powerful ninjas beating up adults are in fact children, it is!) Of course, there are further plot holes here, as Naruto spawning 100+ copies of himself should easily defeat countless future enemies, but he conveniently doesn't always use it. Or waits to do so. Thus, we see that in every regard, Naruto is a very lousy, uninspired example of the shounen genre. The real mystery is how it ever became financially successful. I might not necessarily like other megapopular shounen, but in every other case, I can understand their popularity and acknowledge that it had either good or unique qualities. Naruto, meanwhile, flat-out sucks.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 5, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b95c6fadd1,4,6019

"Well, well here's Naruto. Oh joy. OK before I start reviewing this I would like to point out that this is a review and therefore it will contain the personal opinions of the person in cause, me. What was the point of me saying that, one may wonder? Well, simply put, it's due to the fact I'm well aware of Naruto's huge popularity and therefore I'm certain a lot of people that will read this review will, probably, find themselves frustrated of what will they consider of me being completely devoid of any taste in anime for not realizing the geniousness of this anime. Now with that outta the way let's head on the review. What's most important for any anime? Of course the story. I'll be direct and say that the story , in my case, is nothing short of dreadful, and therefore get's the 2 thumbs up from me. It's based around a kid, who so happens to have lost his parents, and therefore is an orphan, and the challenges he'll face in his quest to become the greatest ninja in his village, which is called Hokage by the way. Seems simple but yet intriguing now doesn't it. Well so have I though till I actually gave it a watch. To my surprise the story falls flat on it's face from the very first episodes. This is mostly due to the story itselfs being in contradiction with the world in which it develops or maybe the other way 'round. The plot device here is the ninja world. However in Naruto's world, the ninjas seems to be the inverted version. Where a ninja has to be stealthy and calculated, here most ofem shout, scream, jump head-on in a confrontation and apparently don't even bother wearing proper uniform, something to help disguese them, instead prefering to walk around in bright colors so that everyone may notice them. Art get's a 5. All I can say bout it is that it was good but overuse of recycled scenes made it eem cheap and there less enjoyable to watch as the series progressed. Sound get's the 6. It's great that's for sure but unfortunately it suffers from the same problem as the art of the show. As the series progressed the soundtracks ued got cut down untill eventually they ended up recycling 4-5 more memorable soundtracks for every episode that followed while the others went into complete obscurity. Character. Oh boy. 1. I really feel sorry for their characters. Aside from the main characters the rest are underdeveloped and bland, and some go as far as succumbling to certain stereotypes. Example: A fat guy in one group that thinks alwys 'bout food, eats all the time, and oh wait he can also use a technique which makes him even fatter. Yeah, if that's the idea of a character of a comedic value than to Naruto's misfortune it's long overdue. And ther re lots more. Smart kid who is too smart to even bother, kid who ties to win his crush over by standing up to the guy who seems to popular, guy too popular but who doesn't care about anything etc. And the list could go on. To underdevelop a character is one thing but to completely throw out the window the ntion of balance between is completely another. And again, while this is bad, Naruto seems to excel at this. Main characters get stronger by learning new powers while old ones are stuck with the very powers they started with and as the enemies appearing get stronger and stronger the only thing these side characters end up showing is how useless they've become or are becoming. And the main character is also a reason the whole show falls. His annoying and completely unlikeble. Ok Naruto we get it that you're an orphan and despite that you have the guts to stand up to the injustice that life's done you and pursue your dreams but that isn't a reason to keep remnding us this every episode. And also the sheer amount of positivity in this guy in contrast with how he behaves is something that is completely unrealistic. The choice in doing such a character also limits his development possibilities which in turn diminishes the viewers interste in even following this character. He's not worth it. You already know he has a strong belief in the morale values he upholds and , therefore, regardless of watever challenges he faces he'll always pull it off 'cuz of his strong beliefs. But his constant reminder of this aspect of him really makes unlikeble due to the fact that after a while it gets anoying and can't help but give a weird sensation that the show is just trying to scold you and shove it's morale lessons down your throat. With this said I can only state that I hardly enjoyed Naruto and to put it in a nutshell, it gets a 3 on the Enjoyment meeter but that's only due to moments of amusement from how ridiculous this whole show is and of how hard it tries to be serious. Overall I give it a 2. The art and sound doesn't save the show from me giving it a 2 due to the fact that, as well as they might be, the whole experience is poor.

"Naruto was one of my first anime that I just found randomly on TV. After that I watched like first 35 episodes and then they stopped it... I really liked Sasuke and Naruto, and even then Sakura was useless at least I though so. What got me into it? It probably has to be the idea of ninjas, wars and mostly Naruto's and Sasuke's back story. The idea of a fox that was sealed inside a little boy was mind blowing to me. And that everyone hated him, because of it kinda reminded me where I was at the time. The openings was really good as well, but there was some openings that I didn't really enjoyed as much as others. Watching this anime was a great experience, because after they stopped airing it on TV I remembered about it after 2 yrs ago and then got really into it... Naruto thought me one thing: It's to never give up, no matter how bad it looks.",7,Recommended,"Feb 23, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_822f962da0,5,854
"Naruto is SOOOOOO popular. All anime fans know of Naruto. Even non anime fans know about Naruto. I'm always surprised when I see that someone has never heard of Naruto before. Anyway..................Story: 10/10 The good thing about Naruto is the UNIVERSE. There are many villages, the villages have ninjas who can use jutsu. Jounin, Chuunin, Genin, Hokage, ANBU.... And the awesome story where Character:10/10 the main character is a lonely orphan with a demon fox sealed inside him, so the entire village hates him. That's an impressive fact. Naruto. And the other main character is a boy who's older brother killed his entire family/clan. Wow. Sasuke. The third main character is a normal girl with nothing special about her and a hell annoying personality. OK. Sakura. Boring 0/10 So Sakura gets a lot of hate. But the good thing about this character is that she gives us a lot to expand upon, if we use our imagination or write fanfiction like Sakura's Glasses where you can give her the Sharingan or whatever powers you want or place her wherever you want in the plot or make her get trained by Obito or something. 10/10 Basically this is the best anime because it lets readers get creative with the characters and make fanart, fanfiction, doujinshi, yaoi, etc. So even if the story is lame, the universe is good and makes up for the rest. And it's still an interesting story. JUST, make sure you skip all the fillers because it has nothing to do with the story, it's a waste of time unless you don't mind comedy episodes (for me it's hard to humor me and I hate all things comedy so I hate fillers,) Then it will be good.

"The creator of Naruto series is written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto sensei all he had to do is to create one of the greatest manga work and eventually lead to anime adaptation by one of the significant studio by Studio Pierrot for visual treat. Naruto is based on the shinobi jonor in which we all get to know about the various themes and elements of hardships, leadership, importance of friendship, realities, loneliness, hatredness, student and teacher relationship, sacrifices etc. STORY Naruto is a fictional story regarding the adventures of the protagonist of the series Uzumaki Naruto along with his companions. Naruto aims to be the Hokage ( Highest office ) of the village Konahagakure. Naruto is crazy and troublesome guy who always trouble people for gaining recognition, as his parents died for a noble cause. Naruto is an orphan and always it's a sad to see as no one consider him as a person and they treat him like demon. Naruto is a weak shinobi. But there it comes with the load of background music there starts the journey of Naruto in which, what, why he able to defeat odds, how he is successful, sets a new definition of friendship in manga and anime. CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT Along with Naruto there are many other exceptional characters. Most of the characters have background stories which is great for Shounen long running anime. It's always a good insight for a anime to show the depths of the characters and their goals. Even senseis role is almost the backbone of the story where they mould their students for making them full fledged shinobi. There are some episodes in which scenes are emotions based on the reality grounded and I got tears. So, I want to share one of my experiences regarding a character Rock Lee when he fights Gaara in Chunin exams when he was fighting very hard and had tough times in which there was a flashback of him and sensei regarding discussion of hardwork. And his sensei states to Rock Lee that ""you are genius at hardwork"" . And then Rock Lee gets tears in his eyes and looks at his sensei and offers his gratitude during the fight. I liked the description of most of the characters and their evolutions by bringing new techniques for making fights more intense and insane. I admit that most of the characters shared coordinal relationship with Naruto and it took shape brilliantly by Kishimoto sensei. Most of the companions of Naruto they considered Naruto as a inspiration. ANIMATION It was a great prospect for Naruto anime series that it was adapted by Studio Pierrot. Animation at the times of 2000's was not good for present generation but I have to respect the those times and I have to move on. Fight scenes are very rich and intense fights are shown very well. The characters are shown very fluently but there are some errors regarding the animation it sulks little bit though I enjoyed. The village and forest scenes shown very excellent by covering all kinds of backgrounds well captured by studio Pierrot. It was a good animation and it was very pleasant and satisfied regarding the various techniques in the fight scenes are shown with extreme mix and caution. At last I want to say that Studio Pierrot didn't disappointed me in animation. MUSIC Mostly I like this segment just sounds wow regarding some of the openings of Naruto is well shown and they showed situation driven oriented related openings in every arc. Background music of Naruto is worth mentioning regarding the intense rage, excited, emotion based is great while fight scenes got boost due to the background music. Background music represented each and every scenes and situations, even humor fittingly. So far they did great job for handling the Naruto work. For Orochmaru character the background music was nail bitting. When the characters use their jutsu in fights the music was getting better and better and I liked the intensity of music and it is a great plus for Naruto anime series. SPECIAL MENTION In Naruto series most of them stated that there are so many fillers in which most fillers ruined the complexity of the story and there are some fillers which are worth watching. I to agree. So if u skip the fillers or if you watch the fillers that's completely based on your schedule and interest. I watched fillers and I found some of them are annoying and some sort of lengthy narration ruined the episodes and some are great. If you are starters then go and watch Naruto anime which gives you a great platform as a anime watcher. It is a great and simple story which the characters justifies themselves with all sorts of elements shown in a typical Shounen anime. CONCLUSION At last I want to conclude that Naruto is by far one of the greatest anime. I want to acknowledge their efforts and hardwork of Masashi Kishimoto sensei, Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo etc put in this whole series is great and best in it's own way. I enjoyed myself like never before. When I remember the character Naruto I always become emotion, passion, excited that I wanted to follow his ninja way and his philosophy.",9,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_602e25c7f9,5,5049

"Ah.... Memories. Aside from Pokemon and Digmon, I can proudly say that this was my first anime series. For this review, I would only be covering on the Naruto series not the Shippuden one. The series portrays a young ninja named Naruto that aims to become the next Hokage(Leader) of the Hidden Leaf Village. I'll start off with good parts of this anime, the story or plot line is brilliantly done, with good twists every now and then makes the viewers ever more curious to know what is coming next, this is what truly makes the series addicting. Character wise, really good back story for each of the characters, although most of the supporting characters of the series is shown on Shippuden. Even so, the series tried its best to form a relationship between the reader and the characters which render the viewers more attached to the series and thus creates ""viewers loyalty"" As there is light, there will always be shadows, one of the main cons of this series is that with episodes reaching over hundreds, there are way too many fillers and unnecessary mini-stories. I understand that the purpose of fillers is to make time and space for the writers to come up with idea for the main story line, but sometimes the fillers are way too long. The visuals are not as well done compared with other anime. For instance comparing it with the 2006 anime series Fate Stay Night, the visuals are quite lackluster. With that being said, the pros of this series clearly outshines its cons. In my opinion, the story line of the anime is much more of significance compared with visuals and such. Oh yea, there are way too many openings and ending songs too cover, but leave it at that, some are good and some mediocre. All in all, this is one of the anime that I would consider a gem and would hold a special place in me as this is also the anime that brought me into the anime universe.",9,Recommended,"Jul 8, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9e6eb0717c,5,1875
"I’m not ashamed to admit that I love Naruto. It is my favourite anime of all time and no matter how good the anime is that i watch in the future nothing can ever compare to the feeling of nostalgia i have towards this amazing show, Naruto was one of this first proper anime i ever watched and growing up watching the same characters grow and get stronger made me enjoy every episode even more. Naruro is known as one of the ""Forbidden 4"" it is one of the biggest anime of all time and is still going to this day (as of making this review), the only thing i can say is if you want to watch a anime with an amazing cast of characters a long running show that you can watch for hours on end with amazing fights and great story arcs then i highly recommend checking this show out then watching its successor Naruto Shippuden. This review might seem a little biased and not very helpful but its hard to find anything wrong with a show you love so much, sure the animation might not be great anymore and there is alot of fillers but if you can look past that the story makes up for it, and at the end of the day great characters and an amazing story is more than enough to check this out in my opinion.",10,Recommended,"Apr 26, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9c7cacd635,5,1196
"Oh my. Naruto. I almost shed a tear when rated it so low, because i wanted it to be any better than what it has become. Naruto is for me on of the best anime out there if you only count from episode ONE to NINETY NINE. It has commedy, no romance, action and excelent fights and a great character development for the protagonist and perhaps other ""sub"" characters like gaara for instance. The way naruto finds his way to release the ""hidden fox"" inside of him and the way naruto rivals with sasuke who would later become his best friend and enemy is superb. In the beggining he is much of a wuss, but he gains strength little by little through tough training and lamen eating... (~datte ba yo ! ^^) and not through inconsistents powerupps !!! === BUT === After episode 99, there're fillers and the story starts to get slowed down so much that one episode would contain half of the last episode in the form of flashbacks and the other half being flashbacks of earlier parts of the SAME EPISODE... until it gets to a point where you would get FULL SEASONS OF FILLERS and the anime starts to get UNWATCHABLE. But people tend to forget/ignore this move and that's why he is just another OVERATED series here in anime list. So if you rate naruto for only his 99 first episodes (10+++) but as a whole series with 220 episodes in total (3~) we get about 45% of the anime being very good and the whole rest not. Naruto still managed to have a sequence as bad (or worst) than its fillers, called Naruto ShiFillerDen... Just to finish it, the protagonist has his own name as the title of the series, wich means we can't expect that he will ever die. xD",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 26, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0a76133944,5,1641

"Many people out there love Naruto and I can see why. The characters are compelling, varied and interesting and the storytelling has many parts that are likable. But there are three big problems that drags everything down. Here they are. 1: No-one ever changes This is mostly true for Naruto, but also for other characters and situations. It seems that the more important the character is, the less the character develops. The only development you see is an increase in abilities and power, but with such a cast of characters so much more could have been done. Thusly, Naruto is a show of wasted opportunities and weak character development. 2: Very slow pace There are large parts of the show where the last part of the previous episode makes up the first part of the following! Seriously! This means that during that time you will LITERALLY not miss a single frame of animation if you skip every second episode. Also, some battles are so drawn out that you almost expect the participants to drop dead from old age, or at least hunger. Picking up the pace at most places would have helped the show immensely. 3: Fillers The dreaded fillers, episodes that do not follow the main storyline but show adventures apart from it. They have been handled well in many shows, but in Naruto it seems that almost every filler was written by someone who doesn't like writing stories. There are a few gems to be had, but for the most part they're boring and irrelevant. Fillers can help develop the characters, but this just doesn't happen in Naruto. In conclusion, Naruto can be very good and very enjoyable at times, but finding those gems means watching a whole lot of boring and repetitive stuff. A shortened version with only the good parts included would make it a much better series.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 16, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_811ded73c3,5,1776
"Naruto: More Than Just a Classic. When we talk about anime and the greatest works in its history, it’s impossible not to think of Naruto. This incredible shōnen has been the starting point for many of us in the world of anime, and that’s why it holds a special place in our hearts. Its story is gripping and exciting. Even with filler episodes, it manages to stay entertaining and keeps you wanting more. The characters are diverse—some are well-developed, others not so much—but it’s almost guaranteed that one of them will become your favorite. In my case, it was Gaara. The animation, while not on par with today’s modern productions, is still beautiful and expressive in its own right. The soundtrack is simply wonderful. Every piece fits the scene perfectly—whether it’s a battle, a sad moment, or an emotional one. It’s flawless. In conclusion: if you haven’t watched it yet (which I doubt), you’re missing out on a masterpiece. Watch it—you won’t regret it.

"People seem to dickride this show in recent reviews so lets talk about it. WARNING, this review will almost definitely contain spoilers. Im not covering the whole show, just the 220 episodes of the naruto, which means i'll be excluding shippuden. So naruto starts of the series by basically being an asshole bratty kid and basically says to everyone, ""you cant do the things i do, im the main character, im better than you"" The show always tries to preach to you and emphasize the lesson that even if you aren't born with amazing gifts, hardwork can always make up for it. Let's mainly focus and talk about the Neji vs Naruto fight during the chunin exams. Lets first establish the two characters, Neji and Naruto are mirrors in this instance. First lets talk about naruto, but which naruto? There's a lot of fuckin naruto's in this series. Obito is a naruto, Jiraiya is a naruto, Tsunade's stupid little brother is a naruto, Tsunade's supposed boyfriend is a naruto, Kiba's a naruto, Hashirama is a naruto, Sai's brother is a naruto... It seems like EVERYONE at this point is a naruto, TOO many naruto's. But lets talk about my most favourite naruto of them all, no its not naruto, its Iruka Sensei, the most useless and unimportant character in the series. This guy made a big deal about caring for naruto at the start of the series when everyone hates him because they're so similar, his parents died when this big fox that lives in naruto's anus, or spinal cord, i dont really know where. But this fox ate their house or something and munched on his parents, damn that's quite rough buddy. So Iruka Sensei grew up without parents and he also was stupid. So to get attention he acted like an idiot, when really he actually is. So he's like, hey naruto *while crying*, you also are an idiot and your parents are dead like mine, so i'll teach you how to fail and be useless in the ninja world life like me, and he really did try to do that. Unfortunately for him though, naruto ends up becoming a living god that fights a living god that basically gave birth and created the whole shinobi/human race in naruto. He fought a tree from the moon with an eye with 10 tails or something, idc. But what's Iruka sensei doing by the end of the series? Nothing, just jerking it, no wife, no nothing, no advancements in his career as a teacher or a ninja either. He's just busting nuts against the wall until he dies alone in minimum wage. Why? because unlike naruto who is ACTUALLY VERY TALENTED and has a lot of shit going for him that this guy(iruka) will NEVER have. This guy is naruto if naruto wasn't a talented hypocrite who yells hardwork all the time when really he never worked hard at all. The series makes a big deal at showing how talented and privileged naruto really is. They bestow upon him and spoon feed him on a silver platter many gifts. The first of them is 9 tails from sonic that lives in his ball sack or something. Since its a japanese anime they have something called chakra which they act like its physical stamina but really its not and its just magic points that allows you to do magic tricks that you can kill people with and cause big magic explosions without having to make am actual bomb or something. So, tails the big red fox has ALOT of magic points, LIKE ALOT and when Naruto runs out of magic when he does stupid and pointless shit during the so called tactical fights which he usually does tails the big red fox do will give him more! How much more? just however much the plot needs. Heck at this point its like pokemon when the animal wins the match for the trainer and everyone is like ""WOW, tHAT tRaINEr sUrE iS sTRoNg!"" even though the trainer didn't do anything. This anime does just that with naruto's fox thats up his anus with magic powers called chakra. Naruto does something stupid and then the fox bails him out and everyone all around naruto is like ""Wow naruto sure is strong and is really good at becoming a magical ninja now, i better believe it!"" Let me give you one example. Our hero naruto is tricked into stealing some secret high level scroll from the secret ninja association library book scroll place and learns the signature move to make shadow clones. Naruto learns to do this and immediately makes 100+ clones after reading the scroll for JUST a few minutes! Are you kidding me?! This is stupid because later on we find out that being able to make just a few of these requires a ton of chakra points. So how did naruto make so many? Fox hax! Shadow clones are apparently some secret technique/magic trick invented by the 2nd hokage and since it was on a forbidden top secret scroll it apparently is some high level technique taught to high level ninja aka Jonin although even kids recognize shadow clones when they see them and other villagers also recognize it when they see it and enemies all over the ninja world ALSO recognize shadow clones to be some kind of mundane trick so i guess its not that secret..? The point is naruto can only do it cuz he's cheating with his talent and fox hax. He later on even gets told that he's garbage at doing it because compared to his teammates, his magic point control is too weak and he wastes too much of it everytime he performs the jutsu/magic spell trick thingy. He's just dumping a bunch of magic points into the trick until it works. Ironically enough, at the start of the series they show that naruto himself doesn't even know what chakra IS??!! He's not only stupid and a cheat, but he also doesn't work hard and never studies. The thing that pisses me off about naruto is that he always repeats and says that he always tries really hard but in reality we never actually see him try or work hard to become a good ninja. Anyways i think im done writing this review, you kind of get the point. Dont watch this anime its a waste of time.

"In this review, I ignore ALL filler episodes, and I strongly recommend that anyone watching this do the same. If I didn't, this anime would get a 6 at best, which does not do justice to the episodes that are faithful to the source material. Naruto has the most intelligent fighting in all of anime, a varied and powerful soundtrack that never fails to compliment the scenes, intriguing villains and likable protagonists, an addictive nature, a semi-realistic art style that noticeably evolves and improves over time, and a satisfying plot, despite being a bit slow. The problem is that all of this is basically there to justify the fight scenes. If those scenes were not there, or if they were not as good as they are, Naruto becomes meh. I would estimate that more than half of Naruto is spent in fighting scenes. This huge dependence on something that, in other anime, merely adds spice to an already awesome package prevents me from ranking this up with the best of the best. On the other hand, those fight scenes are the best I've seen. In particular, characters will set up multi-step plans more or less right before your eyes, without you realizing it. They will then blow you away with the checkmate, and you get an explanation of exactly what they were doing before and why. This makes for intense, thrilling action that culminates in 'OH, SNAP!' climaxes. Intelligence, and not last minute powerups or brute force, wins the day in Naruto. Furthermore, abilities in Naruto always have disadvantages, limitations, or risks, which are made clear to the viewer. There are no random asspulls. Even with those restrictions, abilities are basically always used in unexpected and creative ways. The same trick never works twice. Naruto also knows when a simple, emotionally charged beat down is called for, and delivers them. In summary, Naruto is the Death Note of fighting. If that's what you want, definitely watch this anime.",8,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1583ee57f2,5,1930
"Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are my favorite anime, but i'm going to stick to my guns and give this show an honest review. Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime. Now on to the review :p The animation is good, nothing special but it's not bad at all especially for its time. the voice acting still holds up as spot on emotional at some times performances. This applies for both the Japanese and English dub though i do recommend the English. The story is great, some if not most episodes end in cliffhangers making me want to watch more. The show is well balanced with action and dialogue/story moments. Aside from some crappy fillers, the episodes do a good job building up the story and telling it well. Some fillers are good and fun to watch, while others seem like a complete waste of time. up until the 100's there are hardly any fillers at all and the story stays consistent with build up and excellent storytelling. The story does a good job at showing progression throughout the series, the characters mature and change and the story evolves. When one arc ends, a new one starts keeping its roots to the central story but being different at the same time to not just feel like you're seeing the same thing over again. The characterization is one of the show's best features, as the story goes on, you genuinely start to care about these characters and understand them well. Certain characters are kept mysterious when they need to be, and it's interesting to see their intentions revealed over time. With other character's it's nice to watch some change and mature as the show progresses on. The story isn't full of crazy plot twists or intense action though. However this is only part 1 of the series so it's done like that for obvious reasons i guess. The action at some points is spot on and can be surprising as well, but like i said the show can sometimes lack a real intensity. Basically that's everything, i didn't truly have any gripes with the show, but it's obviously nothing outstanding and perfect. Still Naruto is a great show nonetheless and i'd highly recommend it.

"Alternate viewpoint review: (SPOILERS and REALISM follows) Naruto is a young boy being raised in a Dystopian society where young children are trained to become assassins. The nations of the world sponsor shinobi villages where the self-ran villages each train a significant portion of the populace to become shinobi in the interest of securing income for that village. Naruto grows up in the Village Hidden in the Leaves, the first of the villages founded; and based upon the ""Will of Fire"" philosophy that puts village and the next generation ahead of the individual. They are certainly the ""good guys"" compared to the Mist Village where the children once ritualistically killed each other to achieve adulthood. At the start of the series, Naruto is an orphan who is also social outcast in his own village; for he had a 9-tailed fox (a powerful being who has caused many disasters in the past) placed into him as a baby. Despite this being a village where freakish ""jutsus"" (including infesting your body with parasitic insects, and supernatural abilities of illusion and murder) are the norm, Naruto is shunned for choices he did not make. Motivated to gain respect and acceptance amongst the people (with an absentee Godfather who's off womanizing, he has no support at home), Naruto seeks to become a great ninja and leader of the village. A lousy student, Naruto steals villages secrets to pass his studies and finds himself on a team with his rival Sasuke (an emo boy who only talks about murdering his brother), Sakura (infatuated with Sasuke, because murderous emos who ignore and belittle you are the hot item in this messed up village); and led by Kakashi; a man who lost all his teammates in battle and has been a black ops assassin ever since. The group trains and progresses. Naruto progresses by tapping into the dark forces of the fox and by transforming into a naked, prepubescent girl to gain training from his neglectful godfather (who was supposed to train him to begin with). Sakura relies on passive-aggressive tendencies and is generally useless until much later; despite being a genius. (good moral; Brains are useless, you just need to try hard to get everything) Sasuke relies heavily upon his family's legacy, eyes that allow him to learn jutsus and understand them naturally; that and years of murderous hate. The team faces their first struggle when they learn that the evil Orochimaru, a great former ninja of their village, seeks Sasuke's body. At least they acknowledge something wrong with a man in his 60's proclaiming he needs a pubescent teenagers body. Rather than react to the creepy stalker and take action, they instead go on about business as usual; and the result is a terroristic attack where Orochimaru assassinates the Hokage (the village leader and his former teacher). During this, Naruto squares off against Gaara; another boy who had a monster placed into him. Due to a brutal mindfucking by his own father, Gaara is a homicidal maniac (and unreliable assassin, nice job breaking it Kazekage!) but has his worldview shattered when Naruto proclaims he's fighting for his friends and defeats Gaara. Sure, the fact that Naruto's monster has 9 tails and Gaara's only has 1 (a measurement of power) had nothing to do with it... Naruto then sets out with Pervy Sage (the aforementioned Godfather) to find a woman who should be the next Hokage. The woman is Tsunade, a woman who is a compulsive gambler, frequent drinker, and spends a great deal of power to look over 30 years younger than she is. Apparently these are great leadership qualities in this world! Then, as if to underline Naruto's arguments about the quality of friendship; Sasuke betrays them to run off and join Orochimaru to gain power, ignoring all the people he's killed and is offers his body in exchange for power. Sakura, always the team player, gets Naruto to vow to return Sasuke to the village; a move that puts both their lives at risk. Enforcing the immature, ""treat broads like crap, and they love you"" philosophy at play. Much more happens, but basically Naruto has to deal with the fact that all the people in this world are permanently scarred (raising children to murder...nah, can't have anything to do with it right?) and is able to win people over to brighter point of view by just being a swell guy...or he kills them. Summary: It's actually a great series, but I figure almost everyone who's into anime has seen or heard about this series. I felt it was important to illustrate that this series is VERY disturbing once you get passed the silly Shonen antics.",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1f972c58d4,5,4586
"Naruto is definently not as good as people say it is, the story has been done to death, but most other aspects of the series are good. Story: like previously stated nothing new here, ninja boy reaches to achieve his dreams, has many wacky and serious adventures along the way. Art: The animation for Naruto is good, i would put it above what Shippudden is like right now, the character design isn't really all that different, i mean 5-6 sub-main characters have permanent spiked hair. Sound: The intro themes are some of my favorite, i love Asian Kung Fu generation, and i never really listen to the endings but that doesn't matter, the music they use tends to fit the scenarios, ie.no hard stuff during funny moments, but most anime has decent sound tracks. Character: Like most shonen anime they catch with the characters, and they are all well made. You can find all the different characteristics in this anime, emo, goth(gaara), pervert, blah blah blah i gerantee you will find at least 1 memorable character in Naruto. Because of the easily predictable story line, my enjoyment of the series is lost, half way through all the episodes you can pretty much predict who its gonna end, but its still worth your watch. Overall im giving it an 8 good series if a tad predicatble, but hell its a shit load better than shippudden",8,Recommended,"Apr 8, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2527a3686c,5,1326
"All right, first review on the site, and probably not the last one. I remember that a friend of mine suggested to watch the series, then I started. It wasn't bad, but sometimes I feel it's boring. The Chuunin Exam was pretty good, and that's where I decided to keep on watching the series. Right now I'm watching the Shippuuden, but currently it's on hold until it reaches a point that I found interesting in the manga. *cough* Jiraiyavspain *cough* Some fight scenes are memorable, but they are pretty rare in that many episodes. Talking about many episodes, Naruto might have the slowest story from all the animes I know. Sometimes I wish I would skip some parts, and sometimes I did: like I skipped the whole filler on the end of this series. Now let's talk about the characters. There are characters you can easily like, and characters you can easily hate. I still don't understand why are there so many Sasuke fans, while he's the worst emo I have ever seen. However I like Shikamaru, his fights always has a twist near the end, and I actually liked Lee before his injury. After that: umm, just strange. =) Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad series, but it could be better at some points. Skip the fillers, and have some fun.

"Many watched Naruto as kids and grew up with it. Me on the other hand, I'm one those who discovered this series when it was already done, and I was in my 20s. I had also already watched FMA:B a couple years before. so it wasn't quite my first anime. I was very skeptical of Naruto: its character designs seemed unappealing, and its ninja seemed to have nothing to do with real life ninja. I went into it expecting nothing. I watched the first episode not even knowing about Naruto's true nature. So I was genuinely wowed by that early plot twist. What surprised me most about it was to see a story that at first seemed to just be a show about some troubled kid with a lot yelling suddenly take a turn for something actually quite heavy and and quite heartfelt. It signaled to me that this anime packed something more, and was willing to cover engaging, emotional storylines. It had a heart. The characters of this story are an odd mix. They all start out pretty annoying, and in the first episodes, the main trio of Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura keep bickering nonstop, and all the other kids are very immature as well. This can easily be plainly annoying. Naruto especially took a long while for me to find likable. But while we have these seemingly weaker characters, some well fleshed out antagonists are introduced, and when all things are considered, most of the characters in Naruto follow a pattern of starting out pretty one dimensional but then being built upon through the following arcs, so that by the end of the series, I found them to be quite endearing. The fights are a big part of Naruto, often lasting multiple episodes. They are always very entertaining to watch, with a good element of tension, a wide range of powers showcased and a lot of thought been put in the progression of the fight. The fight also often reflect a mental hurdle or ideological struggle that Naruto faces, which gives them a double value as both exciting and emotional fights. In short, Naruto is a crowd-pleaser. It has those two essential things, emotion and action, and it is effective at conveying both. It wouldn't be a complete review without mentioning the filler. This series (the first part of the whole Naruto saga) is different from its sequel Shippuuden in that for the most part there is no filler intertwined into the canon... instead it is all lumped in the second half of the series. This makes it possible to see the whole series without having to do the incessant episode-skipping that Shippuuden requires.",9,Recommended,"May 29, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f5cb1b679d,5,2513
"This is one of the most high quality anime out there. I mean what more could you want? Although there are some flaws to this anime. Even though the story and plot are amazing, the art seems a bit outdated. Also if your watching on some streaming site like Crunchyroll, there are black bars on the sides which can be irritating at some times. But besides that, Naruto is a great anime overall and one of my personal favourites. You can enjoy this anime with friends and family. Although sometimes the show can get a bit dark and bloody, overall there is nothing too bad.",9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3fe3908c74,6,569
"Ignoring the filler: Naruto is an amazing series. Naruto has a plot that pulls you in, sometimes you have no idea how a fight between 2 people will turn out until the last 30 seconds, sometimes not until the fight has finished. Almost every character in the whole series gets character development and you learn to love everyone for either being: cool, strong, confident or because of how evil they are. You have to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Otherwise you are joining a story right in the middle and nothing will make much sense. The filler can be annoying and it is all not worth watching, you could always come back to it after you have finished the series but first time watchers, I recommend skipping them. I mean come on, they animated the whole story of Part I in the manga up until the very last chapter, then they put 84 filler episodes in a row before animating the final chapter of Part I. Also, don't read the summary for Shippuden until you've finished the original series, I'm so glad that I did not because it completely gives away the ending of original Naruto and will affect how you see characters the first time watching it. If you would like a filler guide and to enjoy the series to its maximum without ruining it with pointless, bland filler, watch these episodes only: 1-25 27-96 98-100 101 is filler but based off of a canon omake (short story). It is funny and the only filler I recommend watching. 107-135 Then the last 11/12 minutes of episode 220. You should know when the canon starts because they replay the final canon scene from episode 135. I hope that people give Naruto a chance and watch it they way you're supposed to, without filler.",9,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ce05f37899,6,1675
"For some reason, every single review I read on MAL looks like they were typed by a person who is about 12 years old, but trying to seem like they are a seasoned writer. I won't be doing that. This is my honest opinion with no attempt to razzle and dazzle you. (Though, I may not be able to help it, as my writing tends to be on the more ""professional"" side because of my profession lol). Anyways! If you haven't watched Naruto yet, GET ON IT. Why should you watch it? I'll tell you why: it's incredible. I am a normal adult male. I am not a self-described ""anime freak,"" though I thoroughly enjoy a ton of anime. This show doesn't feel like your typical anime. This is a show that everybody can enjoy. You get to see the life and progression of a little jackass in a village full of serious ninjas and over time, you begin to see a bit of yourself in Naruto. (At least, I did. I was just like him. Lashing out, being mean to people, and all the while hurting on the inside). But, there is so much more to it. Naruto starts out as a show about this kid that nobody likes but when the show progresses, you learn so much about him. You learn why he acts the way he does and you begin to feel for him. You want to reach out and tell him ""everything will be ok."" However, there is no need for that. The sheer optimism of this kid fills you up with hope and joy. By the end of the series, he had fulfilled his goal to become Hokage and he is one of, if not THE, strongest ninja in the world. When its over, you realize, I have grown up with this kid. It makes you think why you aren't doing better in your own life. Believe it, achieve it. Signing off folks.",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3efa08c0cd,6,1652
"Naruto is really typical, it seems like one of those infamous series you hear about all the time, so you tend to watch it to satisfy your own curiosity. It's not as bad as some people claim, yet I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever watched. Story: Here's the thing with the story of Naruto, it's really a good plot, it is, minus the fillers that is. Once the fillers kick in, the whole enjoyment aspect of it just fully decreases. I'm rating the story aspect of it based on the story itself, not the fillers, hence why I said it was very good. The rating for this anime would really improve if they did it in seasons. Sure, the thought of waiting months for the next arc is a bit frustrating, but at least the fans would get something worth watching. Art: Nothing really to say about art, it's really typical so I wouldn't say it stands out. Sound: Most of the opening and closing seem to fit appropriately with the genre of the anime, same goes for the background music used in the anime. Character's voice all fit nicely with their respectively characters, which helps to bring out their unique personality. Characters: The characters themselves are average, like most series, they all tend to wear the same clothes all the time, probably to better acquaint you with them. What I'd like to comment about is the use of skills, at first you see their unique skills and you find it really exciting, but some of them are really getting overused (Naruto's Rasengan), this again, leads back to the fillers. If there were less fillers, their wouldn't be a need to do such a thing and fans wouldn't get so sick of seeing the same skills over and over again. Enjoyment: I did enjoy it, but you have to look at it as a whole, which means in the presence of the fillers, in which case my enjoyment decreased as each episode goes by and getting frustrated at seeing Naruto's Rasengan for the billionth time really didn't help either. Overall: A good anime consists of many different aspects, each must come together nicely for the series to be successful and for a good rating. Naruto lacks in some areas, and no surprise, the ratings are what it is. I'd still recommend it to those who wishes to enjoy all anime like I do, but for those easily frustrated by long series, this is not for you.",7,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ff60e24228,6,2284
"Naruto is truly a special anime that flourishes in heart, intrigue, originality, and emotional impact. This review is only for the canon episode 1-135. The original Naruto, meaning the pre-timeskip story, has earned its place among the very best of the shonen battle genre in my book. Every single-story arc brings a unique storyline that is filled with emotional, suspenseful, and epic moments and builds on the world and characters of Naruto. The world of Naruto is filled with originality and detail. The lore of the villages, the clans, various jutsus, and many other detailed systems give you great insight into the complexity of this world. The story will show you the harsh and sad nature of the ninja world, and how it has affected the people who live through it. Naruto’s story is not only exciting and emotional, it also has a lot of thematic depth. Ideas of loneliness, failure, pain, hate, genocide, social class systems, revenge, and many more are explored through this story. Kishimoto's ability to not only write compelling main characters, but also write an assortment compelling side characters is one of the underrated aspects of the Naruto series. This anime is filled with unique characters that have so much to offer down to the nuanced side characters. Seeing how our protagonist and his friends/rivals develop over the course of these 135 episodes is amazing, and specifically between Naruto and Sasuke is one of the best examples of a compelling relationship and parallel in all of anime. The deep emotional impact of Naruto is well-known, and I will completely agree this this story will tug at your heartstrings. In the shonen battle genre, I can think of no other anime that even rivals it in this regard aside from One Piece. Another skill of Kishimoto’s is his well written backstories for his characters. There are numerous backstories for both primary and secondary characters that are made with such care and passion that you come to understand these characters in a way that most anime don’t achieve. It also mixes some comedy elements at the right times that are genuinely funny, and dont feel overbearing like many other shonen. The final point of excellence that most recognize is that it has exciting and strategic action. It contains many of the most incredible and iconic fight scenes in all of anime that contain intricate plans and cool abilities. Naruto is the definitive king of hype when it comes to anime. There is no other anime I know that pulls off epic moments of overcoming obstacles, suspense, coolness, and achieving something great. It's a very fun series, and I think it balances all of its aspects well to show originally what makes a great shounen battle series. Its multifaceted and excels in nearly all areas. The canon story is contained in episodes 1-135 which are the only episode I recommend you watch from the original Naruto anime, unless you are interested in filler. Once again, Naruto is very special to me. I think is deserves more respect as a great work in the anime community; its not just a mainstream surface level anime. It an excellent anime that offers so much, and is fully rewarding to experience.",10,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b2fc826dde,6,3175
"This was my gateway series. I had watched a lot of anime in the mid 90's but gave it up completely. I reluctantly started this series thanks to a persistent friend. This is the first part of the Naruto Manga (up until the time skip for his 2+ years of training). This is one of those anime that is difficult to turn off because it's just so good. This is yet another series that has established itself as a timeless classic right up there with Dragonball. The violent world of the ninja in this series is filled with surprisingly rich characters. There is a lot of comedy and a lot of drama. This series takes you through a full range of emotions, and the psychology of the battles that these 12 and 13 year old kids endure is amazing. The battles are clever and not necessarily done in real time so you can gain insight into how each character handles the situations move by move. The graphic and violent nature of this series makes it a crime that the english dubs target younger audiences. One of the biggest themes in this series is comradery. Naruto is an orphan that is hated by his village due to the incident surrounding his birth. He has to form bonds with others pretty much by overcoming one hardship after another. He earns his friendships through blood, sweat, and tears. The respect he gains is admirable, and he seems to do it while being a little slow on the uptake. The overall message remains heartwarming throughout. The message really is a good one. If you must watch this series I advise picking up the ""uncut"" version. The last couple of seasons are almost 100% filler, so I do advise watching this filler free. The story from the Manga is adapted very well if you skip over the filler. I know some would argue that point with me, but it stays close to the Manga without filler, and the manga is a near masterpiece.",9,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_fd3595139b,6,1837
"Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. The story takes place in a world where ninjas are very powerful and are a valuable and necessary government resource. The story centers around a young, ambitious, over-zealous boy named Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto dreams of becoming a very strong, formidable ninja and one day The Hokage (The leader of Naruto’s village. The Hokage must be, if not one of, the most powerful ninjas in the village). However Naruto is ostracized because of the fact that inside him is the nine-tailed fox spirit that was sealed inside of him after it attacked the village and killed many ninjas around the time of Naruto’s birth. Upsides Naruto is one of the most famous and most popular animes of all time and it deserves the hype. Naruto is filled with many intense, dramatic battle scenes against enemy ninjas and has many likeable charismatic characters that you are guaranteed to fall in love with. Furthermore, Naruto has an always interesting, ever-changing storyline that goes far beyond fight scenes i.e., Naruto’s love/hate relationship with Sasuke who is a naturally gifted ninja that is always pushing Naruto to do better. Naruto and co. also offer a substantial amount of humour to go along with the stellar action and spectacular story. Downsides There aren’t many downsides to Naruto. That being said, there are some. One of the most prominent flaws being the slow pace, for example, the fist arc which really isn’t much more than an introduction to the main characters lasts about 15 episodes. A big, but avoidable problem is the number of fillers. Alost 90 of the 220 episodes have no relevance to story are frankly, garbage. Luckily, thanks to the wonderful resource that is the internet, one can easily find which episodes are fillers and subsequently, skip them. But if you are a hard core Naruto fan and sitting through hours of episodes that have nothing to do with the story, there is nothing wrong with that. At first glance, the young ages of most of the main characters may turn a few people away. It never actually states how old Naruto is but he appears to be about 10ish. But it really is irrelevant.

"I used to like this series. I used to enjoy it. Not anymore. This series does not age well. I found the apex of the series to be the Chunnin Exams and the very moment that Naruto decks out Gaara was probably one of the better moments showing the differences between the two. But now, looking back....it wasn't worth the time. Some of my favorite series have less episodes to work with and tell more interesting stories. Some of my favorite series have less plot, but are a lot more enjoyable. And some of my favorite series run less than the amount of filler episodes in this series. Overall, I lost interest. I still like a couple of the characters. But I've outgrown the series. Naruto himself as a character stopped being interesting and was turning into the whinny little kid type I found throughout the series. Sakura is just useless and Sasuke reminds me of a slow and way dialed up emo Hiei from Yu Yu Hakusho. This series is a cash cow, it was fun at the time, but now it's run it's course and doesn't age well. A lot of the series development is either pointless or easy to see from miles ahead.

"In a lot of ways, Naruto is better than its sequel, Shipuuden. The power levels are tame so there is less of ""throw explosive lasers at each other until one side wins."" Naruto is also characterized in a more interesting way than his Shipuuden version. He's a cheeky prankster which makes for an entertaining and endearing main character. I know that he had to grow up, but that's just a shame. Despite being a fan of the series, partly through nostalgia and partly through appreciation, I think some parts don't stand the test of time. The animation in most of the show hasn't aged well. It's inconsistent and even feels choppy at some points. There's also the aspect of people staring at each other for too long, padding the runtime. The yapping is cheesy a lot of the time. The villains aren't characterized in an interesting way (in this part at least). Also, the bulk of the story doesn't happen here, making this a really long introduction. Obvious advice: Don't watch the filler.

"To say that I was bored when I typed Naruto into Youtube would be a little understated. I have been watching Keroro Gunso For a whole week, my computer was just fixed( watched Keroro Gunso on the PS3 web browser), and I have no real friends would make me completely bored out of my skull when I typed in Naruto…even though I never regretted it. Naruto follows the plot of every single Shonen to date. A Young man has something that no one else has, he begins to use the thing to fight his way to the top of his imaginary society, and he will be fighting off against his best friend or family members soon. In this Anime’s Case, Naruto has a demon, he uses it’s chakra(spiritual energy if I am right) to get his way to become the leader(Hokage) of his Ninja Village. While watching the first episode, I was honestly surprised to find the Japanese voices to be a bit annoying, so I switched to the Dubbed version and even was more surprised to find I actually liked it. The voices fit the characters well(But some of the characters sound a little too old for their age) and the script wasn’t half bad and it wasn’t censored so much that to explain the dead bodies, they say their ‘sleeping’. The storyline is pretty much standard, but it picks up enough after the first story arc and I get pulled in after the rookie 9 meet for the first time. That takes…20 episodes. You might be asking why I stayed in that long if the story was standard fare. And I will say because the characters are incredibly easy to relate to and even easier to like, if not love. Naruto is pretty interesting as a main character in his own little way, and Sasuke can probably make all the girls in the world rise up and cheer if he just kisses Naruto again, and Sakura…well…doesn’t do anything but otherwise she stays out of the way most of the time and is interesting in her own way. The other main character is Kakashi, the most kickass teacher in the whole F’in world. He is mysterious and yet not moody, He is incredibly powerful but not arrogant, he has a great sense of humor without trying too hard. In fact, You could have given the entire series to Kakashi and he would probably have the same(if not better) success as naruto. The supporting characters are just as good, and all of them have a great back story and deserve to have the praise and fan fiction they get and more. But every series has it’s downfalls for people…and for some it’s worth not watching a great anime. The first problem(complaint) is that Naruto is filled with Fillers. And I honestly say that the popularity of Naruto thrives on Fillers. To point out why I think that, lets compare two animes that are known for Fillers. Dragon Ball Z A huge fight at the beginning…and then we wait the entire season for at least something like that to happen again. Meanwhile, We get to train! And Train some more! And we get to watch Goku learn two boring moves and when he finally uses them, they are nothing but wimpy when used on the two enemies where only ONE was damaged. Naruto The Fillers show more of the character themselves and I can’t distinguish one filler episode from just a regular one. Naruto has fillers filled with character development that I love and cherish(Except for that kid in episode 2, I smiled when he cried at the Hokage funeral =) ) The Second problem is that Naruto has stereotypical characters. I admit, many of the characters that Fans like all have some sort of troubled past or they watched their entire village get slaughtered(WINK). But Yet again, I am not picky and all the characters are stereotypical in a way that isn’t obvious as some other animes. The Third problem is that Naruto is copying off from other anime, which I find silly because Anime is always the same really. In fact, most of the anime you find will look incredibly similar story wise. But Anime is special in that the characters are always new and fresh and can easily be related to. Naruto is no exception. The Fourth and final problem is the flashbacks, and I honestly can say that you will get a flashback about every 5 to 10 minutes! And the flashbacks always focus on what happened in the last episode. There is a point where we already have gotten five different aknoledgments from the characters of what happened, we need a flashback on what just happened. In short, Naruto is a anime that you will enjoy if you are open minded and want something new. You won’t like it if your complaining about the characters jumpsuit and you don't like Ninjas. That means your a Pirate guy right?",8,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0a772de120,6,4540
"Naruto is amazingly awesome. Until you get to the part that is completely overrun by filler. Everything besides the filler of this show is truly good. The story is well-designed, the art, sound effects, and music are all very high quality. The show really shines in terms of characters, featuring many characters who all express pretty good development. The story does kinda span over what seems like too many episodes, but for the most part it does deliver high quality action and character interaction very effectively. Well, until you get to the non-canon filler. Despite the fairly low rating I'm giving this anime, I must stress that several of the most impressive moments in anime history do occur here. Character interaction at some points has never been better, and depending on the type of person you are, this anime does have the potential to bring tears to your eyes as your mind is blown away by what could be the most appropriate ending to the best fight scene you may have seen in your entire life.

"I will repeat something that has already been said in other reviews: Naruto is the most overrated anime in history. Yes, but I will be honest in my analysis. Story: Nothing to complain about, it could have been better, but it manages to be attractive and cool. Art: I am not exaggerating, after all this is one of the few positive points that I see in the work as a whole: Art. There are characters with very beautiful features, of course, nothing complex and superior to other works, but analyzing Naruto separately, this is perhaps the only point worthy of a good note. Sound Production: I think for a lengthy anime, repeating the same soundtrack may be a bit overloaded, but I can not say that OST's are bad, on the contrary, they are always well-matched. Nothing complex, nothing out of the ordinary. Characters: The reason for my 10th note to the characters is due to something that you will only understand if you watch the sequel: Naruto has good characters, and for an extensive work, he deserves admiration for not forgetting several characters. The characters are well spent, fun, charismatic and developed. In the final arc, we have the use of several characters that needed to be developed, and they end up being: Neji, Shikamaru, and others. Besides the lack of protagonism shounen in that part. Enjoyment: Despite being a good work (note 8), it does not captivate much from one episode to another, ends up curling up in some parts, which discourages watching, but still worth it. Overall: 8-This part of manga adapted in anime, deserves that note. It is not a very original shounen, the end is open for continuation, there are good characters that are used, and a work that, however it is not my favorite, is a good work! I do not recommend the continuation, since almost everything I mentioned here is reversed in the continuation.",8,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_33fc665a3f,6,1846
"This is one of some shows I really don't know why is so successful. I can only guess why: It was one of the few animes transmitted on the TV with an easy way to watch. I guess this because of it was the very situation on my country down to the last decades, so I think this is the overall situation. If you drink some soda, listen to some song or play some video-game, how do you know these things are good or not? Exactly, comparing with other products of the same type. If you have no others products to compare, you will probably find anything great, because it's a pure type of innovation in your life. I'm almost sure it was the reason Naruto became so popular. Naruto is just one of the many commercial crap released with no clue of creativity, if you watch like, Hunter x Hunter before it, you'll easily note the elements recycled to that. Took as example the main character: a good smiley pre-teenage boy with a big dream, how cares a lot about the people around him and is kinda of an idiot. Then you have a cool-head fellow with a serious expression and a dark past. OK, it already is a very big resemblance, but does it end here, right? Nope. Although it does end in the main characters, you'll see many others resemblances in others characters, like antagonists, tutors, aged men, etc. You may think ""resemblances are natural in those types of work because the authors have inspiration and hall"" wait, it doesn't end here, only in the characters, despite we getting two exactly looking characters at the very beginning, it has already to many others ""resemblances"", as we say. What about the routes the plot takes? Our brave kids go trough a lot of ""similarities"" in a way it's kinda of very scary. We got to see them going to doing a time-limited test to take an object from an obviously stronger adult; we got to see them doing an exam to graduate to the job they need to, which you'll see them passing through quest-based games, individual fightings and a time-limited contest that you need to get some objects from other competitors, then get out of the demarcated area, that has some extravagant animals besides the other competitors who will make your objective very much difficult. Although, not everything is the same. Naruto also tries to discern in some cases, but then we get some horrible things: the author tries to write deep characters, I know it, but the think is he don't know how to do it, the maximum he could do was putting distinct characteristics at unidimensional buildings. It's not an horrible move, in fact, is one of the most things shounen writers do. The horrible thing about it is the constant need to rub that in our faces. WE ALREADY KNOW HOW MUCH NARUTO SUFFERED, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW HATRED SASUKE IS, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW DETERMINED LEE IS BESIDES OF NOT HAVING NINJUTSU, DAMN. Another horrible thing about the show is how lazy Kishimoto tries to settle the conflitcs up: it's just: fighting, fighting, more fighting, Naruto crying about it's past, fighting, Naruto gaining a lot of power from the legendary creature inside of him to win the fight, ok, this over, everyone happy now. Summing up: this show is a huge caught in the hurricane plot with no creativity at most part, and when tries to create something original, it ends up boring, repetitive, painful to watch and a pure waste of time.",2,Not Recommended,"Aug 6, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b5b4eaab7a,6,3341
This is the second anime I ever watched and going into it I didn't think I would like it. There were a few rough spots here and there like flashbacks (I almost quiet it because of them) but the characters and storyline definitely make up for that. The characters that the show had overall made the show even better because all characters had unique designs and powers and I really enjoyed learning about them all. Many people criticise this brilliant show because of the amount of filler it has but that is easily avoidable if you just skip it as it has no real importance to the story. Animation was a bit rough in some parts but in defence of Studio Pierrot there budget was quite small when they started animating it. This show definitely lives up to its hype and that's why I've given it a 9.,9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0536402eda,6,796
"This is one of my favorite animes that I've ever watched and obviously to be considered one of the big three of anime. Characters: All the Characters of Naruto I love because they all are different from one another my favorite characters are obviously Naruto, Rock Lee, Shikamaru, and Neji. Just these characters alone show how great the show is also not only that the villains in this show like Itachi have in-depth storytelling that is fantastic. Story: The story itself is great following the boy Naruto Uzumaki on trying to be the next Hokage and the arcs in this show are amazing and are great storytelling. my favorites include the village hidden in the mist, the chunin exam, and the Sasuke retrieval team. these in my opinion were the greatest arcs in the show. Art: The animation for this anime was incredible especially for the fight scenes blew me away with how well it was executed and the fights themselves kept you on edge sometimes and you never knew what could happen especially in the Chunin Exams. Overall: I love this anime and highly recommend anyone this anime who wants to start getting into anime.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4819b4a5c7,6,1120
"Naruto means a lot to me, it was a big part of my childhood but here is where i put my personal feelings a side and review it from an objective standpoint. The story of Naruto is a bit uneven. On one hand it brings some spectacular and great emotional moments but is brought down by the poor pacing and a lot of fillers. There are episodes with great character development, episodes with spectacle, episodes where nothing happens, episodes with turtle pacing and episodes that have fight scenes that never end. The art and animation is alright. Since it is a 220 episode anime the animation budget for each individual episode is not equal. Some episodes look great others dont. The soundtrack is really good. It builds up the action and gets me pumped every time. The dub is an okay dub that gets the job done but you are not missing anything. The characters are the best thing about Naruto. They are well developed, deep and very well written. They feel human. However the antagonists(excluding Zabuza and Haku) are a bit shallow, while pretty cool looking overall not much to say about them. For my enjoyment i can say when its good its GOOD. The chunin exam arc is the best example of this but the fights some times go on forever and filler nightmares dont help that either. Overall Naruto is an enjoyable anime. Is it good? Yes. Is it flawed? Yes. Is it worth the hype? NO! Is it worth watching? Only if you are ready to sit through 220 uneven episodes and thats not counting shippuden.",7,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_450357831a,6,1490

"Naruto is my first anime and is one of the most popular animes out there after it's sequel Naruto: Shippuden. Story was for me very enjoyable and fun. I like how they mixed up school and missions and got awesome storyline for everybody to like. Everything is about friendship, success in becoming a great ninja and honor. Once again story was very well done and I would not change a thing in it :D Art in Naruto is very simplistic, colorful with bright themes and even the ''scary parts'' look that way. You can see good artwork in detailed backgrounds but not in characters...yes they are noticeable in different ways, but not overdetailed as in some animes. Sounds I liked very much...I can say that the soundtracks did a lot for me and my enjoyment in anime. They go well with all scenes and characteristics; happy, funny, sad, agressive etc. There are some soundtracks with flute and shamisen that I enjoyed the most, so I always get goose-bumps when I hear that kind of music in Naruto =) The most important part that makes Naruto what it is are characters. Each different from other by looks, color, clothing, talk, ninja ranks, abilities and skills. They each have their own background story that helps the main storyline. They're all awesomely done and if you don't like anything else, you'll like the characters. I think I already talked about my enjoyment, so I'll just say this; yes, Naruto is maybe little overhiped, but no one should get in anime with a lot of expectations and I guess it's not the best anime ever (for me it is), but it's definitely worth watching =)",10,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1035c5d87b,7,1581
"Naruto is one of those animes that almost everyone knows about. It's so well known, that only in my country, it streamed in 5 different channels the entire first season. If you ask me to describe naruto with one word, it would be : COOL. Yeah this anime is cool. It's not so epic/dramatic/funny as other animes are, but for sure it is cool. What do i mean? Well i just loved the plot.. and for young teenagers, or even for more advanced ages, this anime can make you on the edge of your sit. Plot: 10/10. This is it. This plot is something amazing. I can´t think about Naruto without thinking about a web. Yes a web. There is just so many things to explore, that when you start thinking about it, you get amazed. I watched this anime 4 years ago, and i still find it unbelievable. The originality is astonishing. I mean .. this is not just ninjas .. there is bunch of things that makes this anime so big in terms of content. What really impressed me, is the variety of powers. Here, on Naruto, you have a thing called ""Chakra"". You born with it. It's like your source of energy to use special skills. Then, depending on the person, the chakra can evolve up to 5 different types of chakra. For each type, there is tons and tons of abilities. Plus, there are special powers, that only some have, are transmited via DNA so only members of that clan can unlock those powers and you also have tons of different clans, so you have really a lot of things to look at. While in some animes you get bored because the plot ends up to be the same thing.. here such thing does not happen. There is just to many different types of skills that you will never get tired. There is always something to new to be shown. Plus, it's not just about skills and how many there are. It's also about the entire background story. The anime starts by telling that once existed a demon nine-tailed fox that attacked konoha(our main village), and moves 12 years later, and the journey begins. The plot at first. is simple and nothing great.. but with time, new things will be added, new characters will be introduced. Besides One Piece, this anime has the biggest cast i've ever seen. But unlike One Piece, when everything is forgotten at some point, here they are introduced and they stick with us until the end. When you realize the size of this plot .. well for me it's always a pleasure thinking about this anime. Nothing here is forgotten. Everything has a reason, everything has a explanation, and at Naruto Shipudden, you will realize how everything was connected since the beginning. They always move back and foward, so they really don´t stick with a time line. They often explore things deep into the past and by doing that, they always introduce new characters and new misteries to solve. It is really an impressive plot. Art: 7/10. Well this anime is old, so either the background and the character design is not the best out there. Even though the animations are pretty well done for it's time. I really enjoyed the action despite of it's lack of detail. So i guess they didn´t failed that hard. The character design makes every single character unique, which for me is nice since there are animes out there were between the chracters, only the hair colour changes. And of course, this is a shonen so fan service takes place every once in a while. Personally i don´t dislike fan service, but for who does not like that, don´t worry. There isn´t to much. Sound: 9/10. The sound is engaging. It draws us into the action, which is such a nice feeling. Every single opening is well done. For the spirit os this anime (spirit of adventure) the openings are truly amazing. The tracks used are also great. They fit with the action, and they add something more to it. I would even say, the tracks used make this anime a litle bit epic when it comes to action. But well that is just my opinion. Anyways, i watched this anime 4 years ago and i still remember the openings and some tracks. So i guess they are memorable and so they are good. Character: 8/10. Well for a shonen .. we can not expect more. Pretty much standard characters. But take in mind. this anime was made almost 20 years ago, so back then, the cliche protogonist could not be so cliche as it is now.. Anyways the characters are enjoyable and almost all of them get a decent develop. It only fails when it comes to personalty and reactions. Unlike the plot, the characters are not that original, at least considering that nowadays they all are clichê. Enjoyment: 8/10. If there is one big problem .. is the comedy. Makes this show so childish and only breaks up the mood. The comedy is nothing more than stupid comedy, so it could be deleted from the anime that you wouldn´t miss it. Plus the last 2 or 3 arcs of this anime are fillers. I can´t ignore that. I didn´t watched it but they are there. I've only watched one arc, and it was so boring omfg .. The rest .. it's fucking amazing. I watched every single episode with a smile on my face of pleasure. Really enjoyable.. This show does not have an end.. it has a cliffhanger end to conect it with it's sequel, Naruto Shipudden. Overall: 8/10. Well i reccomend it ! I don´t give a crap about Naruto Shipudden, this show by it self is amazing and deserves a chance. You can skip and you may skip the fillers because they are useless. This show is a nice shonen, one of the best !",8,Recommended,"Mar 15, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d6fbcd71b8,7,5372
"Naruto is an incredible anime, which gets the audience to constantly invest emotionally. Some fans even believe that it is the best anime in all of history. But as cool as Naruto is, it has one major flaw. The moral of the story is inconsistent. The creator wanted to inspire people into believing that hard work would always overcome talent. But this is contradictory to how the story really shapes out, because the main character- Naruto, is handed things, and doesn’t really work hard for it. When Naruto is born his parents die and is left alone in the world. The village hates him for some reason as he is growing up and everyone tries to stay away from him. He is also really dumb. He is the worst student at his Ninja Academy, and is very bad at everything. He truly is the lowest someone can start at. The story keeps on depicting Naruto as the underdog who worked hard for everything and wasn’t born with any talent. That is a complete lie as the story goes forward. For example, both his parents were legendary ninja, so he got their powers which already sets him apart from the rest of his village, and gives him a huge upper hand. Also he is given extra power, because he has the nine tailed fox inside of him. That makes him not only stronger and more advantaged than the kids his age, but also many adult ninja around the world. Naruto didn’t really have to train to get powerful, he just had to activate his existing power in order to become the strongest ninja, and fulfill his dreams. Naruto was a great show, but because of the fact that there is a huge plot hole, it deserves to get two stars. If the main moral of the story isn’t consistent, then what’s the point of the story? The whole story is shaped around the fact that Naruto started from nothing, and he got all the way to the top. The creators wanted to inspire young kids into believing that they too could become and do anything they want if they worked hard for it. While that is a wonderful message, it is meaningless, if you have to give the main character of the story, so many advantages in order for him to succeed.",10,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_95ecbed846,7,2101
"Finished this a while ago, but I really wanted it to have a place in my blog because it really deserves it&hellip;. What an amazing long running series! I truly liked how the characters developed over time through all the events that occur. The action&hellip; AMAZING! The choregraphy that&rsquo;s done is great and well thought out, so every moment of the anime you can appreciate the art and hard work that is being shown right in front of you. Of course, I always watch my anime SUBBED because I want to avoid Dubs as much as possible as it personally feels like it ruins the original work as it revamps anime as cartoons for children. So I gladly get to dodge all of the &ldquo;Believe its!&rdquo; getting to enjoy the anime much more. The only thing that was an obstacle for me was the pacing of FLASHBACKS. It really bugged me that in the middle of the intensity of a fight they break off to a flashback to explain a character&rsquo;s motive for fighting or whatnot. Towards the end, the pacing becomes an amazing story arc leading up to the present &ldquo;Shippuden&rdquo; series, where the flashback sequences are appropriately placed for correct pacing which makes me feel better in the long run. Naruto is a strange character, yet his morales and drive as a young genin makes you want to root for him, so I became really drawn in to follow his journey until the end.

I imagined Naruto's to be more hyperactive, Hinata's less whispery, Sasuke's less mature....The Manga was an absolute masterpiece by Kishimoto and the Anime totally ruined Naruto's reputation. The first opening theme as you all know is crap, consists mostly of shouting than singing. I can understand why everyone hates Naruto. I did too as I read to Manga first and place so much HOPE that Naruto will be a success. The manga was so much better than the anime, there was more detail and everything was from the imgination and genius of Kishimoto. I thought the anime was created by martins at the lack of genius.

Honestly i believe that it is probably my favorite anime including Naruto Shipuden - that i obviously won't say anything thing about, because this is about part 1. Naruto is a very happy anime and very fun to watch because it is so fun. Story: Honestly, i love the story line, it focuses on Naruto, who because he is the Nine-tails jenjurici, gets despised by the whole village. I know that this is moving to some people, because they can relate to his feelings that are shown in the anime. Naruto then gets put on a team with characters: Kakashi, Sasuke and Sakura. We find out that Sasuke has a goal to revive his slaughtered clan and kill someone. This gives alot of tension, because we know that Sasuke has alot of hatred and we want to know why. Art: Not much to say really, as this was make in 2002, you shouldn't expect the same stuff that you see in more recent anime. though I love how they all look. <3 Sound: The same, not reallly much to say.

"Naruto... What can I say? Next to pokemon, Naruto is a classic. Especially for people who grew up watching it. Now I don't do reviews often so take that in to consideration while you're reading this Naruto is set in a fictional world where ninja roam the land and use techniques called 'jutsu' to amplify their performance. To do this ninja need chakara (similar to kainin DBZ) which is basically their life's essence. Everyone has it, but ninja know how to harness it. Story:10 Naruto is a story about a boy with the same name. The story centers around him and hos friends. As it progresses you see everyone maturing and getting stronger as well as bonds deepening. Yhe story is brilliantly complied into it's own arcs, with fillers being in its own arc. You will see rulers rise and fall. Enemies and organizations Being destroyed or created. And all this is happening to a growimg ninja boy Art: 7 The art was very unique in some episodes. However, you'll mostly see the same kind of background and clothing in the anime. There isn't too much diversity, but when there is, it's extravagant. Just get used to the sight of either a forest, rocky or barren terrain as the fight scenes have all of them sound: 9 The sounds as well as the music were all amazing. You hear some repeats from there but everything was great. From the dialogue, to the intro and outro music, to the sound effects of the fighting! The sounds definitely make this anime that much more amazing Character: 10 Each and (almost) every character is improved upon. Even Sakura herself yes. Those who don't need improvement have wonderfully thought out backstories that are impossible to know NOT know. I can't think of any suggestions when it comes to this Enjoyment: 10 The anime never stops to cease to amaze me. Even after taking a 2-4 year break from it, I came back. Back to the 1st big fight scene between Naruto and Sauske. I wanted to skip fillers and other non-canon episodes so that I can have more time with shippuden. But I couldn't. Thats how enjoyable Naruto is... Final score: 9- Great This anime hit the mainstream market and is praised by many for good reason. It is a one of a kind action comedy anime.

"Naruto is an anime that I would call overrated because you hear more from people hating it then ones who like it. And I think a lot of that is because people want a shows full of mindless violence and flat characters that look cool like DBZ and Bleach. I find Naruto to be much better then either of those. Naruto and One Piece are my favorite Shonen series. What sets Naruto apart, for me, is the world Kishimoto has formed and how every character has his or her own distinct fighting style and personality and dreams and goals. The plot has plenty of twists without becoming complicated and you never have 10+ episodes of fighting one bad guy like in DBZ. Things move at a fast pace most of the time. There are times when it gets boring and the filler is annoying. I just skip it and I am surprised most people just don't look up which episodes are filler and skip them. Simple. Unlike shows like Bleach, Naruto has remained popular in Japan (Bleach being canceled and replaced by a show starring a Naruto side character is proof of that) because it is not the same recycled plot over and over and over and you do really grow to care about the character. Naruto does not deserve all of the hate it gets. I watch a lot of different anime and Naruto is what it is and should be enjoyed as a long running Shonen series with lots of fun for people with an open mind to it. I think people go into every anime expecting a masterpiece and pick them apart for no good reason. Just let go and have fun.

Naruto is popular for a very good reason, but as with anything popular this also leads to haters just for that reason. I believe Naruto shows us many elements of real life. Even re-reading and re-watching it in my 30's I believe it has life lessons that would make the world a better place and myself a better person. Having guts, valuing friendship, banning hatred. I believe some of these are taught in the story in a very strong way. Story: Especially when re-watching I enjoyed the introduction of characters, jutsu and other elements of the narotoverse. To me, everything makes sense and the build-up towards emotional developments, clashes between friends and incremental strength of characters is well thought out. All things introduced, later appear to have been mentioned for a reason. Not in a big announcement kind of way, but very distinctive. Art: Maybe not all of the artwork has the same amount of detail and attention. That being said, some of the scenes featuring hand-to-hand combat are magnificent. For me the artwork is good enough to have some elements in my child's bedroom. Can't be that bad then aye? Sound: No discussion. Intro and outro are continuously good. Changing every 20 episodes or so. But the real winner here is the beautifully matching and emotional music during various scenes. I know they've pushed me over the edge of having some tears every now and then. Simply beautiful. Character: Some characters annoy me. However, Naruto gives you many many options to choose your favourite character from. In addition almost all of them get enough screentime and a fair share of character development. Some, I simply like more than others (Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Shikamaru, Jiraya, Kakashi). Some (Sakura, Ino, Choji, Shino) are a bit shallow. Nevertheless the connection between most of the characters and the briliant development (and backstory) of some of them made me connect with the whole story. Enjoyment: Both the manga and the anime I enjoyed very much. I personally could not get enough of Naruto, so I even enjoyed the filler episodes.",9,Recommended,"Sep 25, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a36cbd8d74,7,2313
"Dattebayo! That's the trademark of one of the most famous anime character, Naruto. Named by some kind of ingredient in ramen. The story is just wow. It's just plain epic! You can see the journey of a boy who is being resent growing up to be a great ninja and become Hokage. All of the conflict, the struggles, tough challenges and emotional elements blended very well. But, it was kind of disappointing when your hero was unable to safe his friend. Anyway, the art of this series was very good. The character was written very well. You can see almost every relevant character got their times to shine and everyone was developed greatly. Moreover, I can relate with most of this characters, which means it was carefully planned. I was enlightened by this story greatly. It gives you so many live lessons. It's not just some cartoon for kids, it's more than that. I called it cartoon before. Overall, I know this story does not perfect. It has it's flaws and not all people can get into it. It contains quite number of fillers too. I recommend you who read this to watch this series if you haven't.",9,Recommended,"Jan 29, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c77a2012c2,7,1096
"Oh boy, Naruto. I remember being really into Naruto as a kid. I started watching it again around February to get into Shippuden. And you know what? I loved it. The anime is amazing. Amazing story and characters, amazing soundtrack, the art is good (nothing too special, just good) and really just enjoyable. The plot twists are good, character development feels natural. I really like how characters don't just get powers for no reason and get super powerful out of nowhere. They develop and train gradually which makes it more believable in a sense. But then, at one point, the anime went into 84 episodes of fillers. Now, now, I know some would say ""Then just don't watch them"" in which case I'd say ""But they are still part of the anime!"" In that case, I'd just read the manga. That has no fillers. Really, before the LONG filler period, I'd have given this anime a 9/10. It was amazing. Not super complicated and a bit cliched but I still think it did its things well. Hell, I was okay with the first 20 fillers or something but they got WAY too much after that. It was torture. Now, the story is good. Non-filler episodes have a pretty good story. As I said, the plot twists can be pretty good. The pacing can be slow, like that episode when they did a recap of all that happened previously for no reason. I'll admit that this anime can make you feel really sad when it wants to and can make you laugh at other times. But not the fillers. There are few good fillers. Those are indeed funny and can even be alright stories. But most of them are so PAINFULLY cliched. They tend to use the exact some plot points we've already seen. The stories repeat themselves and are dreadfully predictable. The whole filler thing ruined how the original anime should have ended. The characters are also pretty good. However, they can be definetely a bit samey to some people as some complain about a lot of them having tragic backstories (like, A LOT). However, it isn't much of a problem for me as I love a lot of the characters personally. There are some that are pretty weak, though, a lot of whom tend to be female characters (Gosh, Ten Ten sucks, that's just what I wanted to say. Sakura as well) Then the fillers screwed that up. Most of those characters follow either one of these patterns: dead parents, monster inside, boy turns out to be a girl etc. It's awful really. Which makes the story just good, as well as the characters. In terms of sound, Naruto is amazing in that regard. I really like the voice acting and the soundtrack is beatiful. There are a few tracks and voice actors who aren't all that great but it's nothing too serious. The art is generally good, considering the time period. It definetely isn't the best nor does it need to be. Overall, Naruto is a good anime. The first half of the anime is amazing, before the whole filler thing started, then it went into crap territory, hence why I had to drop my score by 2 points. That's because there are still some good fillers and the first 20 are bearable and the fact that before them, the anime was amazing (even if they love flashbacks a bit too much).",7,Recommended,"May 27, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7a91b32657,7,3120
"While I do agree that Naruto is the most overhyped anime in history, I can't deny the fact that there is some good in this original series. What made fans like me back then so interested in this anime was the main character himself, Naruto. In some ways a lot of people could identify with Naruto due to the lonely childhood he experianced when everyone in the village hated him for carrying a demon spirit inside him. This makes us feel pity for him, and also sets up his role in the series as the hated underdog who never gives up. Throughout this series Naruto and his friends overcome harsh obstacles in their life after they are first introduced into the dangerous world outside their village. Their vulnerability and inexperience keeps us guessing and curious about how they overcome adversity from their foes, when faced with the battle of life and death. A perfect example of this would be the first arc of this story, The Land of Waves, as they travel on their first A-rank mission. When given the chance to return to the village, Naruto vows to carry on this mission by stabbing his hand after he was poisoned by rogue ninjas. This vow shows us his unwillingness to give in, even when it comes to puting his life on the line. This is the point where we start to admire the character and cheer him on throughout the rest of the story. The same types of character development can also be seen by the other two main role characters, Sasuke and Sakura. (Although after Sakura does develop an arc in this series, she does remain the same pitiful character throughout the rest of the series). Sasuke in particular, was also a character people could care about, because although we do know that he was the most skilled ninja coming out of his class, we also feel his pain and despair when his motivation is introduced later on in the series. Other characters include Hatake Kakashi (the three character's sensei), and the surrounding cast of other ninjas in their class. Kakashi can be a well-liked character because of his past experience and leadership with the three, while the other surrounding cast can be just as likeable when they go through certain arcs in their life and eventually team up with the three main characters when a conflict arises. Another good point that should be mentioned in this series is the music. This, in my opinion, is the most underrated part of this series. Songs like Sound and Strike and Sadness and Sorrow were key in exemplifying the mood in certain action scenes, as well as scenes of sadness. This gets us more involved in the scene and interested in what happens next. Unfortunately what brings this anime down to a 7 is the tedious and mediocre filler arcs that follow after episode 135. Since this anime closely follows the manga, there was a point where the anime eventually caught up, and had to wait for the author to pick up on his story. The result eventually led to the tedious story arcs that ran from episode 136 to 220. These arcs had no relation to the story or the characters as they continued to repeat the same plot elements from the previous arcs before them. Although a lot of us can agree that Naruto Shippuden has taken this series downhill since (which is a darn shame), I do think that people should not overlook the original series, and at least try to watch it whenever they get the chance. There's a reason why it is well liked by many, and should at least be considered before looking at the colossal mess in Shippuden.",7,Recommended,"Nov 20, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6d21004a5d,7,3488
"A lot of people who have not watched Naruto have probably heard of how crap it is or how many fillers there are. WELL. Naruto is probably as mainstream anime as you can get and as much as they drag the story on, I suppose it's quite necessary as they explain every aspect of every character's life. The whole story at first may seem to revolve about the main character, 'naruto', who wants to be the hokage of his village (hokage being the head/most strong ninja of the village), but as you get further into the story there are many minor arcs that involve all the characters. Many moral values are portrayed through the anime such as friendship, betrayal, loyalty, courage and all your typical heroic values. Such as never giving up even though you're spewing blood from your mouth. Though you should probably be prepared for the one fight carrying on for 10+ episodes, normal for any mainstream anime. Overall, 8/10 :)",8,Recommended,"May 26, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ac5b831cdd,7,920
"Wow. I've been following the fandom and hype of this series for about four years now and i haven't managed to think up a review that encompasses the brilliance of Naruto. It's a staple in shounen jump and arguably one of the best animes of all time. All i can say, while avoiding spoilers, is that its a phenomenal series that everyone HAS to check out. If you're new to anime, then its also a great series to start off with. You may not love it immediately but 10 episodes in and you'll be hooked, i promise you that. It's my favourite anime for so many reasons. It just evokes so many feelings in you. You start caring about the characters so much and becoming so absorbed in the plot without even noticing it yourself. The world building is also so believable that it just makes you want to live it, despite the many sacrifices of being a ninja. Every character and every arc teaches you something new, if you only just stop to ponder. The plot is insane. If you haven't read the synopsis, its about about a boy who hosts a demon fox spirit which is shunned by the entire village but is still determined to become hokage(the village leader). Naruto is probably the only series i have watched where every arc is captivating and keeps you on the edge of the seats. The battle sequences are also nicely chereographed and well-thought out. The plot is carefully woven and well-paced so there are no giant gaps between arcs. The so-called ''filler'' episodes are as funny and entertaining as the actual episodes and also contribute to the plot, rather than filling up screentime with mindless laughs, like other animes do. My favourite thing about the series are the characters and their development. Despite having a huge cast, each character is still given his or her moment to shine and no one is left out. Naruto is a great protagonist. He's spirited and stubborn in the best way, refusing to give up on his goals no matter what the setbacks. Sasuke, sakura and kakashi are also well-characterised. Kakashi, in particular, was a character that i found interesting because of his aloofness and mysterious past. That's the best thing about the series. The characters are all so unique. You won't be able to find duplicates of anyone in naruto. Side characters also fit nicely with the plot and are interesting to watch. Another thing i like about the series is how the villains are treated. They are also given screen time to show their development and are not just mindless and one-dimensional. It's not just the good guys getting all the attention. The artwork was beautifully done and was a great conversion from the manga. As for the voices, i prefer the english dubbed over subbed. I felt that unlike other animes, naruto's doubbed voice actors were casted brilliantly and even surpassed the japanese seiyuus, because their voices suited the characters better. They also didn't sound forced and contrived, like other series do, which was a plus. Overall, i rate naruto an outstanding 10 because its the best anime i've seen to date and it will probably claim that number one spot for a really long time. Go watch it, if you haven't already. Check out the manga version too. You won't regret it.",10,Recommended,"Feb 13, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_898ce4cdb0,7,3199
"This is my first review, and I might be a bit jumpy and in-cohesive, so I would like to apologize before you read any further. This is also the first anime I ever really watched, although my opinion of it has changed over the years. When I first watched Naruto, I was completely obsessed. For days on end, I would complete tons of episodes, entranced by the plot, the characters, the fights, the emotional tug, and the sheer ecstasy I felt by seeing Naruto win over his battles. There is always something magical about seeing someone being shunned for so long find something greater than blank, cruel stares. Yet, at the same time, I was too naive in the anime world. I had no way to compare such things as story, art, sound, etc. Naruto was the best because it was the only one. Surprisingly, as I ventured into less well-known anime, my view of Naruto became a bit more critical. My initial amateur eyes that adored that yellow-haired boy and his adventures judged the not-so-amazing art, the lack of intense emotional appeal or response, and its amount of fillers (there are quite a few). The fact that Naruto was one of the so-called ""Big Three"" was enough for me; that in itself shot its rank up my list. That is, until I began to realize maybe it's so popular because it's quite an easy anime to accept? I am still not sure, but I do not want to deny it has been a good enough anime for me. Story: 7/10 Just from the synopsis alone, anyone should be able to realize the story will have at least some depth in it. Beneath the usual light and comical air Naruto tends to bring on screen is a darker secret that he tries his best to hide his pain and loneliness. That already makes a powerful story, something many viewers can watch and learn from. Naruto teaches many lessons, especially about not giving up. Perhaps what makes it so popular is Naruto's continuous drive to find acceptance. So much of the anime revolves around that goal, but that then makes so much of it quite amazing. I may be slightly judgmental here, but given the black/white nature of Naruto, there seems to be a bit of a skew. It is easy for the anime to be easygoing, but it seems to need something sad in order to develop its other side. That seems to be quite ironic because Naruto's life for a long time was one without friends and light. At the same time, I would understand it because in a way Naruto is trying to move on, but it just feels like the pain and suffering endured in the past is forced by their current circumstances (if that even made sense). Art: 6/10 I realize if I reviewed this anime years ago when I first watched it, I would probably give it a 9 or 10. The art was not heavenly, the battles were not that epic (some were), and sometimes it just seems the artists did not put too much effort in. To summarize, I've seen better. Sound: 7/10 Generally when I watch anime, I do not pay too much attention to music, but it does heighten certain feelings when played in the right time. Naruto does a good job, especially during moments of sadness. Those for me stand out the most. For the rest of the moments, though, the music just blends in. It is not particularly super, but not bad either. Character: 7/10 Character development is pretty good. A lot of time is spent on main characters' pasts which add depth and understanding. Although not everybody gets their fair share on the spotlight, enough is given and explained. Enjoyment: 6/10 I personally enjoy deep plots. Naruto had a focus on that, with its emphasis on Naruto's past suffering and pain, but at the same time the amount of deviation from its original standpoint somewhat irritated me. In other words, I didn't really like all of the fillers. Sometimes they provided more background, which was nice, but usually they were out-of-the-blue and did nothing to the storyline at all. Overall: 7/10 Maybe if Naruto was the 5th anime I watched and not the 1st, it would have been ranked lower. However, I feel the beauty of this anime comes from its huge popularity. It's widely known throughout the world (probably), and that's what makes it unique. Sure it is not the best anime out there, but it does deserve some respect for being so... natural. It's one of the most natural anime out there. Give it a shot.",7,Recommended,"Jul 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b299e786fb,8,4270
"First time i watched Naruto i did not like it. Second time i did not like it but since all the people praised it for being so good i saw 5 episodes of it. Before that i didnt even got through the 1. And i liked it. The story takes place in an alternitive world where ninjas exist. And you will be following Naruto and his life as an ninja. He is an 12 year old kid who graduates from the ninja acadmey at the first episode and so his the journey begins with Uchiha Sasuke and Sakura Haruno as Team 7. If you like the system, world etc you will love this serie, even if youre not a fan of the main charachter. The best thing about Naruto is the story and charachters. You will feel sympathy for almost everyone and at some point you might even cry. The music is also a great thing. Toshiro Masuda who composed the soundtrack is godlike. You will be listening to the soundtrack the rest of your life after this. The first 135 episodes are godlike. Even tho they did censored some things its still awsome but after that the rest is just fillers. Then there is Shippuuden, Its a continue of Naruto when is older but they thought of Naruto as a way to make money so the Anime went down a bit. But the Shippuuden manga is even better then the first 135 episodes.",10,Recommended,"May 12, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e174891773,8,1256
"So.... Naruto. I don't really know why I'm writing this review as my first review, there are plenty already, and I don't particularly care about the series... I guess it's one of those whims. Let's move on to the review then, I'll try to keep it short. And btw, I'm writing the review for the whole Naruto series, including Shippuden and the rest. Naruto is without any shred of doubt, the most popular anime outside Japan today. Completely surpassed any high Pokemon, Dragon Ball or Yu-gi-oh ever achieved, the whole world all of a sudden just can't have enough ninjas. These are all for a good reason, the anime completely blew most American cartoon in term of maturity, art quality, story and bgm, yet somehow keep it simple enough for kids to love. It didn't deliberately dumb itself down as if mocking 12+ years old kids brain size, yet not twisted enough to ruin an 8 years old fantasies and innocence. Suddenly kids are treated to a cartoon that not only gets you laughing but also complex and heart rending. Now the question is, why did I only gave the anime a 6 if it is that good? Because ultimately, this anime is a kids stories disguised as something mature. And as a mid-20s seasoned anime enthusiast (read: otaku), it's just hard for me to find this engaging. Here's the complete breakdown: Plot (5) - Debatable: Why debatable? Because maybe for younger audience, this was a masterpiece, who knows? But for me, the protracted episodes length, the out of place fillers that keeps contradicting the canon, the almost stale twists in every corner of the plot only to be replaced by yet another twists. 5 is generous. Art (5): Completely mediocre, barely average (thus the 5). Understandable since the anime is made to be long running, but it doesn't erase the fact that the art quality is lacking compared to other shorter series from the same time. Sound (7.5): As with other popular JUMP's anime such as One Piece, Bleach, Beelzebub, etc. the op and ed were typically beautiful, picked from various famous contemporary j-pop/rock. The in-anime BGM was nothing special. Chara (6) - Debatable: Nothing special, typical of shonen series. Sasuke's breakthrough as one of the most likeable antagonist is pretty notable, as his duality existence with Naruto had been the driving force of this series since the time skip. Enjoyment/Overall (6) - Debatable: It was pretty enjoyable at first, especially back at the time when I still don't mind watching anime with more than 50 episodes. But after 100+ episodes, with each episodes so protracted, with not much happening, I decided to drop the anime and just read the manga. This is not isolated to only Naruto, but I always find that anime adaptation of the manga tend to move really slowly and less enjoyable than the manga, especially if it's JUMP's. So that's my review and I just want to leave a few words, for all of you so called 'Narutards', Naruto is not the best anime ever, it was not even close and never will be. It was good, and that's it. For trolls and haters, No, the anime is not as bad as you make it to be.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 4, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8361d72689,8,3080
"Ok, first things first. Im a girl. I'm more of a shoujo person. And at first I thought Naruto was stupid. I like animes like Ouran High school or Fruits Basket, But even if you are like me and you don't like action, let me tell you this: YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!! After watching the first ten episodes I fell in love with it. And in a month, I'm already done with the first season of Naruto (220 episodes) and now waiting for the 336th episode of Naruto Shippuuden to be released. The art isn't bad, and I just love the characters. Naruto is really really funny, you have to make sure you go take a piss before you watch an episode. I may make it sound very calm, but the author did a really really good job at blending blood, fighting, comedy, and a tiny bit of love in it. There are a lot of morals, like ""never give up"". It's not too confusing to understand all the concepts of the shinobi. I really really enjoyed the story and the characters. A MUST WATCH FOR GUYS AND GIRLS EVEN!!!

"When this show started off I loved it. I loved every episode, the action was great, and it had some interesting story development. But then the show went on and as it went I spiraled down fast. Naruto himself got annoying, Sakura got frustratingly moany about Sauske, and Sauske turned out to be an arse. But the thing that really turned me off to the show fastest was the story line and how they were trying to get that laugh, and mostly just pandering to the age group that finds fart jokes funny. It got really irksome when an entire mission/story ark gets completely destroyed when Naruto rips one (I'm looking at you Bikochu Beetle). The show still has some amazing fight sequences, and the overall concept shows that it could have been an amazing anime, if it had only decided to step out of the kiddy grades and not try to make us laugh at lame humor.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 17, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_749f014923,8,858
"People who complain about fillers and things dragging out are just clueless to the times this was animated in. Naruto was animated between 2002 and 2007. It was animated on a weekly basis because the Manga was amazing and very popular. The best part of the anime is the writing, the music, and the subbed voice acting. If you watch Naruto and compare it to modern anime that's just stupid because nowadays they have so much more technology to help with the animation and they often take year long breaks to animate new seasons while they never really did that with Naruto. It's also really easy to skip the fillers if you really want, but they are also great to watch after you finish the series. The fillers give the other characters outside the main cast some time to shine and it gives people who read the manga some new things to see. I see people writing essays about how long the fillers drag on when they didn't even watch it when it aired. That was the real pain for us. Waiting for the plot to continue while the fillers were going was rough for most people who were watching back then, but it was because the Manga was still being written and Shonen wanted to keep Naruto going as it was one of the big 3 (Naruto, One Piece , Bleach) for a long time. Looking back at it I appreciate the fillers and prefer that to waiting years for the next season with no content in-between.

I prefer to think of it as misplaced OVA material. Fillers aside, I find this an awesome series, very well constructed, mixing great battle intensity with intricate major and side plots, and placing focus on character development. Only in its last arc does it drag for too long, and for a while it becomes almost arcade like - battle after battle after battle. Story stays on hold for a while, and for that reason it earns no perfect score - indeed, I almost rated it with an 8, but because the previous arcs were so great, a 9 should be fair.",9,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a48c14af40,8,709
"Unlike most Naruto fans, I didn't grow up watching it. I never had some kind of emotional connection with it. It was only recently that I decided to watch it, and that was only because everyone was talking about how good it was and blah blah blah. Now, almost a year after I finished the show, Naruto is one of the few anime that I believe is truly outstanding! Don't be scared by the 720 episodes of the franchise. It seems a lot, but it isn't. Watching the first 10-20 episodes of the series didn't give me a different impression; it was just another anime about ninja, I thought! When the actual plot began, I couldn't get myself away from the screen. It was so interesting that I just couldn't help but wanting to know what was going to happen next! But why is Naruto so good? Let's start with the story. It's appears to be pretty simple! The story is set in an alternative world where ninjas exist. It's an easy and believable concept that you don't have to think to much about. Then we have the characters! There are so many characters in the Naruto series, but each of them is so unique, that I can remember everyone's names AND surnames. The main character, Naruto, is not perfect, which is something that makes the series even better. Throughout the series we see his flaws, his troubles, his actions and we also see him grow up and change into a better person. He is not a kid who has a perfect life and wants to be a hero. He has a goal, and a reason for that goal. All that make Naruto's character more realistic and more relatable. Then we have the Antihero of the series, Sasuke. Sasuke is the exact opposite of Naruto, and at the same time, they are so alike. Sasuke's character is also not perfect. He himself has many flaws and has made many mistakes throughout the series. But what truly makes him a good character is that he ALSO has a reason for his actions. I can't write any of the details because I'm trying not to spoil anything. Moving on to the soundtrack. I am a soundtrack lover. Naruto's soundtrack is unlike anything you have ever heard before. It combines traditional Asian instruments with modern rhythms. The result of that was outstanding. And if you become a fan of this series, some of these soundtracks will stick in your brain for life and whenever you hear it, you'll feel nostalgic. Next we have the Art. Naruto is not a recent anime, so don't expect the highest quality. But to tell you the truth, that didn't matter. At least not to me. I enjoyed the show despite that. Besides, the quality gets better in Shippuden. Finally, the most important feature of not just the show, but the entire franchise, are the hidden meanings and messages it has about life. I often find myself following the examples that Naruto characters set in the series. Overall, I think that the Naruto franchise is a hidden gem among the anime world, and I highly recommend it. It doesn't matter how old you are! I plan to watch it again one day, with my kids. One thing is for certain; Naruto will always have a special place in my heart!",10,Recommended,"Sep 9, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ae9a7fddd5,8,3054
"Nostalgia is probably pumping up my ratings here haha. Naruto (excluding fillers, please if you're gonna watch skip them because this is a long ass series and they don't really add anything to the story in my opinion) is a really good story when it starts out. As a shounen genre type thing I really liked the exploration of darker themes with ultimately good messages. The character development is interesting, the story is engaging, and it it gives you characters to root for. It can be funny, it can be sad. It's enjoyable and a really common gate way anime. That being said it was originally made for younger audiences and is by no means a true masterpiece of any kind. If you look too much into it you're gonna find a ton of plot holes (and this increases doubly in Shippuden and x100 for anything post that) so enjoy it for what it is.

"This review contain minor spoilers Naruto is the very first manga I have seen and I think it's time for me to give an objective review of the serie. And despite many people gave Naruto low scores, I'll explain why I give it a 9. Story: 8 First of all, if you want to enjoy Naruto, skip all the fillers, they are not part of the story and it won't hurt to skip them. The story of naruto is outstanding considering it is one of the first long shounen series out there. I will not tell the story in detail but it is basically about main character naruto's path to prove himself and defend his friendship with sasuke. If you have seen a lot of shounen animes, then you would probably realise that many other animes have their story background or several arcs based on Naruto, Boku no hero academy' tournament arc and attack on titan's background of a titan broke into nine pieces. I would say that naruto may not have the best plot considering all the animes that came out after it, but it is definitely one of the best when it was airing. Please do consider this while rating it. Apart from that, most of the arcs in Naruto are super exciting, I will not spoil here, but if you consider Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden as a whole, you will realize that the whole story is very well structured. Art: 6 I gave Naruto's art 6 because again, at the same time you are saying about contemporary anime's great animation, please do bear in mind that Naruto came out several years ago, it is simply not fair to compare Naruto's art to other animes that came out decades after. Though I have to admit that from contemporary perspective, naruto's art is not good. If you really can't bear the animation, I suggest you read the manga instead, it is much better and I would not recommend you to drop the serie just because of animation. Sound: 9 I do like all the voice actors. Naruto's OPs are also fantastic, no need to explain more. Character: 10 Now this is the best part of Naruto in my opinion. Though Naruto is a typical protagonist, hot-blooded, works hard and has some gifts given to him, but you could see his change from the begining to the end, the way he viewed friendship and responsibility. Sasuke, in my opinion, is a very -well built character, all of his actions are reasonable, and I don't understand why people are saying they don't understand sasuke's change from a revenger to Naruto's ally, it is probably because they just did not pay much attention to the story, as someone who finished all the manga and anime about Naruto, I promise you what they are saying are not the case. Side characters are also great, particularly members of the Akatsuki; now these are typical example of good villains, they don't do ""evil"" for the sake of doing evil, but rather have their complex mindset and way of viewing the world. Each of them carries a different dream like love, peace, childhood, etc. It sometimes makes you question whether or not they are the evil. Enjoyment: 10 I definitely enjoyed the serie, but if you don't insist on watching animes I would rather recommend you to read manga instead, it is much more enjoyable. Overal: 9 Great anime, but received many unjust ratings just because fillers and aged animation, which in my opinion, are just unfair to Naruto",7,Recommended,"Dec 15, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e07e8faee6,8,3269
"So ever since I started watching Naruto - I've read the manga, and only recently decided to give the anime a go - I've been, for some reason, unconsciously comparing it to Shingeki no Kyojin - my all-time favourite manga. After the first episode of Naruto, I gave the show an 8. It was good. I'll give you that. The majority of anime don't get any more than a 6 from me usually. Shingeki no Kyojin, after the first episode, also got an eight. But I only changed that 8 to a 9 after the tenth Naruto episode, while Shingeki no Kyojin's eight turned into an immediate 10 after the second episode. Now, why is that? I'll try and explain. Firstly: sfx and music. The atmosphere set up in Shingeki no Kyojin by the music accompaniments is absolutely flawless. In Naruto, I find that those things aren't as good. Some of the sfx and music are cliché. A lot of the 'touching' moments are filmed in such a terrible way that I couldn't decide if the show-makers intended us to understand it an a parodied way or a serious way. Maybe that's just me. But oh well, we all have our personal opinions. Secondly: characters. This may be because I've read the manga previously, but I feel that the characters in Naruto, from the very first episodes of the manga, are very predictable, excepting a few choice moments. In SNK, there is no such thing. Every new development is a surprise. Every twist, every turn of the wrist and every trip decision comes as a complete shock. Thirdly: direction of plot. One of the first things we hear Naruto say is that he wants to become the next Hokage. Since the show is named after him, we can safely assume, even from the first episode, that he will surmount all the coming obstacles and ascend to the position of Godaime no matter what obstacles lie in his path. I like the show, I really do. BUT THAT'S BORING. I don't like 'predictable' things - one of the reasons I prefer Shingeki no Kyojin. With SNK's plot, and with its developments, we have no idea whether or not killing the titans will ever be achieved. The main character's - Eren's - goal is to discover the outside world, and to do that he has to destroy the titans. He has no choice in the matter. It's that or getting killed. But with the number of deaths within the main characters and supporting characters, we could just as well safely assume that he'll get killed himself before he can even find out what the heck it was that his father left in his basement. Hell, even as I speak, Eren is being held captive in some rich guy's basement and about to be eaten by one of his best friends. And there seems to be no possible way out of it. A lot of the fans agree that it's possible he - the main character - will die. Naruto dying? Not possible. Never even considered. There can be no NARUTO without Naruto. Fourthly: this last one is personal taste, but I tend to prefer really serious mangas/animes with very few comic relief (Sacha and Connie are two of the only comic relief characters in SNK, while ALL of Naruto's characters provide comic relief), heavy plot, manipulations, intrigues, and whatnot. I find that Naruto (the show, not the character, because Naruto Uzumaki is one of the characters I relate to the most in any anime) has TOO much comic relief, and takes TONNES away from the beauty and intensity that could be the show. There's more, but I can't think how to put it into words. I tried my best not to give any SNK spoilers. No names. Hope this is helpful to anyone who's been thinking the same thing or was looking for a comparison of the two. If you want to contact me to talk about this, or for any other reason, actually, then do! I'd be glad to meet someone new.",9,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_d21e35ed1b,8,3674
"Pros: everything, but only up to about the first 50 episodes (plus the clashes between the 3 legendary shinobidos later on) Cons: everything since then The anime is well viewed and understood. It thus does not require synoptic reviews. I'll just share some personal experience with the anime. I started watching the series a lot later than most people, but once I started, I had no trouble comprehending the frenzies my friends would have about the series -- a tale of ninja and their mysterious techniques (grown up in China, I love all things elemental-related when it comes to magics and fantasies), a depiction of the hierarchy and conflicts in the Japanese Warring era, and a ballard of growing-up with tears, efforts and friendship. It was an awesome escape from the real world, with either new shinobido techniques or new character stories to reveal every episode-- there is always mystery, suspension, and action. However, (as with all things, there has to be a ""however""), that's only up to about 60 episodes, if I recall right. After that, the series is reduced to episodic missions that do not further the storyline or introduce any new techniques. The motifs of each small story are boring and blank at best. The whole series simply turned into a repetitive, dungeon-ish, adventure anime probably only geared for grade-schoolers. Just to name one of its vice, it occurs in every single episode that some character, in a super intensive, emergent and often life-threatening situation (as depicted by the character's monologue anyway), would somehow freeze and take ages to make the simplest decision or the most obvious tactical observation -- as if the viewers all have IQ of none when viewing this series. What does the anime itself do during all these pauses? About 7 seconds zooming in on the same frame. And then? Another 7 seconds zooming out! If not longer!! It's almost sever to the point that I can barely enjoy the episodes as animations but instead voiced CG drama. I gave up after a few episodes of those, obviously. I would revisit the series occasionally and only receive disappointment - not to anybody's surprise. Hence, my overall rating -> 3/10, in a protest against the inattention of the producer to the later part of the series, while the partial ratings remain high, in a tribute to the series' quickly-diminished potential. EDIT: Unlike normal rating, the word clause remains neutral/positive until the score is lower to as bad as 3 when writing a comment -> partly the reasons for the low score.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 4, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2c5ed85e15,8,2530

"Believe in the Naruto that believes in you... that’s what Kamina said at least, right? Naruto is iconic. With all the Naruto-running, cropped pictures of Sasuke being choked, and the forgotten classic of “Tobi is a good boy” memes that have laced the Internet, this the Digital Age is not without its Naruto influence and perhaps even bigger to people today than what Dragon Ball was to the generation prior. I wouldn’t be surprised if at least 10% of all zoomers have seen some form of Naruto in their life too. It’s an anime that deserves to be experienced. If it wasn’t already apparent, I love Naruto. Naruto was one of the first anime I remember watching where I was aware what I was watching was just that. I would even credit the show for lifting my fascination for Japan and all things anime off the ground too. Going from staying up late with friends to catch the latest weekly episode on Toonami, to going to the Naruto website to catch the latest subbed episode, to reading the manga, and rewatching the show over and over again as the years went on. But over those years I’ve slowly become disillusioned with the it all; Naruto quickly became one of the more contentious shows I’ve groan to know. I have to say though, from the get go, what I appreciated about Naruto conceptually, ever since I first tuned into the show, was how it managed to subvert viewers through its premise. Knowing its creator, Masashi Kishimoto, originally had in mind to write his now highly-acclaimed, modern classic manga as a story that happened to revolve around shinobi arts as a vehicle to depict the value of friendship, it’s incredible in the amount of world building put into the it all, stringing together all sorts of East-Asian lore, mythology, and history to make up much of the inspiration. Instead of mercenaries set in a traditional, Edo-period Japan, we instead get a group of teenagers graduating from an academy to achieve their genin status depicted in a brand new ninja universe. All of that in mind, I’d go as far to say the world in Naruto is one of my favorites in any show. That brief mention about teenagers attending an academy? That’s only relevant for the first three episodes — arguably one. It’s funny how often I remember Naruto as a show about students attending a ninja academy when it’s not even near the core of the show itself. Instead we have students broken up into squads of four, consisting of three just-graduated genin and one jonin, the highest rank of shinobi, and it’s this dynamic we will be used to. Having the show revolve around a squad and not a room full of students at a school allows for more freedom in the story for our characters to move and a better chance for us to learn about the world through action. Like most shounen, action anime/manga, there is a power system in Naruto: chakra. Chakra is energy stored in all shinobi for which they utilize it through intense rigorous training and allows them to active various forms of jutsu. This power system, although better thought up compared to Dragon Ball, but one that’s not as well managed or balanced as Hunter X Hunter. More on that later. The different jutsu shinobi can learn and use include the three basics: ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. There are also other, specific techniques like fuinjutsu which is a sealing style of jutsu meant to lock or unlock words, people, or chakra amongst other things into scrolls and paper tags. There are even techniques only specific individuals can utilize, being kekkei genkai. These are hidden techniques known only to specific clans or otherwise other passed down through their bloodline. One such example is doujutsu, an “eye” ability that, if they possess the correct eyes, can perform unimaginable abilities. Having chakra, as well as the focus, allows a shinobi to walk up walls and on water. There is a huge rabbit hole of information regarding the different shinobi arts and reading about it online is just as interesting as watching ten show itself, if not more. However, the gripe I have about this system is there isn’t any clear way distinctly knowing how much chakra someone has or how much is used up. Sometimes you’ll see characters fatigued or will straight up say they’ve used up all their chakra but you’ll find that any character can get around this through convenience or outside circumstance. No more chakra to use on your opponent? No problem, just run out of the way, perfectly throw a target, or have a neighboring ally save you from harm. If all else fails, just give it a little bit of time and you’ll suddenly regain enough chakra to use soon after. Jutsu get pretty ridiculous from time to time too. Although not nearly as bad as the power creep would get in Shippuden, moments where Kakashi and Zabuza, an incredibly skilled mercenary and Jonin that’s said to be just as powerful as Kakashi, are shown making hand signs, lasting around 10 seconds or so to do, in order to summon two giant dragons made from water out of a nearby lake, and that’s the only time you see a sequence as detailed as that. Every time characters do hand signs, time is not nearly as spent on the action and newly graduated Genin are able to do this while fighting off the enemy. Sure these are not just teenagers but ones that have gone through years of training to be able to do any of this, but it downplays the nature of battling with jutsus and sooner than later you find nearly every single fight is primarily a battle with magical powers. Again, thankfully this isn’t so much a problem in the OG Naruto show as it is in Shippuden, but the leniency of not having a tighter grip on the power system and the powers that come from it create too much risk for something out of control. Our main cast consists of Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, and for sake of brevity will focus more on than their importance’s to the show itself. The characters themselves, although not anywhere near the most original I’ve seen (especially for a shounen), share a strong distinction from the other, complementing each other’s strengths. The primary colors are often paired with green, for a fourth color like in the Opponent Process theory, and our main cast members all distinctly fit into each color (with a secondary color to boot), setting them apart easily when together and allowing room for their personalities to shine more. Naruto has both yellow and orange to emphasize hope, energy, and a bright future. Sasuke has a deep blue and black to contrast Naruto especially as well as show his dark and dejected past. Sakura having red and pink to represent the passion and love she bears. And Kakashi in a green and white which tells us how calm and focused he is towards his life and his students. It’s a simple yet effective way of storytelling, further preparing us for who shares the screen. The side characters to any show are only as strong as their mains and thankfully this show has plenty of good ones. There are several other squads that graduated from the same academy Naruto came from and each have their own distinct personalities as a squad. Unfortunately, every character outside of the main four have muted color schemes but up close you’ll notice their cool individual designs. Each character has an unmistakable style or “gimmick” to them and it makes for interesting scenarios for when they’re on the battlefield. Growing up and entering middle school around the time I was first watching Naruto, I fell in love with most of the characters found. I was enamored with their dynamics and interaction both in and outside a fight. It was like having a awkward, fogged up view of what being a teenager could be like... only without the ninja stuff. What’s unfortunate is those characters I loved would only appear for a certain number of episodes and then later, when that arc would end, would never be seen again until the next arc, if that (sorry Ten-Ten fans). As hopeful as one could be, not every side character is given the same treatment as another. Some are treated like temporary main characters, others barely have any lines. It’s as if Kishimoto doesn’t know what to do with them aside from being window dressing, with more screen time given to some in some of the ops and eds rather than the actual episodes (again, sorry Ten-Ten fans). Something Naruto does well though is how they handle their arcs. They are recognizable from each other and last for a long while, so unfortunately if an arc doesn’t excite you, it can come off like a drag sitting through it. Naruto, for better or worse, has two really great arcs, The Chunin Exam arc and The Retrieval arc. Every arc Kishimoto creates can be split into sections, which make for an exceptional way of handling them, but the two in reference are well beloved by fans for good reason, as they do an exceptional job in its overall content and refreshing narratives compared to some other long-running shows. I’ll admit that getting through some arcs feel a little “meh” than others, but I’d argue they at least hold a lot of significance and maintain an identity all in itself and the progress you see Naruto and co. go through. All in all, it’s a net positive in the arc department. Now, I gotta focus on the negatives, because if there is something I think Naruto doesn’t get enough flack for is its pacing. Naruto has filler, an ass load of it, but even during canonical episodes you will witness poor pacing that cuts the seams in the production schedule. Showing anyone this show, at this day of age, can be cringe inducing. Having to sit their with your significant other as you watch all the characters stand around for nearly a minute as the scene pans around, closes in on everyone’s reactions, and zooms in on a single still shout of the “action” itself. Hearing a chuckle accidentally release from a confused viewer, I am reminded we are watching mediocrity and not something with proper heart and creativity put in. If the show isn’t randomly inserting filler in the middle of an arc, then it is bogging down the episode by stretching out its moments, contributing to the horrid pacing. Not every episode is like this and several fights in here I’d argue are among some of the best fights in anime ever, but that’s only a fraction of what makes up the bulk of this show. I mentioned it before, but Naruto is plagued with its filler content. If you’re wanting to pick this show up, just know it is quite the undertaking. I already mentioned one of the shows to precede Naruto, being Shippuden, but the other is Boruto, which is a spin-off taking place after the events of Shippuden, so to get the complete Naruto animated experience you not only will have to complete 220 episodes from here, 500 episodes of Shippuden, maybe the 11 films sprinkled here and there, and the currently airing Boruto: the Next Generation which is sitting at 185+ episodes as of this writing. I’d honestly pit a good argument that it’s more of a journey getting through all the show than our titular character has ever experienced. So, how much filler are we talking here? Well, firstly, I will admit that I too, sometimes, will not give my full attention to a show for every single moment it graces my screen. This is mostly due to the lack of time I have to enjoy to myself outside of when I’m working and would rather indulge in multiple outlets. So the idea of someone not committing to giving their full attention to the filler in Naruto is understandable, but it’s still questionable. If you consider the 720 episodes of Naruto and Shippuden combined, there are 425 episodes that are canon to the manga. That’s 59.03% that is actually related to the story being driven. Just slightly over half of the animated television material is worth consideration of being absolutely crucial in the eyes of many fans. Something that’s far more common than I expected for new fans of the show to do is follow a PDF, usually one found somewhere online, that list the different episodes dedicated to being filler, and skip those episodes. And that’s the problem. If a show has way too much filler that you’re willing to skip, perhaps that says a lot about the product itself or maybe the viewers that skip it all without question are hesitant to admit the show’s shortcomings. Perhaps that overall rating isn’t deserved? Hmm.. I’m actually a fan of filler. For the most part I’ve never really minded it before or after knowing whenever I’ve watched any too. Naruto, for a majority of the time, has some good filler. There is some bad filler, in fact, literally the second episode in the series is a filler episode. That episode is a bad and annoying episode, and while we are at it, if you’re about skipping episodes, you can probably just skip the first two episodes as the third episode makes for an amazing pilot episode and is one of my absolute favorites in the series, but that’s neither here nor there. Many that have watched the filler with agree that the episode involving Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke trying to see what’s under Kakashi’s mask is an example of good filler. Although I personally don’t care for it, as it’s a bit too slapstick and tonally separate from much of the show, it’s at least a bit of proof that there is value in watching them. The Land of Tea and Land of Rice Patties arcs are two of my favorite sets of filler episodes that I think every fan should watch. Of course, many will still skip the filler as it’s a matter of principle and finishing the show as quickly as they can without being bogged down by events that are inconsequential regardless of the entertainment value. The art is both and hit and a miss. For the time it looked pretty good, but nothing stellar. Watching it now I’m able to notice more of the shortcuts the animators made when producing the show. Kishimoto has even expressed concern over his drawing abilities over time when illustrating. The show does have its fair share of sakuga, particularly in certain high stakes moments in anticipated fight scenes. But if there is one thing every Naruto fan CAN agree with it’s that Naruto has some of the best collection of ops and eds on the market. To me, Naruto felt like it was always trying to one up itself and change its theme music to not just keep us in tune for when a new arc/section of the show begins and ends, but just because it could. Naruto had the clout to justify its seemingly rapid output of ops and eds and each one sticks with you in some way. You could probably learn a lot about a person judging solely on which Naruto op and ed they favorite the most. Looking into everything, I’ll admit this show can be a fun ride and not even me at my most cynical, not even me after binging Neon Genesis followed by Angel’s Egg, not even me with a partner at my side could intellectually tear this Show down by saying it’s not fun. Because Naruto can be fun to watch. It’s a show you can easily get lost in. I didn’t want to focus on any spoilers but there’s plenty to nitpick there, but I can still understand why someone could like the show regardless. As essential this show is to experience, at this point in my life, if pacing/filler is an issue for you I cannot in good conscience recommend someone sit through at this show. Again, I believe it’s essential but you’d be better off lurking online for information regarding the show rather than be disappointed trying to commit to the entire thing. If you decide to check it out and watch a few episodes , I think you’ll know right away if you’re going to like this show and want to stick with it in the long run.

"I only recently got into anime, and so had the benefit of doing some research before watching the first series of Naruto. I was able to skip all of the filler episodes, and believe me, nearly 50% of the anime is filler. So, even though I said above that I've seen all 220 episodes, I've really only watched the canon episodes and a few of the recommended fillers. Even so, Naruto was one of those shows that needed to grow on me. Having previously watched Hunter x Hunter, it took me until after the Ninja Test arc to really get into it because so much of it reminded me of Hunter x Hunter. Nevertheless, once the two ""test"" arcs parted ways I felt Naruto better eased into its own thing. I have the character mark an 8 because when I began the show I only saw Naruto as a whiny brat, but by the end his character really grew on me. Pacing might be a bit slow for some, but I'm one of those people who enjoy back stories and getting to know characters better. For this reason I still have a few filler ""arcs"" that I've heard were good and might want to go back and watch. In the end, I thought the series was highly enjoyable to watch. I originally was hesitant to only watch the canon episodes, but having done so I'm glad I did. There are a number of websites that list these. Since the show is up in part on Netflix and other streaming avenues, I would also recommend finding the wiki on how the episodes divide into arcs.

"Like is the case for many people, Naruto was one of the first anime that I watched. And like a lot of people who hadn't seen much to compare it with, I loved it! But I grew up with Naruto and as time passed, I did find plenty wrong with it. Now it's a show that I like to make fun of out of love, like an old friend. So with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get to my actual thoughts on it. Naruto is seen as one of the most overrated series of all time because to any seasoned anime viewer, it IS average. The artwork can seem subpar, the shear number of filler episodes is terrifying, and certain dub voices can make you cringe. However, there are a few qualities that do make the series special. Not all of the music is great, but there are a few songs that you can't help but be moved by. And with the dozens of songs, you'll never get bored of hearing the same thing. Secondly, there's a great balance between plot, action, and fun time (granted, the humor isn't great, but hey, there's still action and drama, right?). And once you finish wading through the sea of filler, there are the moments that make it all worth it. But sometimes it does feel like work to get to those points, so if you're the type who would prefer an anime that doesn't hold back and jumps straight into an intense storyline, Naruto isn't for you. But if you enjoy a good long show that slowly develops lovable characters, is in no particular hurry to get where it's going (but it will get there), or just want to see an old classic, Naruto might be perfect for you. Personally, I may have to watch it again soon myself. After all, this show really did change my childhood and probably made me a better person. I hope it can do the same for everyone else.",8,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_89be956af7,8,1740
"Everyone makes Naruto out to be the most beginner anime out there; you can't watch anything until you've finished Naruto. While it is an older anime, and it isn't a bad anime, there are many things about Naruto that can be hard to follow, lame, or just cliche. Naruto comes along to be one of the greatest anime in existence - but I have to disagree. Like many of us here, we can agree that Naruto is a good anime... but it is a far cry from masterpiece. I have not finished all of Naruto, but I have watched most of it. I have an idea on how the rest of the anime will run. Story (6) For those of you who read the summary, this anime is about a young male, Naruto Uzumaki, who wants to surpass the Hokage, or leader of the Leaf Village, through training and hard work as a Shinobi (ninja). It was one of things that had originally drew me into this anime. It seemed incredibly original, and it actually is. Many well-detailed plot twists, interesting plot at times, and moments of triumph reign this anime supreme. But that's only a small part of the anime outside of the filler episodes that go through it. The original story of Naruto does sound very nice... it's about Naruto who wants to be Hokage. But the anime dwells further and further away from Naruto's dream that it starts showing up less in the main episodes and starts making a new home inside of the filler episodes, where you can watch literal hours of Naruto trying to learn something, fail, and then do something ""spectacular"" or ""creative"" to master a technique. I kid you not, it's one of the most boring things to watch in an anime... ever. As I mentioned before, the plot about Naruto begins to fade and shed new light on anime all-time favorite character Sasuke Uchiha, the last of the Uchiha clan, who survived a massacre not too long before the events of the anime, and when he wants revenge on a certain man. This is a great side-plot, but the thing that bugs me the most is that many episodes focus on Sasuke's dark desire to bring his family the justice they deserve. I believe several people already pointed it out in other reviews... You being watching many filler Naruto scenes, and many plot-ridden Sasuke scenes. Like I said, for the most part, story's really nice. But the amount of filler and add-ons were enough to make four different Naruto mini-series called Sasuke, Naruto Training, Goofy Garbage, and Boring Garbage. Art (8) Graphics are at the best an 8. The character designs were key in my approval of the art style, but the animation flunked some times and characters could be unrecognizable in combat unless they were the focus of the camera. The art style, in my opinion, while old - looks very clean and nice, and I find it to be very creative and appealing to look at, even if it lacks detail in far-ranged shots. Again, character design was cool. Kakashi looks wonderful and like a true ninja and the members of the Akatsuki are pretty unique. Sound (8) Some music is good, other parts, not good. The opening songs in Naruto are very annoying and forgettable, as I found myself reaching for my remote to skip ahead of it and try not the die from ear blood loss. I don't know how others feel about the openings, but personally, I find all of them to be very horrible. Sound effects used are comical and had me laughing a lot at times. Naruto's blissful stress and irritation can be seen entirely through the noise each character makes when they are in such states of distaste. Especially Sasuke. Snotty little boy. Character (9) Characters are my favorite things in Naruto. While they can be repetitive and lack originality, which is why I give this section a 9 over a 10, most of the people in this are very interesting and make memorable moments through-out the anime, even Rock Lee, who had me scared at night thinking about that bowl cut and perfectly round eyes. Most characters have their flaws and evil sides, which is what makes for a truly interesting character, even Naruto, who has the spirit of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox inside of him, an aspect that makes the Hidden Leaf Village have large urges against him. Enjoyment (7) Story is good, lots of humor added in there, enjoyable characters, and generally interesting action sequences are what make this have a higher rating. However, even with the pros listed above, Naruto has many moments of filler episodes, fights that last for 10+ episodes, and events that happen in the fillers that had me pulling my teeth out. I get that it's not necessary to watch filler episodes, but it still exists. Very hard to enjoy watching repetitive things happen during the course of Naruto's training, especially when he is with Pervy Sage (Jiraiya). So I give this a 7. Overall (7) To round this off, Naruto isn't a bad anime. It's definitely one someone should hit if they haven't already, but don't expect your socks to be flying off during the events of what happen in this anime. This anime is good - but it isn't as great as everyone makes it out to be. If you have the time to be sitting through 200+ episodes, go ahead and watch this, and be sure to skip the filler episodes unless you want to be bald from tearing your hair out.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a4cbbd856e,8,5184
"While not to everyone's tastes, I personally thought this anime was amazing. Granted, it's one of those types of anime that you might think of as more of a cartoon than an anime. Very well designed characters that really evolve and change in dramatic, noticeable ways. The plot left me twisting in my seat and biting my nails in anticipation the entire time. You never know what will happen, only that it'll be something amazing and very exciting. Naruto changes everyone he meets and changes everyone's thoughts about practically everything. There isn't much romance, but there are a lot of dynamic characters. Everyone is different. It isn't exactly supernatural, but it is more than natural. Everyone has their own kinds of different powers. Overall, an amazing anime. I simply loved it and have rewatched it no less than two or three times. Plan on watching it again in the future. Probably one of the longest good anime series ever. Can't wait to finish the continuing series, Naruto Shippuden.",9,Recommended,"Dec 22, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c5820b3179,9,999
"This is the show that got me hooked on anime. STORY: I really loved the beginning of the story, including the training and exam. Since my favorite character of this series is Kakashi, I loved watching Team 7 go on missions and learning new tricks. I didn't like the story towards the end because I am not a fan of Orochimaru, even though he is pretty cool. ART: I loved the art most of the time, but since the art changes so much, there were some art styles I didn't like SOUND: It is known to have one of the best soundtracks of all time for a reason. The music is so good covers of the music get over 90 million views on youtube CHARACTER: As I said above, I love Kakashi. The rest of the characters are great as well (except Sakura) ENJOYMENT: I loved this anime and it felt like 200 episodes were over in a day.

"** I dropped the show at Episode 148 (13 episodes into the fillers) + A vast and interesting ninja world - Terrible pacing (too slow) exploring the world and characters + Likeable characters with different personalities - Sakura + Few characters are developed quite well (Sasuke, Gaara, Neji) - Most characters remain one dimensional - Naruto is the typical bratty shounen MC with exemplary morals + A unique soundtrack that felt perfect - Meh animation, though it is an old show + Chakra, element, jutsu system is interesting and creative. - Most fight scenes are too long, filled with bad dialogue and flashbacks. - Naruto may be weak, he may be a kid but he WILL yell at you and he WILL change your entire mindset. + Chuunin Exam Preliminaries - Fillers I watched 148 episodes in a week so despite its flaws I found Naruto enjoyable.

"Personally it is one of my favorite anime, it was the sixth anime that I saw, I want to clarify this, since many believe that ""Naruto"" is a childhood anime or as one of the first anime that have been seen and for that reason they brand it as overrated, I really don't think that way, I know people who have seen ""Naruto"" in his adulthood, and they really love it. Well having clarified that point I would like to give my opinion about this anime and why you should give it a try. *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* This anime considers that it has many good values to teach, the desire to improve yourself, the power of friendship, fight for your dreams and never give up, were the main ones. I also think that it can make you think about life and change your way of thinking. This anime teaches you that the world is not just black and white, there are gray tones, this can be seen referenced a lot in the ""villains"" that are in Naruto, these villains are not bad because yes, they all have a past, something that happened to them and I cause that they now have that way of thinking or being like that, that is why most people can sympathize with these characters. Before I had said that ""NARUTO"" can change your way of thinking and make you reflect about life, which is true, at least in my experience it was like that, I am a very pessimistic person, I give up very easily, I don't have any reason to live or some goal that I want to achieve, this thought has led me to think if it was really important to continue living, it sounds stupid, but that is what happened. I cannot and could not live without having a goal, I needed something to do in my life, but there was nothing, I had already given up, I was only living day to day, I was already planning to commit suicide, I had planned to do it in about 10 more years , I was not happy with my life. But there was something that did not let me, I always had two thoughts that collide with each other, I have a negative side but also a positive one, unfortunately for me the negative was winning. All those thoughts flooded my mind, no matter how hard I tried to get out of that bubble of negativity, it didn't work. Until I remember Naruto, how was it that a child who has a terrible childhood and life, that his parents are dead, I never get to know them, as if that weren't enough they died on the day of his birth, I mean your birthday is Important, one on those dates is generally happy, but knowing that your parents died on the date of your birth must be strong, it must be said that the people, the VILLAGERS, also blamed him (who at that time would be about 6 years old) of the death of the Hokage and the deaths of several more shinobi, all because a man wanted to control the Kyubi and take ""revenge"" against the village, causing the whole village to hate and despise a child who had not the slightest fault of this. But despite that, Naruto never had a grudge towards people, no matter how bad they treat him, he always stays strong. He always looks to the future, he had a goal, a DREAM, which was to become a hokage of his village, with this people would not despise him, but they would value him as he really is, as a person, not as a monster. I have always quite liked happy and pleasant people, his personality was and is perfect for me, I know he is clumsy and quite clueless, but his enthusiasm, his desire to live to fulfill his dreams, is the reason why I admire him so much. That was one of the things that captivated me, his energy, his attitude, his personality, but what I liked the most is that he had a goal, he always had it, this caused in me two feelings, envy and admiration. Envy because he knew that he could never be like him, he could never see the world with the same eyes that he sees them. I could never be happy like him. I could never have a dream, something that I am passionate about to continue with my life. Admiration because I always wanted to be like that, to have his enthusiasm for the things that he is passionate about, the desire to learn new things and that despite having very difficult moments I never give up, it is not an option, no more. I will not give up anymore, I still do not have a goal in my life, but that does not mean that I will lose, I will look for one, I will find something that I am passionate about. That's my goal, it's my ninja path. I will fight for my goals, and when I find a dream I will fight even more. I seriously know I recommend them too much if you are looking for something related to self-improvement, if you are going through a difficult time, especially in adolescence, where I am currently, I know that this process is complicated especially by mood swings or also confusing by hormones, in short. Have you heard of Naruto evangelizing characters in anime? Well let me tell you that Naruto evangelized me, he took me off the path of evil, that it would lead my life to misery if I continued with those mindless thoughts in my head. So I am very grateful to Naruto, I really love this series. SO BOYS AND GIRLS FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS. DO NOT GIVE UP.

"Post Series Depression: ~4.5 (reason after my overall statement) Tear Factor: ~1 - 7 (wide range) Laugh Factor: ~4 - 8 (wide range) Drama Factor: ~5 Character Attachment: ~10 DISCLAIMER: I may have some bias for this show however I will try to keep my review objective. Story: Can vary in quality ranging from amazing to dragging your feet in mud waiting for the next arc to pop up. Additionally ~40% of Naruto is fillers - skipping through fillers may speed up the story as some filler arcs are not necessary/canon. Art: By today's standards - yes - the show is very behind in quality, however by this I mean resolution. The art itself is iconic to its style and is still enjoyable. Sound: Naruto has a very wide range of sounds, which keep you interested, nothing becomes monotonous as you keep listening to the show. However, the show is again old - so you may hear artifacts in the environment sounds, etc.. Characters: This show is known for its characters. Each character is unique and you're more than likely going to find a favorite at some point, or multiple favorites, or your favorites may switch when you meet new people. Almost every character has their own filler arc as well or overall character development (leading into Shippuden as well). however heavy focus is laid into the leaf village. Enjoyment: This show has always been a favorite, I enjoyed re-watching it to make this review. I'd say you'd enjoy it if you're into shounen fighting anime. Overall: Very long series but great too. Skip fillers if you want story only (there are online guides for this). Post Series Depression: Though there is Shippuden after the original series. The mood, the characters, and even the fighting all change along with how the show works. Though it may still be Naruto at its core, something fundamentally changes with Shippuden that makes you miss the original series.",9,Recommended,"Jul 16, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb07c3ab10,9,1875
"Now, first off, I am not going to claim that Naruto is bad. I know a lot of people who would, but I won't. I also will not explain the plot, because once I start it gets hard to stop. What I am going to talk about is how Naruto lost me. It used to hold a very special place in my heart, because it was the anime that got me to look it up on the web, and finally discover what anime was and where to find it. I don't know how long it would have taken for that to happen otherwise, but it was the catalyst. Back in the day I was a diehard Naruto fan. Now, I'm going to start with what is good about the anime. The action is very good, and while I generally prefer One Piece and a couple other anime in that department, it's still well done. The music is very good, and gets you ready for a good time. The best thing, easily, are the characters. The cast is large and there are quite a few stand outs. Rock Lee is a personal favorite, but almost all of the main cast are very well done. Naruto himself is a great protagonist. When they delve into his childhood, it really works. The Zabuza storyline is probably the peak in quality, but the Chunin Exams/Gaara arc is my favorite. The ending fight works very well, though I've seen the same idea done better elsewhere. (Keep that in mind, I'll bring it up again in a couple of days.) Now for the bad. To start off, the problem with the great cast is that the writer has no clue how to focus. As time goes on, he spends less and less time with the initial cast that drew us in, and keeps throwing in new characters, only about one in ten of which are a fifth as good as the original characters. I don't want to spend more time with Sai, I want Hinata! For the anime the filler is atrocious, between Naruto and Shippuden literally a year and a half of filler. Some of it was good, but most was really bad, and because it was filler it was a year and a half where nothing of real importance could happen. Then there's the Sasuke problem. I didn't like Sasuke at first, but by the end of the Zabuza arc he had grown on me. But then the Sasuke retrieval arc reared it's ugly head, and now I can't stand the guy. And it got worse! Every time he's shown up since then he's made me more and more pissed. At one point it started to feel like Sasuke was supposed to be the protagonist, but luckily it switched perspectives again soon after. Plus, after the initial success of Zabuza and Gaara, I haven't liked the villains much. Orochimaru started off cool, but degraded fast. The Akatsuki didn't really impress me. The thing that gets me the worst though is the story. Over time, the plot has become more and more sidetracked and convoluted. It keeps going off-course, and not resolving what it's set up. Off everything that has happened so far, I think only the tailed beasts and Naruto's parents were things the writer knew when he started. Like I said earlier, the Gaara fight felt satisfying because it felt like it was built up to, and everything fit just right. I haven't felt that since, and that is a shame. Let me compare this with the anime I talked about yesterday, One Piece. One Piece set up huge plot points years in advance, in one case decades, and did so where it usually wasn't obvious that Oda was leading us there.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 11, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_44fc99681b,9,3271
Naruto is an Amazing Anime its characters backrounds and how sophisticated it is but it is a little annoying when some fights are dragged out sometimes that's bad other times its good as it gives more understanding and suspense the worst part of Naruto is the fillers which most people agree with like 50% of the story is just fillers especially around the second half of the story is when they start but before that it is a masterpiece and the villains are especially amazing. one of the best parts is also the intros/outros some of my favorite are the 5th intro and the 1st outro wind. so if you want to have a good time watching Naruto i recommend skipping the fillers in the second half unless you want to watch them.,9,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ef86b6bf55,9,721
"To be honest, I used to be obsessed with this anime. Literally. I would never watch any other AMVs besides the ones that included Naruto; I thought everyone who hated Naruto were idiots; I thought Sasuke was so hot, etc... But the thing is, I only enjoyed it up until a certain number of episodes. The reason for this is, it got boring. In my opinion, anyway. I think that they should've ended the anime at a certain spot. They shouldn't have put so many filler episodes, and Kishimoto shouldn't have made Naruto: Shippuden. But, I do think the plot is great. It had a lot of potentional. The characters were a bit cliche, but still enjoyable. The art could've been better, but it wasn't horrible. I think the thing that ruined it for me, is that the story dragged on and on until finally they ended it to make a Naruto:Shippuden. Also, I was soooo into it that I guess I finally got sick of it.

"First of all, why did most people here think that naruto was a good enough show to get at least a 7? Sorry if I am going against your opinion but I personally found this show alright. 1.) The story. At the start, naruto started off slow and I found it boring for a while until it got into it more. For that reason, I am rating the story a 6/10. 2.) Art The art style doesn't really matter to me in an anime but I will rate it anyway. Considering that naruto was first aired in 2002, it was expected that the art style wouldn't be as beautiful as some other anime's today. Knowing that I rate the art style a 6/10 3.sound The sound in the anime was good enough for me to at least enjoy it slightly. I will rate the sound 5/10 4.) Character. Now, this is the best thing about naruto, the characters. I found out that in the end, I got attached to some characters and wanted to see more. My favourite character would most likely be Kakashi for no reason whatsoever. I will rate the characters a 7/10. 5.)

"Naruto is one of the most famous anime series of all time.(along with One Piece). Its called the number one series ever and is also said to be called a masterpiece. This is not true. Naruto is far from a masterpiece. Is it bad? No. Is is amazing? Far from it. Its just good. Storyline7/10--Naruto is a young boy who wants to be the be the best ninja ever by training with his teacher, Kakashi, and his two friends, Sakura and Sasuke. They train toghter and try to become hokage. Naruto and his friends also learn to fight with chakra and fight bad guys. The idea starts off good, and is very enjoyable. However, there are WAY to many filler.(More then half the series is filler). Also, the pacing is very slow. It takes forever for arcs to finally finish. It is enjoyable at times, but does get old. Characters4/10-This is the worst part of Naruto. The characters arent that good. Naruto, is annoying. He never gets any better, his jokes get old. Sakura is no better. Shes very weak(she gets better, but still isnt the best). The back storys are enjoyable, but it seems like it came out of a drama anime. Gaara is the best character. Hes very strong, and has a good story. Sasuke is good, like Gaara, but the others arent.(well, neji is pretty good). The characters are bad, not terrible, just bad.(they also never mature). Soundtrack9/10-The OST is very good. I find it very enjoyable to listen to. The opening and ending themes are amazing. The battle music is epic. Naruto always had a great soundtrack. The sad music is beautiful. Art6/10-The art is fine. The character design isnt that good.(Expect for Gaara). The overall art look is decent. Ive seen better. I never think of it that much, because I never thought of it as amazing art. Just fine. Its good at some moments, however, it can be kinda poor. Enjoyment7/10-I did enjoy it. This is a very enjoyable series. The soundtrack is what I enjoyed the most. The music, is just so enjoyable. Its beautiful. This is a anime also full of comedy. The humor is also what made me enjoy it. However, ive seen much more enjoyable series. There are things I didnt enjoy like terrible pacing, and filler. The enjoyment is good, but not great. Overall7/10-Naruto was a series I enjoyed. However, its VERY overrated. Its called the best anime ever, but its not. The manga is much better.

"I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming hokage, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters. OST and EST in this anime are perfect. Having seen all episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect,and not everybody will like it,but to me it's one of my favorite anime ever..",10,Recommended,"Oct 14, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e5b45c8d81,9,1105
"At first, I thought it'll turn out to be a good anime since it was common. But, I was wrong. The character development isn't as great, since Naruto starts as having a dream to become Hokage and goes through several missions and at the end of the series, what did it turn out to be? Having a dream of becoming Hokage once more. Meanwhile, Sasuke's dream is to kill someone that he's been willing to kill, and at the end what does he do? Search for the person to kill him. And it really does not make sense whatsoever. Ninjas are dreadful creatures of the hidden, but I only watched this just to get more of a favor for ninjas and what do I get? More dislikes for ninjas. My ideal for ninjas was a positive manner until I watched all 220 episodes of this, praying and hoping for it to be at least positive. But I was wrong, there was no hope into continuing it to the second season. But, unlike my selfish self, I decided to. It was the worst decision in my entire life. What I believe is that this anime isn't pointed directly to teenagers. It's pointed directly to little kids that haven't had a taste in good anime or cartoons yet. Character development was poor, story was filled with filters (so much that I got lost), art was decent due to the fighting scenes being all nice and stuff, but the drama in between it... It's annoying. The sound was decent, the enjoyment was alright. Reason being is: The only thing that I was enjoying out of this was my laughter. How funny it is to see someone else being more dramatic than my surroundings in reality. Making me reminiscent. If you're one of those people who takes anime seriously, then you'd probably crash with anger by the time you hit Episode 10-22.

"This is my first review. I hope I don't come off as too much of a jerk. I watched quite a bit of anime before I watched Naruto. I have had some beautiful high points while watching (FMA Brotherhood) and some disappointing lows (SAO). Sadly Naruto was one of those lows. Story: 4 Repeat after me: FILLER EPISODES! This was the worst for me. I usually binge watch anime, so sometimes watching 3+ episodes in a row where the plot made next to no progress became a little mind numbing. Not only that, but the main story line was just kind of boring. I never felt entertained by it. Most of the entertainment I got was either unintentional or just basic slapstick humor. Art: 5 I've seen better and I've seen worse. Sound:7 The sound is great. The themes set the scene well, and the Japanese voice acting is great. I don't have any experience with the dubbed version however. Character: 5 I hate Sakura and Sauske. They are crappy, underdeveloped characters that are whiny and annoying. It's a shame that they are main characters. Naruto is okay. The only characters I liked were Shikamaru and Rock Lee. To directly quote my friend Matt, ""Rock Lee is a badass. Everybody wishes they were Rock Lee."" The only reason he watched Naruto was to cheer on his boy Lee. Enjoyment: 4 Wow. When it comes down to it, I only finished the series to put it on My Animelist.

"Earlier I wrote a review on Naruto, but I deleted it because I felt I didn't go into much detail, now I will review Naruto in broader detail than before. Masashi Kishimoto is one of the many artists to be inspired by highly popular manga/anime series Dragon Ball, like the other two of the ""Big Three""; Bleach and One Piece. Dragon Ball is one of the most influental anime series ever created, a story of a boy named Son Goku who wants to be strong and be there for his friends while defeating the baddies with peserverance, courage,& a sufficent amount of training, simple yet incredibly groundbreak. So here, I'll compare Naruto to Dragon Ball. Story- Naruto follows a very similar formula of those of Dragon Ball Z(as well the same pacing), though one thing should be known, the concept isn't very original: ""A pucky, young boy who longs to become the best ninja there is by becoming the next Hokage, & doing their job better than they've ever dreamed to"". That concept has been used so many times on a Shonen, so Naruto is another coming-of-age anime,& the biggest question, does it deliever? You bet, it may not be too out-of-the-box or defining, but it does give us good settings,& nice built-up though it has many pointless flashbacks, it balances in the themes of friendship, trust, batrial, vengenase,& never giving up very well, like the way Team 7 worked together and truimphed through their missions was something to behold.....but all that takes a backseat after Sasuke disbands from the squad and the series no longer feels like the very entertaining coming-of-age series we used to know but became more like a shallow and boring sob-story. Art and Animation- Nothing to brag about here, the character designs are poorly-drawn, have poor palleting, there's so many errors(but hey, atleast Naruto looks cool),& they're very generic, but it's quite different for the manga as it looks infinitly better,& back on topic: The animation is very choppy, one moment it's fluid but in another it's cheap(compare Naruto vs. Kiba(cheap) to Lee vs. Gaara(fluid)) , it's not the same to say for Dragon Ball as it was well-animated for it's time period although some scenes in there looked cheap. The Opening and Ending sequences look fantastic though. Sound- Top-notch here, top-notch. The voice-actings fit the character's personality very well, DUB AND SUB, but one character's voice-actor I'd like to complain about and that's Sasuke's, the guys who voice him are atleast in their 30's, when Sasuke is 12-years old, Junko Takeuchi(who voices Naruto Uzumaki in the Japanese version ) might have been more fitting for his 12-year old body than Noriaki Sugiyama,& the dialogue is unnatural at times. Othere than that, I applaud the performance. As for the soundtrack, it's one of the best I've ever heard in an anime, they enhance the events,& really fit the atmosphere of the show, really worthy of importing. This is one category Naruto handles better than Dragon Ball. Characters- Well not being as likable or well-defined as Dragon Ball characters, they are still very-well developed(for the most parts), the characterization is handled much like Dragon Ball as they grow physically and mentally. Though a lot of people find them annoying, I don't mind most of them really but I don't agree they're one of the deepest and most well-characterized. One character I feel is complete waste and shouldn't be around is Sakura Haruno, she's the Krillin of Naruto but not as memorial, although she does vouch to be more helpful but she does not fullfill that prophecy untill Shippuden,& she's generally extremely annoying,& she's unbearable to look at. The characters are your typical Shonen archetypes: Naruto is the hyper-active kid yearning to be the best of the best, Sasuke is a rival of Naruto,& Sakura....she's a b!tch and doesn't do much more than lust for the rival. Enjoyable- I'm not gonna lie, I really did enjoy this series, granted it's not even close to being one of the best animes out there, I don't think it's even a candidant for it. The first 100 or so episode are amazing, it has amazing fight choreography, atlmost on par with what you've seen with DBZ, but the rest...not so much, that's where all the fun stops, I'll admit the comedy filler episodes were a breath of fresh air but still. Positives: + Decent story + Stunning Opening and Ending Sequences + Top-notch voice-acting + Top-notch music + Well-defined Characters + Easy to get into + Cool Fight Scenes Negatives: - Overall weak Art and Animation - Not original - Filler Episodes - Overabundant Flash-back scenes - Sakura Haruno Final Verdict: Without the filler episodes, it may have gotten an 8 or 9, but the series is perfect if you wanna get into anime as it's not hard to follow. And if you like Shonens(primarly action-packed ones like DBZ and Yu Yu Hakusho), defintely watch it. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. :)",7,Recommended,"Mar 18, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_98ce615b79,9,4905
"Really good show that is understandable on why it is considered a iconic and great show. Looking back ""Naruto"" is really good and is hard for me to critique though you can see the flaws that are about to happen at any point aka most of ""Naruto Shippuden"" but that will be talked about a other day. The show is about Naruto who is hated because he has a Demon Fox inside of him by the village which is never shown again besides the first episode and no one really hates Naruto for it besides his personality. In the beginning if the show the characters are balanced for the most part even the protagonist feels achievable in some way toward the end. Naruto is about a kid who what to become hokage aka the president of his village but first has to become a ninja because all hokage are strong and smart people which Naruto is neither but he care about to people around him. He train to get stronger with is peers and fight bad guys and is about friendship and mostly determination!!! I liked most of the part the are all well done and can't remember any had one. The music are alright only a couple hit for me but each their own. The land of wave arc an early arc is a Banger!!!",9,Recommended,"May 9, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb2931ae74,9,1177
"(This review is about the original show NOT Shippuden) Look, Naruto is an old school masterpiece. It is often what people describe as a ""hood classic"" Naruto has been cemented as one of the ""big 3"" alongside One Piece and Bleach The series has some of the best written characters in all of anime. Every character is memorable. The story of Naruto is about an orphan named Naruto who wants to become the next Hokage (the leader of his village) and prove to everyone that he can accomplish great things. That's the general concept. The show has some of the best arcs in all of anime. The mist village arc? Banger. The chunin exams arc? Banger. The 4th hokage arc? Banger. The animation team was switched during the forest of death arc and nobody seem to notice. That's how good this show is. The sub and dub are both excellent but the dub is iconic and what everybody grew up watching. Naruto as a character is somebody we all grew up alongside. To watch him go from a child who struggles fighting his peers to taking on literal Gods is..just such a journey. Naruto put anime in the mainstream. It is absolutely something people need to watch or at least know about. You don't have to watch all 200 episodes. You can read the amazing manga, watch the play, or even just watch Naruto explained stuff on YouTube.

"One of the most classic shounen anime of all-time; But this review in particular will focus on the childhood adventures of Naruto Uzumaki and how he navigated his journey on becoming stronger as a ninja. It's a long ride of an anime compared to today's standard but I do recommend it as a starter anime to watch. Animation (6.5/10) - It is good for its time in the early 2000s. But its quality is really showing of its age that it was something published a long time ago. As a casual, it wouldn't be too obtrusive with the viewing experience but there are compilations online showing that in a closer look, the show at times cheaped itself out lol. But still majority of the battle scenes especially were decent so props onto it. Storyline (7.5/10) - I think its major arcs were really good and can hook you up easily. But the thing about Naruto in general is, they have dragging filler episodes. Sometimes its just by an episode, sometimes a whole bulk of it which I think was one of the things that really shaved off some points to this ranking. But still, their main story is enjoyable and really a distinguishable build-up for a greater progression in their series' future. Soundtrack (8.5/10) - Naruto has one of the catchiest and versatile music library I've ever heard on. From the OSTs, sound effects, background music and so. They are really enjoyable and memorable to listen to both inside and outside of the show's context. It ranges from Rock, Traditional Japan, a bit of Japanese Pop and so on. Couldn't complain. Overall - 7.5 out of 10",8,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9b7ac6d0ed,9,1550
"Naruto has undoubtedly left its mark on anime history, boasting numerous iconic moments, immersive world-building, diverse characters, and a unique art style. However, it is not flawless. While the series shines with its varied cast, each with distinct abilities and personalities enriching the narrative, it also faces criticism. Some character motivations are questionable, and inconsistencies plague the series, from character designs to animation quality. Flashbacks disrupt the narrative flow, and with its 220 episodes, Naruto feels excessively long, its pacing sometimes faltering between engaging and sluggish. The inclusion of filler towards the end further dampens the momentum. Despite these drawbacks, Naruto's iconic moments have cemented its place in anime culture, making it a series worth experiencing.",7,Recommended,"Mar 12, 2024",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0bf54e2c8e,9,818
"Naruto is one of the most popular anime series out there. Does it deserve it's praise... well... Let's get started with some things I DISLIKED about the series. -Some episodes are dragged out WAY too long. For example, the dialogue is extended and there are so many sequences when the characters are just staring at each other without accomplishing nothing. -The music wasn't exactly the best. Yes, it is iconic and nostalgic, but a lot of the music sound like one of the fail flute memes you see on the internet that was pretty popular back then. -This is an overdone argument against Naruto but... Sakura really sucks. She is the definition of the wasted potential of a MAIN SHONEN CHARACTER Now that's out of the way, what did I LIKE about Naruto -The characters were so unique. Their abilities were so dissimilar and interesting. Every character got a chance to shine in the original series. -The emotion felt real and raw. Whenever a character went through a hardship throughout the show, you truly felt their pain. -The show had great themes and morals. -The rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke was well blended and executed. Throughout the series, the two rivals start becoming similar and power levels, and it escalates till the final canon arc in the show. -The fathership that Jiraiya has developed with Naruto is sweet. It adds extra character development for both Naruto and Jiraiya. -The power levels were just fine. It established skilled characters, and how Naruto came to overcome them without becoming ridiculous -The fights. Amazing what can I say. Fluid animation, amazing sound effects, and loads of choreography and action when they aren't being dragged out by dialogue and pointless flashbacks Now, do I recommend everyone to watch Naruto Part 1? No. This show is very long, and its successor is even longer. If you have the time and patience to see a slow story develop into something truly lovable and amazing, I would recommend a commitment to watch the series if you're interested to see what the hype is about.",8,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2d42433e52,9,2035
"Okay, to be honest, I can't really say anything because so many people have already reviewed & watched Naruto. However, I can say a couple of things. First, Naruto has an amazing plot line. Yes, there are way too many fillers, however, the plot itself, the ninja, it's all unique to Naruto alone. Second, the characters are awesome. They make you cry and laugh and shout at them for their stupidity. They feel almost real. Third, I just want to say that honestly, a lot of people say Naruto is cliched, and it might be in our eyes, where anime is hugely popular. But when Naruto was first published, it created the cliches - the weak-strong MC ( ect Izuku Midoriya from BHNA ), the two rivals, one naturally talented, one weak ( ect Yuno and Asta from Black Clover ) and the typical cool, black-haired guy ( Ray from The Promised Neverland ).",8,Recommended,"Dec 17, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e80a2c89ec,10,842

"In one paragraph, here's a review from someone who watched Naruto as a newbie but is now a relatively experienced anime fan: Naruto is the first anime that I ever watched. Sure - it's not like any of the current mainstream anime (under 30 episodes). It doesn't have the intellectual intensity, dynamic story line, quick and intense character development, and other factors are common in all great anime today. It's quite long at some times, there are some annoying fillers, and its been going on for over 15 years. But, at least for me, that is what makes it great! See, spending time on this show, watching the characters actually grow as time passes, enjoying the strong moments and sobering through the sad ones is what makes this show appealing to so many young people across the world. Naruto has all the elements of an anime meant to show the beauty of life - not to delve into an intellectual or emotional rollercoaster. I might even say that some of the important decisions that I have made in life may have been inspired by this show. Undoubtedly, I will continue to watch Naruto, Boruto, or whatever comes despite how good or useless it is - think of this as a testament to what this show means to me and so many others.",10,Recommended,"Mar 9, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f042e3a232,10,1230
"When I first starting watching Naruto I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it and thought it was going to be a bad anime, but now I am watching Naruto Shippuden. I always hear that if you watch Naruto and enjoy it your weeb trash but Naruto had a great story, great characters, and it was very enjoying to watch. When Jirayia was introduced it made me think, so is this just the stereotypical perverted anime character? at first I did think it but when Jirayia started teaching Naruto I learned he is much more of a deep character. When Sasuke got the curse mark and became more powerful it made me think ""Is Sasuke now an equal to Naruto?"" due to me not knowing of Naruto being a Jinchuriki. When Naruto first had a the nine-tails chakra leaked out it left me confused. When Gaara was introduced I thought he was going to be a main villian but he turned out to be a Jinchuriki and be converted to the good side. So if you think Naruto is weeb trash watch it and you will most likely enjoy it.",10,Recommended,"Sep 14, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_018b92b88c,10,990
"Ah, Naruto...... The anime that has defined the Shounen battle series for over a decade and then some. Many people love it, many people hate it. Despite all this, Naruto has gone on to be one of the most popular anime of all-time. Here are my thoughts. Naruto Director: Hayato Date Written by: Junki Takegami Creator: Masashi Kishimoto Story (10/10): Many people hate the story of Naruto saying that it's cliche, moves way too slowly, has way too much filler, and is boring, and some of these gripes can be true. So how is it a 10/10? Because of the deep and dark plot that develops over time and it allows for you to truly love the show like I did. Art (7/10); Now, Naruto was my very first anime. So, when I first watched it, I thought that it had the best art ever (10/10). However, looking back, it really doesn't. I am not saying the art sucks. In fact, I think that it was quite good for the early to mid 2000's. But you can't deny there are anime with far better art. (The art in the Manga is much much better). Sound (9/10): I love the music for Naruto. Especially Go by Flow and Haruka Kanata by ASIAN KUNG FU GENERATION. The Raising Fighting Spirit is one of my all-time favorite anime songs. It is beautiful and always got me hyped for the epic battle that was about to occur. The music can get overused at times (obviously since there are 220 episodes) but I still love it and it is fantastic. Character (10/10): Quite arguably the best part of Naruto - the characters. Naruto is a character you might hate at first but you'll grow to love him as the series goes on. He's a knucklehead, a loser, a nobody. No one is his friend and no one respects or acknowledges him. However, he strives to see the best in everyone, no matter what. Over time, almost everyone in Honokagakure (Hidden Leaf Village) respects and acknowledges him. Sasuke is a child ninja prodigy with a dark and deep vengeance against his older brother, Itachi. Sakura is a girl ninja who all she does is cheer for Sasuke and Naruto and get in the way of a fight. Many people hate Sakura because of this. However, she acknowledges her own faults later on (especially in Shippuudden). Kakashi is an excellent character as he turns this group of ""idiots"" into a great ninja team which is no small feat. Kakashi is my 2nd favorite anime/manga character of all time behind Spike Spiegel (Cowboy Bebop). There are tons of other amazing characters as well. Enjoyment (10/10): Despite some of the awful filler, I love Naruto. Always has, always will. It was my very first anime and will always hold a special place in my heart. I will never ever forget Naruto and how much of an influence it has made on me. Overall (9/10): Overall, Naruto is a great anime despite its flaws. Naruto is great, sometimes down, but never out. I do recommend the series, especially if you love Shounen anime. However, skip the filler unless you are a die-hard Naruto fan or you absolutely feel compelled to watch all of an anime including its fillers. 9/10.",9,Recommended,"Jul 7, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b3222634b4,10,3007
"I love Naruto. The plot is almost perfect. The animations are great. The score perfectly underlines every emotion (it almost made me cry (Wind-Akeboshi)). The character development is awesome, they all have a backstory and you really feel with someone because the emotions are brought to you so well that you can understand their feelings. Now the negative side of it. It has an awful amount of Filler-Episodes and that really is annoying. While some are quite enjoyable, most of them are just boring. Also in the middle it can get a bit boring because of these episodes. But in the end all I can say is that you should give it a try because if you know what is a Filler and what isn't, you'll be able to skip all the boring episodes. P.S.

naruto in its self was a good anime it had a solid storyline and great character development but i had to draw the line when they started getting into the filler series. this review will be put into 2 parts Story and Character Part 1: story ok well naruto starts off with a boy of the same name trying to become hokage ( you figure this out because he is saying this 500 times almost every sentence) and he does this by pulling pranks on the leaf village ( of course that will let you become there leader) after being caught he is tied up and sent to NINJA SCHOOL! of course little ninjas need to go to school to and then fails the test to become a ninja. he is convinced to steal a sacred scroll from the hokage by one of his teachers Mizuki ( who only appears in this episode as a villain) after some fights naruto uses shadow clones to beat up mizuki to the brink of friking death he then is told by iruka he past and is now a ninja. as i said before the story is solid but gets repetitive and stupid most of the time character in naruto they like to explain characters backstory through flash backs ( such as narutos and gaaras life) or sakuras friendship with ino this gives you alot to go on with a character so you know what they went through when they were children the only problem i have is ulmost every main character has been abused in some way as a child. overal this anime gets an 8 for good storyline and good character developement,8,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_a93fd0b3b7,10,1447
"Given the voracity of the backlash against the “not-so-bad” rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don’t think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance. So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn’t as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality. The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke’s blandness and Naruto’s charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level. The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed. It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn’t saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto’s Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about.",10,Recommended,"Mar 1, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8dcd2b7eb5,10,3995
"This series starts off rather well, sets the story right and develops everyone's character at a simple level and everyone's ninja powers well. As the anime progresses it becomes crucial that you like Naruto's unwavering and blindly confident character. If not his odd speeches will get annoying and like myself you will often find minor characters a lot more interesting and you wish you could see more of them, or even if they were the main character instead. One of the cons may be that there are so many characters that the inclusion of all of them is difficult. With that, developing those many characters can mess with the pacing of the anime. When some side characters get into fights, the back story of them is then included within the fight which can get annoying and for many of the characters I really don't care about which made me skip most of their back stories. The story it self has a direction but the reader doesn't really have an idea of where it's going. Both good and bad so it's hard to tell what will happen next while knowing the characters are progressing. The animation is fine until fights start, when they move at a high speeds the animation gets quite annoying with faces and bodies getting distorted. It's a hard anime to follow but for some reason I stick with it and is probably my most followed animes as well as being one I know most about. I continue to watch for my liking of the minor characters and ninja fights.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 30, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_381df60e01,10,1449
"Please don't mind my cracky english, please don't cringe. At first I thought writing a review under such a ""huge"" fanbased anime, my review will get lost, but never the less I think Naruto does deserve my opinion. Let me talk about me first. When I was a kid and Naruto was on TV I never was excited about, no- I hated it (maybe because of the disgusting german/english version of the first opening). But as the year passed by me and my sister watched it and give it a try but I can't really remember anything (I kinda knew, what the story was about but I mainly remember shippuden). After Shippuden end and Boruto is crap, Netflix and me decided to bring Naruto back to life (yay). So let me get the facts straight: I have watched Naruto classic with all the fillers once, I just can't remember some episodes in detail. I rewatched the first episodes of Naruto in this week, so my head is kinda fresh. Art: Naruto has his individually style you can't find it elsewhere- it musn't be the perfect masterpiece anime, it can be trash! But if the trash has an individuallity in his character design, I will be pleased. Among all the animes I watched, anime with great story etc, if they look like any other anime, I get bored. So standing ovation for Naruto. Of course you need to have in mind, that Naruto is an old anime. The quality isn't HD, but you get a nostalgic feeling from it. Sound: There are some soundtracks, that are really funny but annyoing at the same time but the openings and endings are sometimes real gold. You never get tired of opening 1, although it might be trash, never you will get bored of opening 2, 3- AH who am I kiding? All the openings are wonderful, my personal favourite of all time: 5. To much feelings in the heighest climax point of Naruto. Story: I will not include those fillers. There are plenty of sites which list all the filler episodes, so don't watch them! The Story follows a main goal from the very beginning. We all know, that our beloved brat Naruto wants to become the best ninja of all time and he wants to be acknowledge by the people, who hated him the whole time. This is basically how it starts, but it is dark from the very beginning- a child abandoned from all people in the village but never he shows his tears to everyone but change it into hard work. Altough Naruto started the lonley boy cliche(but hey, he started it first). But the story will follow a second main goal, which gets more into the center while being in the climax of the show (not going into detail). What makes the show great: You will notice, that every character which there is, shape the whole plot. This is something, that not every author manage to do- to create a whole world based of his characters and their actions. I compared Game of Thrones with Naruto. Everyone was hyped by the complicated story just based by a lot of characters and I looked at them thinking they could have watched Naruto and they would like it, but they don't watch it because it is a ""cartoon"". But lets go back to my comparison: Naruto did it first. I watched some other great shounen too, eg One Piece which is also very great, but only Naruto anime has a connecting with all characters within the show without loosing the connecting. You will see that you never wonder where character xy might be right know, because they exist in your mind already. It is so deep, that you understand every single step they make, the sadnees they feel, the anger that they keep in. What was annyoing?: 1)Based on Story and Character alone would made it a 10, but regardless I have skipped the fillers or not, they exist. Fillers are always bad and always annyoing. It is better to wait for a new episode than to see some unnecassary content. 2)Flashbacks. Every time there is a emotional deep fight or conversation there are flashbacks. It is a common cliche which is cringy. Overall: Those two points are points, that ruined a great show, but I couldn't find the sectore in which I could have prove my score at the end. Story 10 Art 9 Sound 9 Characters are 10 Enjoyment? 5, I want to give less but it seems unfair because I am rewatching it, so how I am not enjoying? Overall I cant give a 10, but 8 seems maybe to good for this anime. Again, I think Naruto is a great anime which I loved the most. But it is annoying to.",8,Recommended,"Jul 2, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1ceb1d1291,10,4319
"Naruto. An anime that probably everyone has heard of. I first began watching this as a child and grew accustomed to the bright and crazy tale of Naruto Uzumaki, but it was soon lost in my past. After picking it up again, I was stunned as to how much I could now appreciate it after reading the manga and becoming a reasonably seasoned anime viewer. I soon became re-absorbed into the world of the shinobi, with Naruto Uzumaki the number one knuckle head ninja of the leaf. The story in inclusive and beautifully told, the art is stunning and cheerful but knows when to bring in deeper colours for the more saddening areas. The character development is what I found most interesting though. As expected for a 220 episode anime, there is a lot of character development, but what made me even more interested was the fact that characters that are side-characters or have a smaller role in the tale, their background and stories are told with just as much depth as the main characters. Overall, I found Naruto not just a fun and exciting anime, but a beautiful work of art that even had me close to tears. I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of ninjas, japan, serious storyline, with a lot of fun on the side.",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_0ca63adf15,10,1224
"Oh, Naruto. I want to give this series a higher rating since it is the first anime series I have ever watched and is actually the one that helped me decide I should continue watching more. However, with the sheer amount of high quality content out there, Naruto comes off overrated, even with its few redeemable qualities. Story – 5 Without discussion of how events unfold in Shippuden, Naruto shows the early stages before the time skip of when 3 ninja have to individually develop their skills and learn the values of teamwork. I must say the story starts off excellent – there’s discussion of the ninja rules, hopeless battles that are turned around by the protagonists through tact, and introductions of characters that build them up to be extremely threatening. The coolest part of the Naruto story is how ninjas are constantly tested by their ability to see through deception. That being said, the Naruto series is almost half filler (I’m not exaggerating) and beats to death the value of friendship, but in a more “telling” way than “showing” way. At the climax of the story, viewers are supposed to feel the tension of a friendship falling apart between Naruto and Sasuke. However, while the two did have fun times, they rarely shared personal moments or really exhibited their friendship towards each other. They only enjoyed each other in a misery-loves-company way because of how they both grew up alone. For me, the strong bond I was supposed to see simply wasn’t there. Art – 3 The art improves in Shippuden, but the quality of the animation and the jagged uncomfortable drawings of the characters is really off-putting. This is a combination of Kishimoto’s originally slipshod art skills (it gets better) at the beginning of the series and just poor animation. None of the characters look good proportionally, especially the women. The scenery and Konoha itself are really nothing special either, and most of the background is painfully simple in design. Background characters look like almost no effort was put into drawing them. Still, I suppose I have seen worse. Sound – 6 The music is fitting to the anime, but nothing besides the battle soundtracks are really anything special. Compare the soundtrack of Naruto to masterpiece shows like Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bepop, or Puella Magi. The opening themes are nothing special but do have some very enjoyable tunes with JRock standouts like ROCKS, Yura Yura, Haruka Kanata, and Fighting Dreamers. While fitting, the soundtrack rarely evokes the intense emotion required of the scene. This also improves in Shippuden. Character – 3 Boy, oh boy, character development is such a disaster on this show I don’t even know where to begin. The show throws a large ensemble cast at you during the Chunin exams, almost ALL of who add nothing to the story and become complete background throughout the series. The series is also the best at building up characters to seem like they are either strong or have significant plot impact only to forget about them entirely. Examples are Sakura, one of the main characters, who doesn’t exhibit a single unique skill throughout the series (and while she gets better in Shippuden skill-wise, she is given almost no screentime) and is in the story because it needs a damsel in distress. The rest of the kunoichi in the series are no better – We don’t even know Tenten’s personality, Hinata’s around for her crush on Naruto and is just a weaker version of Neji, and Ino is the same character as Sakura except with one skill that is extremely difficult to use when fighting on her own. The fifth hokage, Tsunade, is brought in as the strongest ninja in the village, but her skills are rarely showcased either – except that one time she beats up a guy who already had NO ARMS. The same goes for her teammate Jiraiya, another legendary ninja who barely gets a chance to show his stuff, his one time in battle being so drugged by Tsunade he was essentially useless. Little else is shown about the other characters’ pasts, male or female. We know that Naruto and Sasuke had it rough as orphans and the Hyugas have a complicated family structure, but we are to assume that most of the other characters live normal lives otherwise. There’s no complexity in their pasts, and very little happens to them throughout the show to shape them into better people, unless it’s a villain who miraculously got turned around by Naruto’s words about how friendship is important (if only it was that easy in real life, eh?). The one true gem of Naruto’s cast is Shikamaru, whose sheer intelligence and developed leadership after the chunin exam makes him impressive and exciting to watch. Overall, however, what One Piece accomplishes for over a hundred characters, including a boat, Naruto fails to for a dozen. Overall – 6 While Naruto is heavily flawed in most ways, looking at it as a whole is quite different. In the same way books like Twilight are page turners, Naruto keeps you on your toes and each arc is genuinely interesting even if the quality of its storytelling is bland. There is plenty of action, maybe so much action that it detracts from all other aspects of the story. Nevertheless, it’s a show about ninjas geared towards teenage boys, and in that respect, it does well. The series presents itself as an amazing gateway anime, and it certainly is still worth watching.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 25, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f615dfedb6,10,5362
"SPOILER FREEEE!!!!!!!!!!! “Those that break the rules and regulations are scum. But those who abandon their comrades are worse than scum. If I'm going to be called scum either way, I'd rather break the rules! And if that's not being a proper shinobi, then I'll destroy that idea!” Most people who have watched anime have seen Naruto at one point, the same goes for One Piece. For me, the face that i've been watching the show for so long kept me pulled in to keep watching when i started the series beginning to end for the first time. For other people who didn't grow up with the show this same ""pull"" may not apply, especially for the first couple of episodes the show starts off rather slow just as most other anime or shows. Nevertheless i'd still recommend Naruto to anyone especially as a starter anime. Story (7/10) The story is quite unique in a way – it was set in an entirely different world which, at the same time, resembles real life situations such as wars, laws, conflicts, vengeance, hatred, loyalty, patriotism, and friendship. Although some may say it may resemble other anime, but the setting and the situation of this one is quite different, being in a world of ninjas and all. As mentioned earlier, they ingeniously designed each episode to make your mind wonder what will happen next whereas in psychology, they will feed you what you desire and before you become fully satisfied, they will take it away from you so that you will want to see what will happen in the next episode. Yet, there are too many fillers and for a while all they do is go on mission after mission. There doesn’t seem to be progress at times. Art (8/10) The art is about average, but depends on when you are watching it. If you were watching in 2014/2015 you would probably rate the art lower as to someone who watched it in 2004. The original run started in September 21, 1999, so to take it in consideration the art is fairly well down for it’s time compared to many other shows out there. Sound (8/10) The soundtrack is really good. Soundtrack is good and very diverse, and there are certainly a few very awesome tracks, but I like the original better than Shippuuden because it suffers from poor timing and poor track placement, and the OST overall lacks the same sense of character that united all of the tracks. Great soundtracks would be Loneliness, The Rising Fighting Spirit and Sadness and Sorrow. Now overall, if you watch dubbed, in my opinion it’s horrible, but in Japanese it’s not bad. Character (9/10) The character development is great. It takes a lot of time to get to know each character but in about 220 eps you pretty much get to know a little bit about everyone. They take 2-3 eps just to introduce a person or they add that person to the mission, so we get to know more about them. For example, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura are the characters you learn the most about in the original series, but say they add Neji to the team mission. During that mission which is usually about 2-3 eps you learn a lot about him. Another example would be during the exam, Rock Lee fights Gaara and it take 5+ eps but you learn so much about them. Now, I personally don’t like all the flashbacks but I do think they are valuable to learn about a character. Enjoy (7/10) The enjoyment was average for me. Usually, I find myself skipping parts after a while because sometimes it would be boring. There would be a fight but that fight takes like 5 eps because of flashbacks, which is valuable sometimes, but not when it’s a character who will only be there for those episodes. Take Sasuke’s arc for example when everyone is chasing him, the fights were awesome back there was a flashback every fight they got into. It personally takes the enjoyment away for me at times. . Overall (8/10) Overall, Naruto has its ups and downs. The storyline is deep, with a plot that follows the manga. Naruto also has several filler arcs which lead away from the main plot. The music is great, and matches up with scenes well. The characters of Naruto, are well thought out.. they all have details about them and are interesting to watch. Animation is excellent. Fights are very detailed, you know how far away the characters are, and there are great camera angles.",8,Recommended,"Oct 14, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_38b56005e9,10,4244

"Okay, so I was just getting into anime when I came across Naruto. I know that most people start off with animes like Naruto, One Piece, Attack on Titan, and etc and then they move on to different anime and get a general taste in what genre they prefer. What surprised me though is that this anime has always been my absolute favorite, and although I didn't grow up with Naruto like a lot of other people, for me the same feelings come across through watching the show. The world they live in is charming, but can be quite chaotic at times. Each character has their own unique design that complements who they are and their personalities. Each character is different and it is interesting to see what being a ninja means to them. I think the thing I like most about this series is that each character has their own story and preference and how characters grow throughout the series. Like, take Naruto for example, he has always wanted to become Hokage (leader of village) to be acknowledged but he realizes that to be Hokage means to gain the trust of the village. It is amazing to see how much Naruto cares about his friends' well being and how he creates new bonds with the people he meets to be honest it is inspiring to me. And yes I do realize that there is a lot of filler but if you don't care about those episodes than just skip it and once you finish all the canon episodes go back and watch the filler. Overall Naruto is a great series for anyone but I recommend it if you are new to anime or if you just love Shonen battle series",10,Recommended,"Mar 7, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1f52034466,10,1539
"This is not a professional review, it is a rant. All I want to say is this is one of the most dragged out animes I have ever watched. 30% new content, 30% recaps & flashbacks, 40% fillers. One fight can take up to 8 episodes easily and unnecessarily. I hated how the anime plays 3-5 fights simultaneously, it just kills the hype completely. Story seems amazing (which is why I managed to watch the whole thing). Art is complete crap and the sense of positioning is buggered. One second the two fighters are 3 meters apart, the other second they are 50 meters apart. Yeah this anime came out 453 BC, but Dragonball is older and I don't think I complained as much about its art.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 4, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_fb874488fd,10,676
"In America, Naruto is without a doubt the most overrated, overhyped anime of my generation. Everyone has heard of Naruto. However, since I didn’t start seriously watching anime until a few years ago, I didn’t grow up on this anime like many others did. The nostalgia factor isn’t there for me, so I feel like I’m able to give a non-biased review. Needless to say, because of the endless praise I’d heard my friends and peers give the anime, my expectations were extremely high. Unfortunately, I found Naruto to be a vast disappointment. I hate to admit the only reason I pushed past episode 20 was so my opinion of the show would be more “valid” in the eyes of my youngest brother, who adores Naruto. If you’re a fan of Naruto, I’m sorry—this review won’t be a kind one. Story: 3 I didn’t care much for the story. I wouldn’t necessarily say that the story itself was bad, only that I couldn’t find myself becoming invested as it progressed. I will say, that the main selling point of the story is supposed to be that Naruto is excluded by his peers because of the fox spirit inside him, and aims to become the strongest to prove them wrong. However, by the Chunin exams, it’s perfectly clear that those who don’t like him dislike him because he’s annoying. I found it hard to blame them. Art: 7 The art of this show is probably the thing I think the highest of. I appreciated the use of color, especially the pop of Naruto’s orange jumper and the pink of Sakura’s hair. The character designs were one of the main highlights for me, especially the naturally proportioned bodies of the girls; it’s typical in a lot of shōnen anime and manga that the girl characters will have slim waists and large breasts, but here the bodies of characters looked rather realistic. Points for that, Naruto. Sound: 7 I had no issues with the voice acting (I watched this English subbed). I did find some of the music used in the show to be a little annoying, particularly a piano riff used in the background when people were fighting. Characters: 3 This is where Naruto suffers the most. The main character is perhaps the worst offender: while they were aiming for the “lovable idiot” character type, they missed the mark. While he is, indeed, an idiot, he is far from loveable—he is arrogant, annoying, obnoxious, and arguably selfish. Whenever I bring this up to fans of the show, they always tell me “He’s so much better in Shippuden” or some variation of telling me to wait for Shippuden. In what world is it feasible to wait 220 episodes from the main character of a TV show to become likeable, let alone bearable? Don’t get me wrong, he has his moments, but for 90% of the time he was an utter nuisance. The rest of the characters aren’t much better—most of them are one-dimensional and paper thin. The biggest flaws came from the female characters, whose sole characteristic the majority of the time was their interest in a male character. Enjoyment: 3 Naruto does have its moments. However, I feel it’s fair to say my enjoyment was relatively low. Since there didn’t seem to be a category fit for me to mention this, I’ll put it here: I hate toilet humor. Despise it. So, when there were scenes where Naruto was on the toilet suffering from diarrhea or accidentally farted during a fight, or characters were seen vomiting for comedic effect, I didn’t find it funny, but rather eye-rollingly annoying. I have a hard time believing this is the same show people are praising so much. This is it? I can understand the nostalgia factor that most have, but for others like my brother who watched it within the past year or so, I’m surprised. Knowing that this was the show that made him hate on the likes of My Hero Academia and One Piece irritates me in a way I can’t properly express. Despite feeling a low-level anger whenever I watch it, I’ll finish this damn series… I’ll watch every last canon episode, for this and Shippuden… for the spiteful fact of strengthening my argument and being able to back up my reasoning of disliking it, so my brother can’t tell me my opinion or argument is invalid. Overall: 5 5/10 might change as I continue on. It’s over-hyped and over-rated, lower your expectations if you’re wishing to watch it. I recommend watching something else, particularly a better shōnen like One Piece, My Hero Academia, Demon Slayer, or Jujutsu Kaisen.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 2, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_46d10e3626,10,4352
"The series would be alot more entertaining if it got to the point and stuck to the storyline. Too much of the series is made up of fillers that get old fast, while all the over exighted Sasuke fangirls want to know about is whatever happens to their preacious dickhead Uchiha, etc. The beginning is boring but it gets much more interesting later in the game. It also gets way better once you get past the enormous brick of fillers and into shippuden. But I'll warn anyone who hasn't seen it right now, the fandom is huge and intimidating. Don't be a noob.

"Let's face it, this is a good shonen anime. The second anime that I had watched in my life (first being Dragonball). Overall I can say, it was a fun experience until I discovered panties, moe, and Evangelion. There are flamers and there are fanboys whose list also include bleach and One Piece and such other shonen animes of the same caliber. Enough about the basics let's get into the review. Story - Not what everyone wants, but it WORKS. That's the most important part, it WORKS. It's nice and interesting, doesn't have to be as long as it is. Fillers, not so much, i like how they get into the side characters, but there are better ways to do it then just send them on a mission together. Not so much romance going on. Would've made things more interesting. good at explaining things that happened in the past as such. Can't approve of all the plot devices used. Some are too cheap and i would have preferred if the story was darker and centered around a sadistic Naruto instead of a headstrong mentally handicapped person. I give it a 7 - Not bad, did it's job for a shonen and the main plot line is still followable. Art - Not bad but I've seen a few freeze frames that made me Lol. Not much ecchi or ero shot/Special Effects, so i can't say much. It's pretty basic. 7 - little things here and there. Not phenomenal, passes. Sound - Again, very basic. fighting sounds were also basic. Music was good. Voice acting, like able. Didn't launch any voice actors into fame. 7 - nothing more to say. Character: There weren't really any characters i truly disliked in the series. Stupid trolls flaming something they don't understand, fanboys are obsessed based on their primal instincts. Both have little to no grip on what makes a character and that's what makes them the animals they are. The villains appealed more to me than the main characters. They had more darker, complicated back stories that i sympathized with and had taken a liking to. There were way too many characters than there needed to be. Either have them be an iconic background character or make them a main character. You can only have so much in the supporting role. Their pasts are very basic and I'm not going to review it on a level of a person who has seen some deep stuff and is very experienced with those sort of tropes. The people watching this should be little kids that should be educated on these sorts of story structure and understand how they work. This anime does what is needed. And the lack of character depth is probably to appeal to a younger audience as well as well as release as many games, toys, and cosplay costumes as possible. That fact however doesn't come on as strong though. I had some favorites which means this deserves nothing less than a 7, some bad some good, balances it out. If i had taken out all the characters i disliked i would've given it at least an 8. Enjoyment - Did I enjoy it? No, this differs from viewer to viewer and to me I wouldn't have the attention span to stay in my chair to watch this. Instead I'd be watching this while doing something else in the background, not even caring to read the subs. This is something I'd give to my younger siblings to get them started on anime. They would love this stuff, and it'll prepare them for better animes by setting the bar very low on the first time. Watching a masterpiece as the first anime, really takes the luster away from the animes you would have enjoyed if you hadn't watched this first. So always watch this first before you go into Code Geass. 6 - and this won't affect the overall score this is completely unrelated. This is indeed better than Bleach (a lukeworm anime that excels no direction in particular, read my review for it). Overall grade - 7 I think it's great for it to be as overrated as this is. It's basically the front gate for newcomers in to the anime universe, and being the position as it's in, i'd prefer to have it as overrated as possible. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for this anime. I wish it luck in it's future stories. Let the little kids have fun, we can enjoy it from time to time in nostalgia, but I don't recommend it to anyone who wants deep story. If you don't like it, take it to a youtube video. ~LordPlagus777",7,Recommended,"Aug 14, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_de2d54425e,11,4228

"Naruto is one of the most well known anime of all time. Many people love it, many people hate it. I love it. Yes, it may be overrated, but I give it a 10 cuz its one of my favorite animes. Ever since I started watching it, I got hooked. I am still crazy about it. It may have fillers, has flaws, and the characters can get annoying, its still a lovable series. I wil try not to include spoilers. Naruto is about a boy named Naruto Uzamaki who had no friends. He was always alone, and sad. He never understood why everyone hated him. The truth is, the Nine Tailed Fox is inside of him. 12 years ago, this creature attacked the hidden leaf village. The 4th hokage sealed the monster inside Naruto. Thats why everyone hates him. Naruto's main goal is to become hokage and make everyone see how great he is. He starts training as a genin Ninja, and joins Team 7, with the leader being Kakashi Hateo, a Jonin Ninja. Naruto's two teammates are Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haurno. Sasuke is a grumpy, nasty boy from the Uchiha Clan, and is out of revenge. Sakura Haurno is from the Haurno Clan I guess? She has a huge crush on Sasuke and hates Naruto. Naruto and his team go on mission's, train, and go in the Chunnin Exam. Naruto's quest now begans as he encounters death, lost, and betrayl. While the series may have fillers, they arent to bad. Episodes 136-220 is all filler, so episode 135 is the last canon episode. Most of the fillers do get in the way, but some are funny and enjoyable. This anime does have a good soundtrack. It has one of the greatest soundtracks in all of anime. The music is amazing! The opening songs are very catchy and lovable. When it comes to fight scenes, Naruto doesnt fail with that. Most of Naruto is fight scenes. The fight between Naruto and Neji was amazing. It was exiting, and I didnt expect what happened.(Im not going to spoil that). The fight with Naruto and Sasuke was epic, and it was like 6 episodes. It was very intense. This anime really gets you hyped when it comes to pure action. This doesnt mean this anime isnt funny. You will get plenty of laughs from all the characters. Naruto may be funny with his foolishness, and his Sexy no Jutsu, but there are fillers that will make you laugh really hard. Like the filler with Naruto wanting to know what Kakashi looks like without the mask, it was so funny how they tried to do it. Its also funny when Sakura gets pissed and beats the shit out of everyone. The funnist moments are when Jiayria is being a pervert. I also love the characters. I always Gaara. He is pure badass. He has a amazing character development, design, and personality. I love his Sand Jutsu, which makes him so strong. I also really like Itachi. Besides from Gaara, Itachi is the most badass character you can find in the original series. But almost all the characters are enjoyable and memorable. A few like Ma Sakura, Shino, and Komamahru are just annoying. But the character development is still good, mostly for Naruto. One thing I dont like is how half of the series is based of Sasuke. Naruto is the star. He should be the really important one. But is Saskue that everyone worries about. Like everyone is after him, he dissapers, he leaves the leaf village. Most of the anime is all Sasuke. But I still love the anime either way. This anime isnt to sad. But there are some moments that are so sad. Like when Ikura went to save Naruto from danger. I almost cried when I saw it for the first time. When the 3rd Hokage died it was also very upsetting. I cried every time. This anime also has sad music that gets me upset. This anime can get you in the feels. I really think this anime is really good. I always enjoyed it. I have rewatched this anime a few times, and it still never gets old. I do understand why people might not like it, and thats okay. Yes, its overrated, but I still give it a 10 cuz I love it. Plz dont write that im stupid on my comments just cuz I gave it a 10 and called it overrated. It is. But im one of those lovers. If your new to anime, this is a good choice. If your a older anime fan, then I cant recommend it. Its one of my favorite animes, and I will always love it.",10,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_c4a177c581,11,4163

"ok, let's be honest, most people who are into anime have heard in some way shape or form about naruto that it's either the greatest anime ever or its garbage. well it's neither of those things so let's talk about it. naruto is about a young ninja's journey to become the leader of his village someday and we get to see that growth through part one and then into shippuden (of which i will write my review on it later) pro's of naruto 1. excellent characters - the thing about naruto compared to alot of other anime's out there who have well written characters and sometimes even very well written and also relatable. naruto has both. most of the characters in naruto have extremely unique personality's that will appeal to a wide arrange of people and some might even be able to relate to more then one character. and more often then not if your end up liking this anime you'll probably be thinking at some point ""why don't i get to this such and such character more"" it happens alot and sadly there are a couple characters i wish we would have gotten to see less of (sakura) and more of (neji,hinata, asuma). to go along with their unique personalitys they are come with their own unique skill sets making most of the characters to be special and strong in certain area's (except sakura, no i am not trying to trash this character i actually like sakura but she doesn't do much in part one despite the fact she's the main heroine). 2.solid fighting - the fighting scenes in the show do start off fairly slow but they do get much better with each episode to show how the characters fighting and skills improve. 3. excellent storytelling - there is a solid main story here that is always pretty on target to reaching a certain point and it does keep you invested throughout the show. even though there is alot of filler (AHAHAHAHA) even some of that is interesting and somewhat needed 4. soundtrack -the feels cons 1.filler -iam going to go ahead and say that i don't hate filler but naruto does WAY OVER DUE IT. some filler is needed in order to explain many of the backstorys with certain characters which is fine but more often then you'll feel as if its a complete waste of time 2.flashbacks -way to many in part one, we get it this certain thing happend we don't need to see it 5 fucking times 3.artwork -in some episodes its great others not so much 4.wasted potential of a main character -SAKURA HARUNO 5.some parts could be explained more in part one but are just kinda swept aside. overall this is a good anime, one of my favorites because i grew up with it, i reccomend everyone at least TRY it and if you don't like it you don't like it.",9,Recommended,"Sep 22, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_461329371e,11,2647
"This is probably the worst shounen I've ever seen. Story: 3/10. Art: 2/10. Easily the worst animated shounen I've seen. Sound: 2/10. Nothing of note here. Since the series itself is like 9001 episodes long you can probably find some good openings or endings though. I do remember Ending 4 making me want to rip my ears off, it is abhorrent. Character: 2/10. Sasuke and Naruto are basically the dumbed-down version of Griffith and Guts. They have no chemistry, and their 'friendship' consists of Sasuke getting all the girls to look at him and Naruto expressing his envy every five seconds. Sakura is just a third-wheeler who gets in the way and, oh boy, is she annoying af. The only good characters are probably Rock Lee, Orochimaru and Kakashi. Rock Lee actually puts in hard work and strives to be the best; he doesn't have asspull demon powers to guide him through everything, and he's just a likable guy. Orochimaru is actually intimidating and has an ounce of intrigue to his character. And Kakashi, well, there's not much to hate about him. He has a cool design and is pretty chill. Other than that, the rest of the cast is basically what you get when a 13 year old writes a 2deep4u shounen. Edgy dudes like Gaara and Sasuke make me hate rival tropes in shounen. Enjoyment: 1/10. Do you want to go through endless filler, flashbacks and slow paced episodes with horrible artwork? Me neither. Overall: 1/10. I'd rather watch Fairy Tail, and I despise Fairy Tail.",1,Not Recommended,"Sep 18, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_159c451d3d,11,1467
"Alright first review I've ever done, so I'm going to tackle a show near and dear to my heart. Naruto For many anime fans this was the gateway anime that entered them into this culture. It was flashy, fun, and definitely appealed to a great many with it's over the top action. Looking back however, it doesn't have the gleam as it once did. Story: 6 The story has a simple premise in common with many shonen, group of kids with special powers go and defeat the bad guys and save the world or town. Then more bad guys are introduced and true motives are revealed and it starts to become a jumbled mess. In first 6 seasons of the show( minus any filler), the story was clean, simple, and engaging to an extent; come the start of the filler seasons, the story begins to needlessly complicate then come shippuden everything falls apart into a jumbled mess full of plot holes. Art: 6 The art in Naruto is vibrant (though a little flat at points) and makes good use of color palette and the various villages have pretty interesting designs. The animation though is solid at best and downright pitiful at worst .Shippuden improves on this factor. (Sometimes) Sound:9 Now this in my opinion is what made Naruto stand out among the other ""Big Three"" The opening and closing themes are almost always catchy and the background music has a distinctly Japanese feel that always complements the mood. Character: 6 Now here is definitely the most controversial aspect of Naruto. Lets start with the main Three Naruto: He's your typical loudmouth, hyperactive shonen protagonist. Though he does go from being bratty to a more typical hero, there's virtually nothing about him that stands out from other characters, except maybe his fashion sense. Sasuke: He's the token cool mysterious black-haired character who is rivals with the protagonist. He's not really interesting and his turn to darkness is seen from a mile away. He just gets worse throughout the series. There's really not much to say about his character, he exists to serve as character development and plot. ( And fangirl-bait) Sakura: She's the absolute worst of the bunch. This character mearly serves the role of being the ""girl"" on the team and having a crush on the cool kid. Even though she did well on the ninja exams, she shows absolutely zero capability in combat and sits on the sidelines waiting for one of the male leads to rescue her. She has no real character traits other than ""Tsundere"" until season 5 where she becomes aware of her own uselessness. I blame the author for her lack of character, most of his female characters are atrociously written. That being said, she does develop a personality and becomes extremely useful in Shippuden and actually becomes likable. For the other characters it's hit or miss, some bring something new to the character archtypes, though most are flat though with little depth. That being said, there is substantial character development with almost all of the characters during Shippuden and 5+ on. Plus, since this anime is so huge by the time you finish it the characters become like family to you. Enjoyment:5 Naruto's battles are extremely fun to watch the the author gets extremely creative with his ninja abilities and powers. However, with the amount of flashbacks and fillers, you won't be seeing too many exciting moments. The dialog progressively gets better with each season, so you have that to look forward to. (Gets a solid 10 for nostalgia rewatch value.) Overall: 6 Naruto is not a terrible anime, but it's certainly not a great one either. Its cliche and stereotyped, but it's enjoyable, goofily bad, and manages to bring fond memories back. If you are the type of person who likes creative powers and rare but memorable fight scenes( and has a ton of time on their hands) this anime is for you. If you are someone looking for emotionally deep characters and stunning plot, might not be the best choice.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 19, 2014",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6af05ab958,11,3920
"IT IS POPULAR FOR A REASON! I just re-watched this show two months ago, so I'd thought I should review it. When I first watched it years ago, I remember gradually falling in love with it. Asides from Yu Yu Hakusho, this was the second anime that grabbed my attention. I really did not like it at first. I thought it was boring, sexy/harem- jutsu annoyed me, and Haku's gender confused me! I think what grabbed me to this show was Zabuza's final speech. That whole scene was brilliantly emotional, and I automatically became hooked. That being said, it takes a while to fall in love with this show (it starts off really good though), and then it takes another while to fall out of love with it. But do I recommend this anime? Yes, that is considering you have the time to watch, you are patient, and realize that there is another series (Part II) after this. The show does not really end. The soundtrack for this anime is amazing! In my opinion it's unique, not classical, and better than what you expect! That's all I can say about it. The art gets better as the story progresses especially the fighting sequence. Unfortunately, I cannot say this about Shippuden (Naruto: Part II). As for the characters, after you watch a lot of anime, you realize how unoriginal they are. There is nothing special about them. However, when I first watched it, I remember having a very difficult time deciding who my favorite character was going to be because I thought all of them were amazing. Now, I cannot stand most of the characters. Naruto: the main character is alright. His perseverance is very admirable. The only problem I have with him is that he is dull-witted; but even that is a gateway to bring humor into the show. I’m glad he is the hero of this series because he does bring the good emotional side of everyone. Sasuke: He is the reason why I hate characters that are so emotional. That ""cool-dark"" vibe does not appeal to me. It is over used! He is the definition of a psychotic masochistic-emotional loser! I just want to slap him. It gets worse as the episode goes on. I did even not understand how all the girls love him. Speaking of the girls, how come they are all ridiculously vacuous? Saukura: If she is the smartest out of her classmate, there is something really wrong with the people there. All she does is love Sasuke. She is mean to everyone else. Furthermore, there are moments that she does have character development, BUT right afterward she is just annoying again: A FAIL of a heroine. Haku- he is not a main character, but I remember having an argument with my family about whether he was girl or a boy. It really did start a riot in my house. It was a mind boggling moment in my life. I swear! This was before I realized that Japanese anime always has at least one male character that speaks and looks like a girl. However, it is still surprising that the English dub kept the female voice. As for the other characters such as: Neji, Hinata, Kakashi, Gaara, Lee, Choji, (and so many more!)are developed really nicely. I love them! All of them have similar traits to Naruto, but they are different and beautiful Lastly, I want to speak about Shikamaru! The laziest character of ‘em all. To be honest, I had never seen a character like him before when I started watching, so he fascinated me (now I know, there are so many of them). I feel like out of all the characters, he had the best character development even though he was not a part of all the episodes. It was done perfectly as well. The laziness still lived on, but the maturity starts revealing itself. He is what you call intelligent, not Sakura Lets just say, as cliche as the characters are, their (heartbreaking) storyline makes the show. What do I hate about Naruto? It doesn't end. There are so many fillers (pointless episodes that do not relate to the storyline). A person can only watch so much! I must have been really stupid, because when I started this show, I LOVED the filler. However, it took so much out of me that I could not even watch Shippuden. If you are going to watch the show, do not watch the fillers! DO NOT WATCH IT! The only fillers that you should watch are the ones that you like. Research the episodes before you begin. I loved episode 101: Kakashi's real face. It was a question I was thinking about since the beginning of the anime, so it was interesting to know that the characters thought about it too! And the Neji's curry episode was funny as well. If you are a Hinata, Neji, Sjhikamura, Kiba, Ino, (or whoever), there are specific episodes related to them, so just watch those only, nothing more. There are more than 100 fillers I believe, soo..... don't. watch. all of them. Overall, this is only a review for Part I.. believe me, if I had to talk about the manga or Shippuden, the rage would ooze out of your computer screen. Okay, not really, but I would have more negative things to say even though I like it.",7,Recommended,"Mar 30, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3b396faef9,11,4930

"This really isn't that great of a show, and if there was less focus on the side characters (like what happens in Shippuden) then it probably wouldn't even be tolerable to watch at all. The world-building and soundtrack carry the show on their back. Naruto is the main character, and one of the most naturally gifted/talented/OP MCs of all time, entirely while the show tries to pose him as some weak underdog. The underdog that's never lost once. There are 2 entire seasons of filler episodes after the actual Finale of the show that aren't canon (or at least any progression gained is lost afterward, and the main plot doesn't move an inch) Overall I would never recommend this show to anyone, it's definitely one of the bottom-tier shounen anime. The only reason to watch Naruto is if you've already seen it, and you have enough nostalgia for it to muscle your way through, or you want to watch it purely because of its legendary status and prevalence in media.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 6, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6863132a25,11,963
"Naruto was the first anime that I've watched that drew me in of which I was aware of it being an anime. Due to that, I tend to consider Naruto the first anime I've watched, despite this not being true due to the fact that I've watched a bunch of other anime before it, but rather, because due to it I've gotten interested in the medium of anime as a whole. I've never really considered Naruto to be incredibly good, but I remember REALLY enjoying it and being into it. I really enjoyed the powers of the characters and the diversity and just the plain multitude of possibility of powers that can be used, as well as for once that a cartoon is trying to present some tragic stories/backstories to their characters. It was, ironic to a lot of the traits Naruto has, is because of the fact it was a serious story. The first of its kind I've ever had experienced. But as Naruto went on and as I got older, Naruto (the franchise) became an obvious botch, where only about 50% of the content moved the story forward due to fillers. But what is Naruto at its core? Well, Naruto, at its highest points, is a story where the world presents some characters of whose motivations and capabilities are explained quite well, where you can have a character wanting to seek a high political position because they want to be accepted by all the people that have ostracized him through his entire life, or a character that is incapable of learning any sort of special power and decided to train himself physically to a ridiculous extent, just to prove that they can be as strong as everyone else, or a character that decided to become someone's tool for war, simply because said someone were the only parental figure willing to raise them. A lot of the characters have very strong motivations for what they are doing, and that makes them noteworthy and memorable, despite all their annoying/artificial personality traits, the things they've been through and their motivation for the direction they're moving towards is engaging and makes their personality mishaps pretty easy to ignore. Naruto at the core of what it tried to be is a meaningful story about people trying to get somewhere in life and how they've suffered. Which is a hard thing to execute, presenting a lot of characters, with different motivations, goals and stories. With all the shortcomings Naruto has, it is hard not to admit that its story was ambitious in the beginning, where a lot of the backstories the characters have been presented with would be enough to create an entire story arc or series just for that specific archetype. This ambition is what made it noteworthy in the beginning. Naruto tried to present a lot of stories at the same time, present a lot of ideas, without really focusing on a singular entity too much which worked both in its favor and in its detriment. What was in its favor was what I've already praised it for, the story at the highest point. And the detrimental part was the fact that it has no idea where to go and it tried to present too many characters and ideas. It kept creating powers, characters, motivations and other such things, but as the series progresses, especially in the sequel, the powers simply don't matter and the strategy behind the fights simply starts fading, because of the sheer multitude of powers, and the characters also start taking the back seat and being irrelevant, due to how many of them are currently. In this series however, the effect of this isn't really felt, but it is true that for the most part, the main characters don't and really, can't drive the story forward. This part of Naruto ends with both characters being just one step closer towards their goal, but still pretty far from it since its merely their first. That's very slow for 135 episodes of mostly non-filler. Naruto suffers from the fact that it has no idea where to go and what to do after this series. It presents interesting powers, it creates interesting fights the more limitations it has, but the more tools it creates for itself, the less unique it becomes. Naruto wants to present interesting character stories, but it really starts forgetting on the way which characters caught the interest of the fans, and fails to deliver on them and thus manages to drag on, and just present a lot of new characters who don't really drag the story forward since their motivations are now singular or shallow. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't present this at all, but I want you to be aware of this, if you are a completitionist watcher, that Naruto's sequel will downgrade and why it downgrades. So I won't drag on just like the Naruto franchise, the story of Naruto tries to present a lot of characters and their motivations and does a fairly good job at it, but in this process the main characters don't get a lot of progression towards the goal they've set up to be. The characters have interesting motivations, backstories and abilities, but their personality outside of all these things is often jarring. The main character is a rambunxious cunt who screams and rants about how much he wants to make his village great again every chance he gets and the other protagonist is an emo kid with a hate filled boner. The action in the series is mostly comprised of presenting a variety of powers and before there aren't a multitude of abilities presenting, also using them in an effective way in order to make up for your gap in your knowledge gap. The comedy in the series is pretty much ranch, with the main character transforming into a naked girl for people to laugh, I guess, or characters acting in really over the top manners such as crying or being overly violent because they were slightly critical of them. In terms of production values, Naruto has a good soundtrack but some occasionally poor animation. The soundtrack is memorable because the composer used traditional japanese instruments while combining those with the sounds of more modern instruments, like guitars and drums. This made Naruto sound unique and innovative. And while Naruto's animation can be decent, it occasionally has some random dips in quality, where characters aren't drawn with a consistent level of detail to other points in the series or just because the series doesn't know how to color balance, partly because the series is also old. To conclude, Naruto did plenty of things poorly and plenty of things that are worthy of praise. But ultimately would I recommend it? Yes and no. I think it is a good watch if you're intrigued to analyze the series and see what drew interest to it, and why it even started being successful. It has some interesting story arcs and characters because of their motivations and goals. If you're looking for something you want to watch past that, avoid Naruto because it just doesn't know where to go and it is pretty much the definition of a series dragging on. Naruto didn't know where to go and just aimed to present as much content as possible. Naruto was made to sell, not made to please. Which isn't something anybody can deny, with its high amount of fillers or its just general lack of progression for its main characters. But while Naruto was made to sell, it also sold because of some qualities that it indeed did have. It built interesting characters, it created some interesting powers. And it kept doing that, without ever realizing, that series sometimes, also need an overarching plot. Which Naruto while it may not lack, it does not focus on. And while I don't think that I will ever forget Naruto, because you never forget your first time, I don't see how a longwinded story which doesn't have a point and drags on, will keep dragging in new people.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 29, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_221eff8afd,11,7679
"Note: Please excuse the length; but to do 220 episode anime justice, I think a long review is necessary. Naruto is a bit of a paradox in anime. It's pretty rare for a series to be as consistently bashed by experienced anime viewers. However, I doubt that there is another series that has been more commercially successful internationally and has helped grow anime viewership in the west than Naruto. Despite the hatred it receives from the astute critics and connoisseurs of anime, even the majority of today's anime elitists in the west are probably anime fans as a direct or indirect result of this show's influence whether they admit it or not. Further, it still has among the largest and most dedicated fanbases out there. In that sense, it's like the Metallica of anime; hated by the die-hard fans, but extremely commercially popular and the reason most metal fans are metal fans in the first place. Naruto is set in a universe in which Ninja possess mystical and spiritual powers. It is set primarily in Konoha, or the Hidden Leaf Village, and follows the life of Naruto, a young Leaf Shinobi who is hated by the entire village as he is the vessel for a spiritual monster who once attacked the village, as he seeks to overcome his low social position in the village and turn into an elite ninja, in fact the leader of his village. The plot also focuses on Sasuke, Naruto's best friend and rival, who comes from a prominent family in the village that was killed off by his brother, is widely perceived as the best and most popular student, who seeks revenge on his brother for murdering his clan and (minor spoiler) turns towards the dark side as he seeks his revenge. Right off the bat, you see the potential for an extremely good plot. We have a bildungsroman in Naruto about overcoming one's social position and starting point in life through free will and hard work, essentially avoiding Sartrean bad faith if you will. Sasuke is used as a foil to Naruto, starting from the opposite position yet is eaten up by hatred and need for revenge. All this set in a compelling universe drawing richly off of Japanese history and mythology with a very large cast of likeable characters. At least, that's what Naruto could have been. Unfortunately, the great potential for this show's concept is absolutely wasted with poor execution and we are beaten over the head that accomplishes almost nothing thematically or narratively in 220 episodes. Instead of the plot I laid out above, Naruto's main conflict is resolved, or perhaps more accurately dissolved, in the first couple dozen episodes as he's pretty quickly accepted by those around him. Naruto's motivation then becomes becoming stronger because...well, no reason. Instead, all we get is continuous cliche shounen dialogue from Naruto (and almost every other character, for that matter) about how he must ""work hard and become stronger"" at almost every moment where the show tries (and ultimately fails) to conjure up some meaning and emotion. Naruto’s motivations become almost exactly what was being satarized in the film Rubber: “no reason.” Rather than relating Sasuke's plot to Naruto's main struggle, Sasuke's plight (which, in many ways, is extremely superior to Naruto's) becomes a sort of side plot to Naruto's training. That said, there are certainly some moments where Naruto lives up to its potential. For example, the climax of the Konoha Crush, particularly the development of Gaara's character, was fairly well done, if dragged out far too long. And the Sasuke Chase arc, particularly the climax battle just before the filler arc, was riveting and developed each of the major characters fairly well. However, just after Sasuke's plot climaxes--the show just completely drops any semblance of plot. For almost 100 episodes, there is absolutely no development (with the possible exception of Gaara in the last serial ""Village of Artisans"") on any of the threads developed in the first half of the show, it is literally all filler. Normally, I'm quite a fan of shows with a ton of ""filler"" as it provides room for deeper character development, the introduction of minor characters who may play a role later, an opportunity to develop an aesthetic atmosphere, and a better emotional connection between viewers and characters. Examples of this done very well is the early bits of Fullmetal Alchemist, most of Samuari Champloo, and some of the middle parts of Monster. However, Naruto accomplishes almost none of this in the infamous ""filler arc."" With few exceptions, almost none of the already lackluster characters are developed further. Far too much time is spent on developing the backstories of side characters who have absolutely no connection to the main plot or, worse yet, on childish comic relief episodes that contribute absolutely nothing at all to the show, and in fact detract from it because they're not only a waste of time but mostly horribly unfunny. Speaking of lackluster characters, Naruto falls apart in this department. For a plot that tries to be a bildungsroman, Naruto himself is absolutely static, flat, one-dimensional, and is perhaps the worst character in the entire series. Almost every character is identical thematically; they have experienced some major loss of a loved one in the past that is explained far too slowly in a series of long-wound out flashbacks or far too quickly through contrived dialogue in the middle of battle (because when one is fighting, it's obvious that everyone tells their entire life story), and all their motivations and behaviors are completely traced back to this one incident. Almost every major character is a clone of Naruto in terms of motivation, just wanting to be the ""strongest"" for no apparent reason. Additionally, almost every major character is just a cliche copy of your typical Shounen stock characters. Finally, the antagonists--especially the main antagonist, Orochimaru--are simply awful; their motivations are either explained by a backstory that is identical to every other, or not explained at all. There are three main exceptions, Gaara, Sasuke, and Neji. Let me explain why, though I might have some minor, vague spoilers in my justification. Those characters are all fairly dynamic, thematically engaging, and have motivations that actually have something to do with their backstories beyond ""I just lost someone I love."" In Gaara's case, we find someone who learns human empathy and acts (or at least would act if they did a better job with Naruto) as a foil to Naruto's demon within in connection to a back story in which his concept of human empathy is destroyed by the blind hatred and loss of the person he loves the most. In Neji's case, we see someone who learns the value of free will in connection to his backstory revolving around his place in a rigid social hierarchy, with also somewhat of a foil to Naruto. And in Sasuke's case, a character who slowly turns darker and darker in his quest for revenge (although, as I mentioned, his characterization is ultimately dropped and left incomplete), though despite his prominence in the main plot is far too thematically disconnected from Naruto. Those three characters have really good depth and showcase the best of what Naruto has to offer. There’s also one minor exception: Menma, who is arguably the best character in the entire series, a character who has an entirely different type of backstory and who appears only in three episodes at the very end of the series, but I will not explain more in the interest of avoiding spoilers. Despite how poorly the characters are written, for some reason almost all of the major cast is very likable and addicting to watch. Even though the characters are poor in a literary sense, there is some reason I just can't quite explain why I can't completely dismiss Naruto's characters. There's a sense in which one has a sense of nostalgia for characters like Shikamaru, Hinata, Shino, and Rock Lee when they aren't on screen, even if they aren't the best-written characters. Maybe it's in the way their movements are animated, or the fact that they are just similar enough that they remind you of better-written characters in other animes in subtle ways without being too cliche, or maybe because they do have fairly entertaining personalities and various idiosyncrasies. However, even the poorly written characters add to the enjoyability of the series. Arguably other than the poorly executed and clunkily prolongated plot, the art is the worst feature of this anime. I do not mean necessarily the animation, though I will have more to say about this below, I am talking about the cinematography: directing style, dialogue, camera angles, and other artistic decisions that can often make or break a series. Even though the plot is so poorly executed and I've given it a lower score than the art (I consider cinematography a part of the art score even though most people think art refers primarily to animation, I think MAL should have a directing score), I would venture to say that the cinematography is the thing that primarily destroys Naruto's quality. It features all the standard tropes of mediocre Shounen anime that makes mediocre Shounens, well, mediocre: long-drawn out battles that are so slowly progressed they're tedious; unrealistic dialogue in the middle of fighting; poor, childish attempts at comedy thrown in at the worst times; repetitious jokes that became unfunny about the third time they were told (we get it, Jariaya’s a pervert, Koji is fat, and Kakashi likes romance novels); cliche camera angles like zooming in on a character’s eye randomly during an emotional moment, zooming in on the face during a thought/aside, or doing an angled pan shot over a battle scene during an unnecessary bit of dialogue; and extremely long flashbacks either to another identical tragic backstory to a trivial character or to events that literally happened two or three episodes ago. Speaking of dialogue, Naruto is almost laughably bad in this respect. If you hate your liver, take a shot every time some character's only line is the name of another character for no good reason, or every time someone says some variation of ""I'll train harder""/""I need to become stronger;"" or anytime someone screams out the name of whatever fighting move they're using, or every time there's some variation of ""I'm going to beat you""/""I'm gonna bring you down""/""There's no way you can beat me""/another similar cliche line that a dumb jock would utter during a sporting event. But the worst aspect of dialogue, which is more generally a problem in most shounen anime, is the way every single battle tactic is spoon-fed to the viewer through unrealistic dialogue thrown in the middle of a battle, the same way that every character's motivation is completely spoon-fed to the viewer--down to the point that if there's any tension in relationship to a character, five minutes are wasted on a flashback to scenes we've already seen before. I would expect a show about ninja to convey an atmosphere of mystery; but instead, you're continually patronized by contrived, spoon-fed explanations and dialogue. Despite my problems with the cinemetography and writing, the reason why I still don't think the art deserves a lower score is because the animation is not all bad. There are a couple slipshod moments early on in the series, and it's certainly nothing to write home about, but it's far from the worst animation I've seen. I'm generally not a fan of Studio Pierrot's style (see how they ruined the second season of Legend of Korra), but something about it is fitting for Naruto's atmosphere. The sound is also adequate in Naruto. The Japanese cast is mostly fairly good, though a few of them sound somewhat cliche. I'm ashamed to admit I watched most of this show in the English dub (simply because it's so long and I wanted to multitask a little while watching); though it's far from the worst dub out there, in fact I'd say the acting is fairly decent (maybe not the translations, I’ll defer to Japanese speakers on that), it's not as good as what I've seen from the sub. The soundtrack is also fairly nice; there are a few tracks, particularly the tribal sounding one and some of the more J-pop sounding ones, that are campy and cliche, but it generally enhances OST generally enhances the anime fairly well. Like most anime of this length, it could have benefited from more tracks on the OST as it gets fairly repetitive and predictable near the end. However, there are quite a few brilliant sounding tracks in this OST; particularly some of the softer variations of the main theme. With as many deep, deep flaws that I've pointed out, one would expect me to say I did not enjoy this series at all and would not recommend it. But this is not the case. Despite it's flaws aesthetically and even though I intellectually bash it as a critic, as a simple fan there's something deeply enjoyable about Naruto. I'll admit this was my first exposure to anime as a child as I watched the dub come out as it was released in the States, but there's something more to my enjoyment of this anime than childhood nostalgia. Though there are too many battles and they are far too long-drawn out, something should be said for Naruto's battle scenes in that they are effectively used as a storytelling mechanism rather than a device to accomplish as much action as possible, as happens all to often in Shounen anime (eg., Code Geass R2). Additionally, sometimes the strategy involved in the battles is fascinating, especially if Shikamaru's involved. The plot in the first half also isn't a complete loss as it is at least entertaining, if poorly executed. Even the much-bashed filler arc is still enjoyable to watch; there are quite a few standout serials that do develop the characters well, such as Hinata in the search for the Beatle, Kurenai-sensai in Yakumo's serial, and Gaara in the Village of Painters. There are also a few serials that stand out as just being plain good stories, such as the Gosunkugi, the Star Village mission, and the search for Menma's memory (which was my favorite part of the entire series). There's also something to be said, at least in some of the serials, for the atmosphere created by the episodic nature of the filler arc. Some of my favorite anime are episodic atmospheric series such as Mushishi and there's a sense in which Naruto's filler arc is similar, if vastly inferior in quality. In fact, I'm the first to defend an anime that lets plot take the back seat and focuses on character development and atmosphere, such as Mushishi, Hotarubi no Mori E, Hotaru no Haka, or Sword of the Stranger. This style is an accurate reflection of the Noh tradition in Japanese theater and a refreshing escape from the over-domination of plot in western storytelling that we've inherited from Aristotle. If Naruto had been episodic from the beginning and had executed its atmosphere better, the filler arc would've been fine and even completely enjoyable; but it was ultimately a letdown after the first half which was extremely plot-based and was ruined by poor attempts at humor. To sum up, despite all its flaws, it is easy to see why Naruto is among the most popular anime out there, especially among younger viewers and I still thoroughly enjoy it. It's an easy watch, highly entertaining, fairly easy to pick up in the middle (which makes it perfect for Cartoon Network's clientele), and the characters are very likable if bad in a literary sense. If you have the time to dedicate to it (and at 220 episodes, it is quite an investment) I'd say it's worth watching. And everybody should watch the three-episode Menma serial if nothing else, which works great as a stand alone. But definitely, don't expect anything profound or stellar out of this anime, and be prepared to be vexed by its campy dialogue and awful cinematography.

"Text written in English The history of anime is good, the plot is very good, the situations of struggle or story are good, the 'humanity' of some of the characters will disappear and others will emerge, and the end I thought it was good that we did a kind Bridge for shippuden. But there is a lot of ridiculous thing in Naruto, which are clichés, eg women, who are men (I'm not talking about Sasuke hehe), boring fillers '-', Kakashi model (ashamed to show your face), very cool guy call gai, three team in the Naruto practically had: the most badass (Sasuke, Neji, Kakashi, Orochi), was weaker than the most badass wanted to be better (Naruto, Lee, Obito, Jiraiya) and women healed wounds (Sakura, Ino, Rin, Tsunade). The animation is sometimes very zuada more in the general context it is good, the soundtrack is mythical, plus the voice acting is pretty bad. As it has many characters, some have the same personalities, plus the very different powers and objectives only has virtually Sasuke differently, the rest either becomes stronger, and the villains are not as good. The anime is pretty cool, plus the fillers are many boring, if you do not get bored and give up anime, skip the fillers. Texto escrito em Pt-Br(Minha lingua) A história do anime é boa,o enredo é muito bom,as situações de lutas ou história são boas,a 'humanidade',de alguns dos personagens vão desaparecendo e em outros vai surgindo,e o final eu achei bom por que fez uma especie de ponte para o shippuden. Porém existe muita coisa rídicula em Naruto,que são os clichês,exemplo:mulheres,que são homens(não estou falando do sasuke hehe),fillers chatos '-',kakashi modelo(tem vergonha de mostra o rosto),muito maneiro o cara se chamar gai,nos time de três no naruto,praticamente tinha:o mais fodão(Sasuke,Neji,Kakashi,Orochi), era mais fraco que o fodão mais queria ser melhor(Naruto,Lee,Obito,Jiraya) e as mulheres que curavam ferimentos(Sakura,Ino,Rin,Tsunade). A animação algumas vezes é muito zuada,mais no contexto geral ela é boa,a trilha sonora é mítica, mais a dublagem é muito ruim. Já que tem muitos personagens,alguns tem personalidades iguais,mais os poderes bem diferentes,e os objetivos só tem praticamente o Sasuke de diferente,o resto quer se torna mais forte,e os vilões não são tão bons. O anime é bem legal,mais os fillers são muitos chatos,se não quiser ficar entediado e desistir do anime,pule os fillers.",8,Recommended,"Jun 19, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_878b26e547,11,2399
"THIS IS THE EMBODIMENT OF A SHONEN AND ANIME!!! TOP 1 of ALL-TIME. no other anime comes close to what this series represents and has to offer. My vocabulary isn't even big enough to describe what this series means to me. This franchise will never die. As a kid I absolutely loved it and I still do. Having something grow with you is an amazing feeling. I graduate from college next monday and I can't thank naruto enough for all the lessons this series has taught me. I'm also gonna include part 2 and naruto next generations in here instead of trying to review all 3. In addition, naruto has very impressionable characters and a memorable cast especially the villains. Zabuza/haku are very well written man, they literally are the reason naruto created his ninja way. Not to mention the whole shinobi aren't just tools and have emotions plot point. Freaking delicious!! Naruto, sasuke, kakashi, zabuza/haku, orochimaru, itachi, nagato (by extension Pain) , obito, and madara are the most complex and grounded anime characters in this series. Kishimoto went crazy with the pen!! Also the various dialogue put into this is just fantastic. Itachi, pain, obito, and madara have speeches that transcend a 2D plane. Furthermore, THE DUB CAAAAST!!! Everyone knew what was going on man, dub just hit so hard. Can't forget the heart-warming moments. I don't care how old I get, naruto meeting kushina will always make me cry and him saying goodbye to minato. The character arcs go stupid too. Overall, naruto just a great experience to go through. With me have watched over 500 anime series', naruto still stands above them as the best. A timeless story. Naruto next generations honestly shouldn't have happened so fast. Rushing it out to make money lead to a lot of negative consequences like quality and pacing. I have to skip through it to stay interested and the only interesting parts are with naruto and sasuke. Waiting on time travel arc to drop, but in the meantime I got other anime that will get me through it. Naruto still has a place in my heart and I will ride it out til the end, forever.",10,Recommended,"May 1, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_86b97dc09a,11,2094
"Before I watched Naruto, I thought it looked pretty lame. I now realize I was speaking out of ignorance more than anything. I was basing my inferences on the crappy commercials from cartoon network. MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE SUBBED VERSION. Story - Naruto possess an amazing story. I found myself getting all teary eyed a bunch of times as I watched it. Quite embarrassing. The one flaw is that they over use the flashback technique. They show memories that make you feel all sad. The first time you watch Naruto this won't bother you, but if you intend to re-watch it, it becomes extremely annoying and tiresome. I found myself skipping huge chunks of the anime the second time around. Art - One word explanation. Great. Sound - Almost all of the music is great. Some of the intro songs are bad though. Like the first OP song. &quot;I wanna rocks, rocks to the chest.&quot; What the hell does this mean? I don't know. Overall Naruto is a great show. The biggest flaw is the enormous amount of fillers. Stop watching after about episode 135 because there is no more plot development, just a whole load of crap.",9,Recommended,"Jan 16, 2009",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_da8d9a09d9,11,1107
"Naruto, Naruto, Naruto. This show gets a lot of hate and a lot of praise; rarely anything in between. I can understand both sides, if we're being honest here. This show is WAY overhyped, I will admit. Do I hate it? No. Do I love it? Almost ashamed to admit it. I think this show was the first show I actually watched the American premier and stuck with it after all these years. At first, I preferred the American version to the Japanese because I hated reading subtitles, but now I prefer the Japanese, only because some characters' voices are ""slightly"" less irritating. But both are fine. Character-wise: Wow, where to begin? The characters in this show are ridiculously dramatic: tragic pasts, bad choices because of them, familial issues, blah blah blah. But despite their bitter attitudes, the main character, Uzumaki Naruto, somehow manages to change people's points of view almost every time without fail with his famous ""speeches"". Now I, personally, have never been in a fight, but I'm not sure any super villains will just stand around and watch you make a speech while wallowing in your own self-pity. Everyone eventually becomes obsessed with Naruto and after all those years of Naruto wishing everyone would like him, he ends up not giving a flying *$&^! Wanna know why? Uchiha Sasuke. Plot-wise: Yikes, Masashi Kishimoto, what have you done to Naruto? To your fans? To yourself? I think Kishimoto has enough plot holes to use as graves for every single Naruto character ever. But do fans turn the other cheek? Always. Why? Because we're so deep into this thing, why question anything now? Just shrug it off and wait for the next eye-roller he dishes out. The worst thing about this show? You guessed it! FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON FILLERS ON... Well, you get it. Need I say more? Yes, I'm bashing the ever-living daylight out of this show, but as I said before, I don't hate it. To be honest, I'll always hold a special place in my heart for Naruto. Yeah, yeah, corny, I know. Would I recommend it? I'd be too ashamed to. I'd tell you to run the other way immediately before you get sucked it. And still, I rate it a 7.

"It has an interesting story and a good plot line. The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps), the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed. But then again, there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers. ✳️Is Naruto good for beginners?

"Note: This review was written on my Review Book on Wattpad. If you are interested, don't be shy to check it out! (Link's in my bio) Ok, so if you guys don't know, Naruto is an action/martial arts/shounen anime, with a second season called Naruto Shippuden. Even though the manga was completed, the author, Masashi Kishimoto, has created a second series, or rather, a next generation, called Boruto. Though I haven't read any of that series what-so-ever, this review will be only on tt revolves around the series that revolves around Naruto. I was first introduced into anime becuase of Naruto, and I started picking up the manga at my library. I finished the manga in about a year, with every-other week trips to the library, and I pretty much enjoyed it. Later on, I started watching the anime, and the rest is history. Sometimes I'll look at some things fan-made for the series, but I dont look into it that much anymore. WARNING! THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS! Story: 8/10 Naruto's story is pretty straight-forward: a child with spiky blond hair was hated and disliked because he had a demon stuck inside him. But as he developed to be a better ninja, he learned more about his lost parents, the demon deep inside him, and how to control the power that he was given. And even though everyone hated him (except for his stalker- I mean fellow ninja who crushed on him, Hinata, his rival, Rock Lee, and every last one of his senseis), Naruto had faith in everyone, and loved them all like family. Even when Sasuke had changed sides, and joined the Akatsuki, Nauto still believed in him, and cared about him unlike everyone (Maybe not like Sakura but...) . I decided to give the story in this anime an 8, because this anime does have potential, it really does, it's just the series is pretty much over-hyped. When I got into the series, I had high hopes that it was good as the fans of the series had said. Sure, I tolerated through the whole thing, and I'm not saying it's a bad series, just over-hyped. There's also a lot of dragged out parts that shouldn't have, especially the fighting scenes. Fights took several episodes, even though they could've been covered in one or two. Generally, I feel as if the story is pretty good over-all, but it's not a masterpiece like most people say it is. Art: 7/10 Ok, so yes, I like some of the outfit designs given to certain characters (Ex: Kiba, Deidara, Hinata, etc.,), but others were, no offense, but really werent smart (*cough cough* Choji *chough cough*). I mean, when you give a character a bage to wear on their head like a pair of fricken panties, and you thought that was a good idea? I'm sorry but you have problems. Also, there were many flaws and errors in the graphic designs that are unforgettable, like some of the graphics with Pain. Yes, some of the results can be funny, like pausing Lost Pause or something, but I mean sometimes you'd see flaws in the animation without pausing. I feel as if I've seen better art and animation styles in later animes that I've seen. Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack to this series is probably one of the most memorable parts to the series, especially some of the more sadder things, like Gaara's backstory. Though some of the fight themes could've deserved better themes, and the tribal-voice song thing wasn't as good either, but I'm deciding to give the soundtrack an 8, because most of it I enjoyed, and openings werent that bad either. Characters: 7/10 The characters in Naruto have good and bad to them. I love how each character has a dream that is related to their backstory, and how some characters can relate to another in some way (Ex: Gaara and Naruto have been hated for the demons they posses inside them). But what I really don't like is Naruto's stupidity. And the fact that they stereotype women as if they can't do anything. Like seriously, first off, Naruto's stupidity isn't that silly, goofy-cute stupidity, like Nichijou is, it's just really annoying and immature stupidity, like after a while i was just like ""Okay Naruto, thats enough. Just fucking stop."" Another thing: Girls are stereotyped as useless in this anime. Sure, I really dislike Sakura, but every time she or any other female character tries to make a difference in the show, the spotlight and glory is shined on Naruto and his male buddies. I mean, come on! If you don't want the women to do anything in the show then don't put them there! For example, there was like one guy in Magica Madoka, and he didn't really make a difference in the show, so the creators didn't use him that much. And that makes sense. But please, if you're going to create a bunch of ""Main Characters"" that arent going to do anything at all besides waste space, then dont add them at all. So, in conclusion, because even though we have some problems that include stereotyping and personality traits in some protaginists, I decided to give this section of my review an 7/10. Enjoyment/General: 6/10 Seeing this was the very first anime I had ever watched, I thought that it was pretty good. But, for some reason, when I go back to it, I feel as if the series was a bit overhyped, and after I finished Naruto, there were other animes that I just enjoyed a lot more than Naruto. Yes, it was a good anime to start out with three years ago for me, but as I had more internet advantages, I had the chance to branch out my variety in anime and manga, and I found a ton of better animes. And for some reason I seem to enjoy the less likely animes rather than the ones that everyone talks about. So in general, I'd give Naruto a 6, a 5 at the least. It wasn't one of my personal favorites, but I'm pretty sure there are plenty of crappy animes to move it up the list.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 20, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_42ff1ef000,11,5714
"The synopsis describes the show well. My take: Naruto is a very good anime to watch with one condition. Find a list of filler episodes and consequently skip them when watching the series. Thank me later. Otherwise, prepare to explore a ninja world far-removed from the typical black-clad ninja the west has come to know. This story follows the exploits of the show's namesake, Naruto, and his simple but atypical approach to life as a ninja. Along the way you will be introduced to a memorable and quirky cast of characters, such as fellow ninja student and Naruto's love interest, Sakura, his cold-blooded rival Sasuke, and their enigmatically awesome teacher Kakeshi. The animation for the show is decent, the story is intriguing, and the music is very memorable. 8/10.",8,Recommended,"Aug 12, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_9326ea7d2c,12,771
"Minor Spoilers here read at own risk Just a heads up I skipped all but one episode of filler for Naruto. So my opinions are just of the canon. The story of Naruto is actually quite hard to explain. It follows 5 canon story arcs. The Prologue arc, The Chunin Exam Arc, The Konoha Crush Arc, The Tsunade Arc and the Sasuke Retrieval arc. Each arc has its own complex story that tends to build off of the previous arc. It's done very well actually, to the point where I didn't realize that the Konoha Crush arc happened. I had thought for the longest time that it the Konoha Crush arc was a part of the Chunin Exam arc. Some could see this as a problem, the show failing to show the start of a new arc. I think I was just being stupid lol. Each story arc has its own ups and down. I could be here all day talking about them. In my opinion the Chunin Exam arc and the Sasuke Retrieval Arc are definitely the best. One thing I wanna highlight is Naruto's great character development and how the anime shows you his character development. All of the main arc antagonist act as foils to Naruto. In the beginning of the anime, Naruto is selfish. One of the two main arc ""villains"" is the exact opposite of Naruto at this point. Haku's dream to help Zabuza achieve his dream. Every single action Haku does, he does for his friend. In the Chunin Exam arc, Naruto believes that anyone can become strong if they try hard enough. He believes in his strength and the strength of his friends. Two characters that Naruto believes in are Hinata and Rock Lee. The main arc antagonist, Neji, believes that people, like Naruto and his friends are born failures and will always be failures. The Knoha Crush arc, Gaara fights for only himself, Naruto fights to protect his friends. You get the idea. Each arc villain is used to show how much Naruto has grown as a ninja and as a person. He learns to care about his friends over anything else, which is a huge difference from when he started. I will be the first to admit, Naruot's main three characters are very annoying at times. You have the bratty Naruto, the edgey Sasuke and the useless Sakura. To make up for having three somewhat unlikable main characters, you have a butt load of side characters. Kiba, Shino, Hinata, Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Neji, Rock Lee, TenTen, and much much more. So there is bound to be one character you will end up liking. For me it was Shikamaru, Gaara, and my favorite Naruto character, Rock Lee. But despite having a large cast of side characters, the female characters almost as a whole are boring and useless. Its really sad, Sakura and Ino are just carbon copies of each other, except Ino is a little more mean. TenTen does nothing at all in the canon episodes. I think she has one fight and then is only seen again to explain minor things to the audience. Hinata is a really interesting character, but is under used. Temari is a really fun character that gets some cool fights, but is also under used. The coolest female character doesn't appear till the fourth main story arc. It's saddening to see no real effort put into the female side characters. The Op's For Naruto are pretty good for the most part. They are really fun at times and help to show the theme of some of the story arcs. Though Op 6, 7, 8, 9 are during filler so they don't have that much to work with sadly. That leads to op 7 and 8 being pretty disappointing for the most part. Despite taking place during filler, Op 9 has become a fan favorite. Due to it's impressive use of silhouette fight scenes in the op. Personal favorites of mine are Op 3 and 5. Op 3 because it shows a clear theme of moving on with your past and getting trough loneliness. And Op 5 because it is just a really fun op that does foreshadow a few important events that take place in the story. The art for Naruto is average and inconstant at times. The art style will just randomly change between some important episodes. It tends to change right before an important fight. It's annoying to have it suddenly change for a few episodes, then goes right back to the normal art style. The biggest problem for this show comes is the Mary Sue elements they throw in there. Mary Sue is a term for a character that is perfect in every way and solves everything problem with some stupid new ability that he//she just suddenly obtains. The best example of this is Neo from the Matrix. None of Naruto's characters are perfect, they all have clear flaws that are easily noticeable. But it's that second part of a Mary Sue that Naruto falls victim to. Sasuke Uchiha is almost a complete Mary Sue. If it wasn't for him being a complete jerk to everyone, he would be 100% Mary Sue. Everyone loves Sasuke. They all think he is awesome and show loves to remind you that fact over and over again. Despite his awful attitude and the fact that he literally cares about no one, he is loved and cherished by all. Almost all the girls at one point think about how cute Sasuke is. He is the equivalent of Kirito from SAO. Except you are forced to deal with Sasuke for over 100 episodes. The biggest problem with Sasuke is his special ability, Sharingan. The Sharingan allows Sasuke to predict his opponents moves and copy them. It's really cool at first, till you realize how stupid it is. The Sharingan also has a hypnotic ability that is stupid powerful. At this point Sasuke's Sharingan is in the weaker stages, but it still lets him when many fights he should easily lose. At one point they make you think Sasuke won't win every single fight with Sharingan, and while he does lose a few fights, the Sharangin allows him to win many fights he should lose. The Sharingan also randomly powers up when it needs to. When Sasuke can't see his opponents movements, boom, Sharingan upgrades. If it wasn't for Sharingan, Sasuke would be easier to deal with. Naruto himself also falls victim to the random bursts of power that Mary Sues have. But with Naruto it is much easier to deal with because his power up, being the Chakra of the nine-tailed beast, only powers him up when needed. He isn't constantly using the nine-tailed beast chakra, he only uses a little bit of it in his fights. Some fights he doesn't use it at all. And unlike Sasuke who is just naturally good with Sharingan, it takes Naruot a lot of time to learn the basics of controlling the beasts chakra. And even with this massive power boast he still loses some fights with it. It doesn't feel overpowered because Naruto isn't using it constantly, he only uses its full power against incredibly powerful opponents. Now to talk about my favorite thing in Naruto, the fights. Naruto's fights feel so impressive because of justu. Justu is basically the equivalent to ki attacks in DBZ. There is limitless possibilities with justu. Each character has a special move or move type. Naruto has shadow clone justu, Sasuke has Chodori, Shikamaru has shadow possession justu, etc. Their move pool is limited to only 1 or 2 justus (unless you are Sasuke, he has 4 justu) so seeing them have to think of special strategy to win their fights. Shikamaru's fights, in particular, are very impressive. The show establishes the fact that he is a genies and use it fully. He comes up with incredible strategies to win his fights, yet he always stays true to his lazy nature. It's actually funny, cause Naruto's fights are actually pretty boring. Until the fourth story arc, the only real combat move he knows is shadow clone justu. So most of his fights just become a punching match. And as much as I hate Sasuke, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy his fights a lot. But, the most impressive fighter has to be Rock Lee. He can't use justu of any kind. So instead he uses taijustu, which is hand to hand combat. He is at a massive disadvantage in every single fight, yet he still does an amazing job. Even if he doesn't win every fight, he always wears his opponent down. There are so many good things about Naruto, the fights, the decent plot, Naruto's character development, the side characters. But the flaws in the show are big, a lack of strong female characters and Sasuke's whole entire character. Just Sasuke's presence ruins multiple scenes. Characters like Sasuke are bland characters with so much wasted potential. When the show tries to get you to care and feel bad about Sasuke it fails. Because we know who Sasuke is, it doesn't matter how sad his past is when we can't relate to him in the present. We can't like him in the present because he isn't a good person at all. He was only a good person as a child, if the show started with that and then we saw the transformation of him becoming a jerk in the beginning of the series, then maybe we could care about him. But, he starts the show off as a jerk and ends the show off as an even bigger jerk than he was before. Despite my problems with Sasuke and the female characters, I would sill recommend Naruto to anyone. It is a good show, with many great qualities. The show struggles in regard to girls and Sasuke, but besides that, I found myself enjoying almost every single moment of Naruto.

"Naruto is easily in first place in my top 10 worst/i hate animes of all times, i have never seen a anime this overrated before, the only other being gurren lagann, this series started more than an decade and there are still those fools who think it's an epic story, and unfortunately raised what is now one of the worst fanbases of all animes alongside one piece and dragon ball, it didn't make part of my childhood lucky for me because for a lot of people it did, and unfortunately i don't even like talking about anime with those it did because i can see they don't much about anime to begin with There are many reasons why this is the anime series i hate the most, this is an list of someone who tried more than once to like this godforsaken story, but unfortunately in the end it served of nothing, the only redeemable valor is the soundtrack and a few fights, and that's it, and that cannot hold an series. That aside let's start this rather long list 1.Main characters, the characters in naruto are the very definition of cliche, especially Sasuke, the guy is screams cliche every time a word come out of his mouth, characters in naruto are really badly developed, aside naruto and and maybe shikamaru, gaara, hinata and itachi, all others are mostly throw in the thrash can without a decent development or even a decent fight, also, my god sakura and ino motivation, is that what they want? date an prick who treats everyone like shit and think is dark and badass?'''oh i want to kill my brother'' that's arguably one of the worst motivations in an anime, and people say Sakura and Ino are good characters, not even in hell they are, they were always terrible, no wonder as the series went on hinata started to become more and more popular, because the girl always had an objective despite liking naruto, these two became so notorious even the most die hard fans of naruto often hate especially sakura who is useless, people are tired of this princess stereotype of female characters that can't do jack shit and that's why often you see people who prefer the villains over the main characters(this includes myself). 2.Villains, the villains on the counterpart, are actually more interesting than the main characters, especially Zabuza, Haku, Orochimaru, Kimimaro, Itachi, Kisame, Kakuzu and hidan(the best duo)etc however they are just like a lot of the main characters thrown in the thrash, they have great potential but are poorly used and are defeated by some of the most outrageous plot armor in an anime ever, especially Kimimaro, which had big potential, this same feat will repeat in shippuden with characters like, sasori, deidara, kakuzu and hidan(my two favorites), the entire akatsuki, they could have been the main characters not the villains easily since they are leagues more interesting than the main characters, hell imagine how cool would it be if konan was the main ''heroine'' instead of generic and boring character that sakura is? 3. World/Lore, the world in naruto was never well explored or well used, there are other villages but in the end is all about konoha, clichemoto tries to make the series have an deeper world and lore and etc, but he fails every time because he doesn't know what to do with it, the characters only mention other places and villages, but its never shown, and to tell the truth the other villages from what is commented are a lot more interesting, but mostly pointless, the only interesting thing on its lore is the bijuu like kurama/kyuubi and shukaku and a few others that appear on shippuden, and that's it, it doesn't explore beyond that, and even that he finds and way to screw it up by making bijuus except kyuubi useless for the most part except awaking the 10 tails. 4.Bad logics and plot armor, ever since naruto started, it was clear clichemoto doesn't know how to make character power levels, because it makes no fucking sense, and kid who trained idk for like only months be able to beat and war veteran and born to battle enemies who knows a lot more about fighting and still loses, this is ridiculous, this is an example of bad logic and use of plot armor, and this happens from starts to finish and it manages to become worse in naruto shippuden where the restrictions are thrown in the garbage and everyone starts to become chakra gods. 5.The animation, well the naruto animation always had an bad legacy, it has a lot of flaws and just plain errors that can be noticed if you pause while watching, some even say not to pause naruto while watching if you want to avoid it, the worst part, is because there are other animes from pierrot like bleach, and bleach has nowhere near the same problem naruto had, which makes you question why the fuck it's animations are bad for the most part and feel cheap, there are other animes from that same decade that don't look as cheap as naruto, and don't think the manga is way better because clichemoto is not that good in drawing, occasionally rising above average but not that much 6.Soundtrack, the soundtrack in the series is perhaps one of the few solid points of it, it has soundtracks that unfortunately marked an generation, but aren't necessarily good nor bad, it only served more to please the naruto fanboys so they can keep living in their forever nostalgia, sure there good soundtracks, but i would say there are better ones out there, hell bleach has an even better soundtrack, shiro sagisou did an better job in bleach compared to naruto soundtrack, also the openings, well the only one i consider good is the last opening, which is not an j-rock opening we have seen a million times, it also demonstrates martial arts better than the anime, and unfortunately almost all of the other openings are j-rocks that are nostalgia driven, and aren't really that good, also fuck you asian kung fu generation for making one of the most overrated openings in the planet that relies on nostalgia, also known as haruka kanata 7. Fillers, naruto is already notorious along with bleach and even one piece for it's fillers, it's one of the reasons a lot of people(like me) hate the series, the fillers really made the quantity of episodes bigger than it should, naruto shippuden ended with 500 episodes thanks to it's god forsaken fillers, and classic naruto is no different, the series were stretched out thanks to them, and that's not a good thing, plainly made for greedy reasons to keep the money flowing and also give time for clichemoto to create more cliche chapters. 8. Story, the story in naruto can be noticed to be very scripted and filled with some of the most boring cliches ever, this is why when the fourth ninja war happened and it went downhill and consequently screwed naruto reputation(for me a good thing, finally people woke the fuck up that it has never been this amazing story to begin with), because the story revolves on the same classic idea of good x evil, sometimes trying to blur the lines of good and evil along with a bit of philosophy, but it doesn't hold up it's cliches nor it saves, it just makes you crave when something new happens, only to be filled with cliches again and again as if they were new and ''good'', and people use naruto story as an compare meter to other animes, which is pathetic, this story has never been that good to begin with, starts slow and weak, gains a bit of strength, goes downhill, it's not like bleach and one piece, were bleach starts really strong, one of the best shounens starts ever and then loses a bit of steam but manages to get back, or one piece where it starts really weak but then BOOM especially in the alabasta and marine ford arc, also this is another problem, there is no marine ford arc level on naruto, which just shows how clichemoto doesn't know what to do sometimes This is perhaps naruto biggest flaw, some of you will agree others might just some insane logic to try justify it, but it's still an flaw, and it never got better in the series, especially in the fillers, and it's one of the reasons i hate naruto because it shits on this pre-idealized idea for some generic designs and the final and biggest flaw is.. 9.The characters don't fucking LOOK LIKE NINJAS TO BEGIN WITH, This is pretty much an flaw of naruto that breaks immersion and makes you see the characters as anything else like monks, mages etc anything but ninjas, clichemoto character designs for the most part sucks, and it shits on the idea of ninjas, you know stealth oriented warriors that are completely in black, and are deadly and kill without hesitation, which is something 90% of the characters lack, the only two characters in this entire fucking series that look like an ninja and act like an ninja or close to it, is Kakuzu and Haku, BOTH WERE SO BADLY USED AND DEFEATED BY PLOT ARMOR THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS, WHY THE ONLY FUCKING 2 CHARACTERS THAT LOOK LIKE NINJA IN THE SERIES, WERE THROWN IN THE GARBAGE, WHILE CHARACTERS LIKE NARUTO HIMSELF,KIBA, INO, SAKURA, SASUKE, CHOUJI, TENTEN, ROCK LEE, KANKURU, TEMARI,KONOHAMARU AND HIS FRIENDS, SHIKAMARU, GAARA ETC DON'T LOOK LIKE NINJAS ARE STILL IN THE SERIES, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO STUPID THEORY OR JACK SHIT WILL JUSTIFY THIS, NARUTO IS THE WORST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPEN TO CONCEPT OF NINJAS AND IT ALSO MANAGED TO DETURPATE IT, WHY THE FUCK PEOPLE TURN AN BLIND EYE TO IT? ''oh but is clichemoto interpretation of ninjas'' NO ONE ASKED FOR HIS INTERPRETATION OF NINJAS, THE GUY NEVER HAD AN CLUE OF WHAT AN NINJA LOOKS LIKE FROM IT'S HINTED ON HIS CHARACTERS DESIGNS AND HE SUCKS, IF YOU COMPARE TO D-GRAY MAN CHARACTER DESIGNS, NARUTO IS ANEMIC ON THAT ASPECT. And perhaps this is it, all the reasons why this series sucks and is overrated, it's an series that has finally fucking finished,(at least until boruto shows up ZzZzZz) being stretched up to 500 episodes thanks to its fillers, and perhaps something better will come to take it's place, from which i deeply hope, this series is an testament of how people let their nostalgia a lot of time speak bigger and ignore flaws, flaws from which made naruto lose a lot of popularity especially in the future fourth ninja war, like i said i tried more than once to like it, but i's like banging my head against the wall for something not worthwhile, i hope clichemoto(yes i call him this way after my friend called him that) at least learn something from all of his mistakes, and please god stay away from any other ethnic group and don't try to deturpate it, this review is huge but i wanted to stay clear all the reasons, not just some empty hater who just hates it because it's popular, no i hate it because it was never that great to begin with, only have popularity, thank you and have a nice day watching better animes.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 3, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e45a18edf8,12,10709
"This is my first review, so please forgive me if I make grammar mistakes as English isn't my first language Naruto is a show that many have grew up with, many people love this anime and I have lots of friends who told me Naruto was the first anime they've watched, even Naruto was the first anime I've watched. But enough of bias opinions, I'm here to tell you whether or not you should watch this show. Story: The story is simple to follow and isn't difficult to understand, although some points in the story it's starts to downgrade and begins to become a bit sloppy, the show is 220 episodes long and does it ever feel to slow down? Yes it does sometimes, I wasn't completely upset by this as I still enjoyed the story till it's finish line. Overall: 7 Art: The animation unfortunately isn't very consistent, it sometimes dips in quality and can look really bad sometimes, other times it can look great where it's concentrated at best, some of the fight scenes in this show can be done good or bad. thankfully the majority of them are good(in my opinion at least) Overall: 6 Sound: The music in this show really is one of the best aspects about this show, the most notable one is probably the sad tones which stand out the most, especially in emotional scenes. Even when the battles start the music gets you pumped up and excited. Overall: 8 Character: There is a large cast of characters in this show, there are some good and some bad characters, Naruto can be found annoying sometimes and it's easy to see why, the character designs are unique and it's an underrated aspect of the show, each character looks and sounds different, with different morals and goals which makes the characters so beloved in the Naruto series. Overall: 7 Enjoyment: You can enjoy the series a lot, watching Naruto getting better and learning from his mistakes gives you a feeling of happiness, unfortunately the show has a lot of fillers which are one of the biggest drawbacks of this show, fortunately you can easily skip these episodes by searching online filler and non-filler episodes of Naruto and you can end up enjoying the series a lot. Overall: 8 So should you watch this show? Yes, It's a show with many flaws but can still enjoy it on certain level, just don't have high expectations or you will be severely disappointed.",7,Recommended,"Jul 1, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1075c86724,12,2315
"Introduction *Skip this paragraph if you don't want to read me blabbering on and on and want to go to the story review part.* Naruto is a great anime that I have watched so far, I started off with Naruto Shippuden at first because I didn't know about the original Naruto. I then, held on to Naruto Shippuden at about episode 200 when I found out about Naruto. After I started the first few episodes, I was very hooked and it seemed really cool seeing Naruto when he was young and knowing the back stories of Naruto. I finished watching all the episodes in about 1-2 weeks, due to the fact that I was on Summer Break and had the whole day free to do as I please. Story 9/10 In the beginning of the anime, the first few episodes was great. They gave me tears when I was watching them because it was both joyful and sad. Later on, the story began to get me very hooked due to all the action, friendship, and training in it. It taught me many lessons and got me thinking. The fighting and action in it was enjoyable and didn't last too long or too short like many other action anime. What made me give a 9/10 instead of a 10 full was because: First, I didn't like the too many fillers that didn't relate to the story and was very boring. Second, the fighting was repetitive, Lastly, I didn't like the flash backs that Naruto had *SPOILER* about Sakura, Sasuke, and him. *END OF SPOILER* (Or if you want to avoid the boring parts, skip to the Overall Review) Art and Sound 10/10 First of all, the art was great considering when the anime was made. The art included lots of detail and the colouring was great. Next, the sound for the dub that I was watching was very good. I didn't notice any mistakes in it at all. I might have lots of Spoilers here during the Character Review so if you don't want any spoilers, skip to Enjoyment Review Character 7/10 The characters were okay but *SPOILER* I didn't really like how Naruto's personality was being all goofy and weak. I personally didn't like how Sakura treated Naruto very poorly, and Sasuke like he was the hero of everything. I also didn't like how all Naruto's classmates including his friends, Sakura and Sasuke treated Naruto and bullied him. But I guess the bullying made Naruto stronger and not weak anymore. The last thing I didn't like was how Sasuke showed off all the time and called Naruto a loser. *END OF SPOILER* Now, moving on to what I did like. *SPOILER* I liked how Naruto's character developed from a weak crying boy, into a strong, never giving up kid. I also really liked the scene when Naruto fought Kabuto to save Tsunade and him not giving up even though he had little chance of beating Kabuto. *END OF SPOILER* Enjoyment 10/10 Even though there were some minor things that I didn't like, I really did enjoy this anime. It is one of the few best anime I've watched. This anime is really enjoyable and if you haven't watched it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW! Overall 9/10 This anime is just great with some minor mistakes/annoyance in it. As I said in the Enjoyment Review, if you haven't watched this anime, GO WATCH IT NOW!!",9,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b168af7ef5,12,3087
"Naruto is a mediocre anime but the main reason why everyone remembers it better than it actually was is because nostalgia. I'm sure plenty of old Naruto watchers used to do that stupid run and stuff like that makes people remember it more. The story is aight and same goes for the art. The soundtrack is alright as some of the sound effects are memorable,I can't say the same about it's OP and ending besides Fighting Dreamers. The characters are the usual shonen protagonist. Bullied kid,Cocky Bastard,Useless girl,A sensei to teach him shit. Naruto is the embodiment of the classic Anime protagonist. Even though it's a mediocre show,I enjoy it purely based on nostalgia. If you're in your early teens,you'll probably like this but if you're in your latter teens/adults,you're gonna cringe a ton. You probably shouldn't watch this.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 28, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_52f2781bd9,12,833
"To be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!

"i was a big fan of this manga & show when i was in elementary school but as the time i grow up i kinda find the story too monotonous but it doesn't mean it's boring. Story [9/10] acually the plot and the universe is masterpiece, pretty interesting and well made, but as i grow up reading this manga, it's kinda like lacking something... i wonder what it is.. Art [10/10] but i have no objection with the art & animation is superb, the action and all is the best! if i would compare to any other anime that have combat action scene i think naruto is one of the top list! Sound [9/10] the thing that make the anime feels badass is the soundtrack of course! the authentic japanese style ost definitely left a great impression to the audience, especially who watch it as a kid will feels this nostalgic feeling when re-hearing the bgm of this anime >.< Overall[8/10] well it's a masterpiece anyway and everybody knows about this anime existence HOWEVER!! my intention to write this review is there's one thing that i really want to praise of this series! especially only for this series not the shippuden! for any other long running shounen manga that adapted to anime.. SOMEHOW.. i found naruto filler episode is the best! even i kinda skipped one piece filler episode, but there are interesting filler episode of naruto that become my fav! because it has a lot of character, the filler makes it great how its create more story about the side character and how the relationship between each other!

"Alright, let's get into this. I have watched Naruto as a comfort anime since I began it when I was 7. This review is coming from someone who really likes Naruto to this day, 9 years later. But I will be as honest as possible. If you are just now watching Naruto I'm sure there aren't as many good reviews, for it's time Naruto was definitely cool and interesting in concept and execution. Also you're pretty late to the party but that's alright :). The concept is very cool, a story about ninjas, fights, bad guys, and the characters finding themselves? Heck yeah, sign me up. The story is done well, one of the big complaints I saw was the amount of fight scenes. This wasn't really an issue for me as I like action packed anime. Another complaint I saw was fillers. And since I started this anime so young, I didn't know what fillers were so they never bothered me. But I re-watch Naruto almost every summer, and honestly they still don't bother me. I always treat filler episodes as a kind of break, for me and the characters. Plus most of the filler episodes were pretty fun, aside from some of the less interesting ones. But if you can't stand fillers I really can't recommend with full confidence no matter how much I love Naruto. That isn't to say that fillers are the whole anime or that they ruin it, but there are a lot and some people would rather not and that's understandable. CHARACTERS!! This is where my personal favorite part comes in, but it also comes with some of my biggest complaints. The overall character development is very cool, especially if you continue to Shippuden. The main character, Naruto grows into a very likable person right in front of you. Sakura is one of the most complained about, as she is seen as useless and annoying girl who just needs help constantly. But personally she was one of my favorites, because her constantly feeling useless and even being called it by the other characters made her want to be better. And lead to great character development over time. Sasuke is the edgy mf that younger fans of the anime always end up fangirling over. Not that it's a problem just kind of silly :). He is the mysterious guy, has his own selfish goals and cares not for the rest of the main characters. (seen above). He's also strong from a pretty young age, and smart too with gifts of his own. But he still needed a lot of work to get better and that makes him not so unpleasantly overpowered. He shows a lot of changing of which I can't mention because of spoiler reasons. But he still has a growth throughout the anime, even if it is in a strange kind of way. Now my biggest complaints about characters, is that some of them are very interesting and cool in their own ways that are nothing like the main characters. A lot of my favorite characters didn't get a whole lot of screen time and felt VERY slightly neglected. I say slightly because eventually, if I'm not mixing in Shippuden here, most every character gets some kind of screen time with their squad. Which made me very happy to see them have their own little arc. But they do tend to do typical side character things, but they are still pretty well rounded overall. Fight scenes are an interesting thing to review on Naruto. While being a lover of fight scenes and not really caring how long they go on for, I would get very invested and the time just passed. Some would last several episodes and could have been done in fewer, but it just added a little something I can't explain. But yes there are long fights. The fighting animations are really fairly done. I'm not an animator so I feel uncomfortable dissecting it harshly. I felt that it was overall smooth and eye catching. Very proud of the studio. Overall 8/10 :)",8,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_14683ff89e,12,3727
"Okay Okay Okay. Naruto is a great series to watch... If you have no job and have a few spare hours to fill. It has enough to be mildly entertaining. I have a few annoyances with this series though. Characters: Usually naruto and sakura; They both tend to do things in the middle of a fight that make you want to cringe at. Sakura just sits in fear, hardly has a decent fight scene. Is really boring to watch. HELL!! It annoys me when she constantly bags Naruto for being useless and you feel like screaming ""WELL WHY DONT YOU GET OFF YOUR ASS THEN SAKURA!!"" Naruto: I enjoy humour, but this kids a little brat. He just complains and gets in the way all the time. Its like that annoying smelly 5yro cousin the constantly gets his face in the way when you are ready a book. Or who sits and asks a million questions when you are playing video games... annoying is an understatement. Also, when it comes to the fight scenes. I get extremely annoyed at sequences where the main hero powers up to his highest levels AND STILL GETS THE SHIT KICKED OUT OF THEM! You get all excited, only to be very disappointed. I might add Dragonball Z has this problem time and time again. Plus the fight plots arent very creative. it starts off easy, then the enemy has hidden potential. someone comes in and saves the day.... BEARLY!! There arent any moments when you are proud of the characters triumphs. By the time it ends you are left thinking ""well its about time!"" Also, I dislike the lack of variety in the fighting. They seem to forever repeat the same attack again and again. No new moves. No combos. Nothing that makes the next boss fight amazing! Coming back to things characters do that are just flatout stupid. You think ""that was obvious!! how did you not notice! you are a freaking ninja!!!"" Im not saying they need to be godly powerful, but its not clever stuff that gets them. ALSO IM SICK OF THE REPLACEMENT JUTSU! the one where they trap the guy and they turn out to be a log or something. WAY WAY OVER USED!!! I might just add, that Gurren Lagaan has none of this and is still amazing. The fighting is impressive and gets.to.the.point. when they power up, you know its gunna get brutal! and it does! Even when Rock Lee uses his 'Forbidden' jutsu, its amazing!!! But it doesnt even amount to the finishing move. He still loses and it kinda feels like it was pointless to even try. I like my Movies, anime etc to get to the point and stay on track. Like Dragon Ball; naruto is fine to watch with a spare moment. But its so repetative in ideas, it feels like ""same shit different story"" THE END",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 5, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_29ade9dd3e,12,2591
"Review 6: Naruto (Favourite hero of all time)??? now if you haven't ever seen or watched naruto, then ur crazy..... and if you haven't even heard of Naruto....then where the hell have you been all of your life!!!! Nearly every anime fan as watched or has been reading naruto and if you haven't and you love manga or anime then you truely do not deserve the title Super Fans or Fanettes!!!!!!! if you haven't heard of Naruto then i do sort of feel sorry for you in a way, since nearly everyone has at least been reading or has read the naruto series. i don't want to ruin it for nearly everyone who actually reads this review but it is an amazing series that everyone should check out, it doesn't matter if you read the series or watch the series it really is worth your time and will stay with you for the rest of your life. obviously naruto is the main character through out the series, he lives in a small village with plenty of other ninjas that are his age and there are plenty more kids you'll meet on the way to discovering who naruto actually is and what can make him so powerfull yet so stupid at times. Naruto: obviously the main character in the series. he's a young, active and slightly weird boy who loves being a ninja even though he isn't very good at it..... He's crazy even from the beginning of the book when as soon as you go onto the first page he's dangling from a rope painting on the hokage (s) stautes faces, he does get caught and then you can see how weird he actually is. Most of the teachers get extremely annoyed with him no matter what he does, he annoys a lot of people in his classes and is jealous of the strongest and most good looking boy there is named Susuke. He hates him and never gets a long with him, apart from that Naruto can be an annoying boy in the series but as time passes you grow to love him even more! he can be really strong and quick witted at times, like when ever he's in a fight. you'll grow to love him as time passes on. Sasuke: A mysterious young boy who's about the same age as Naruto, every girl in the school loves him and has an extreme crush on him, he isn't really bothered about all of the girls though he and he doesn't seem to act really cool he just is cool.....naturally!!!!! every time he walks in to the class room all of the girls stare and it falls quiet. Naruto hates his guts because he gets all of the attention off of the girls, Sasuke hates him aswell which must be natural aswell. At the start you'll love him but as the series progresses then your opinions on him may change slightly. Sakura: Sakura is a young girl about the same age as Sasuke and Naruto, the only difference inbetween Sakura and the other two is the fact that she is mature enough to understand that not everyone has to be rivals in life, she loves almost everything and has the biggest crush on Sasuke ever, but Sasuke captures all of the girls hearts so he doesn't really notice if there is one person stands out more than the others. She has a rivalry with an old freind that you'll meet later on in the series. She doesn't have a mysterious past at all, but when she was younger she did get bullied a lot for having a high forehead which made her stand out a little bit more then everyone else. she's an average character who i think everyone will love from the start. if you live in england then you might know that there is a magazine called NEO which comes out every month and if you read that then you should now how many films there are on the naruto series, how popular it is, the fact that there are loads of videogames on the series and that naruto has to be in the magazine every month to new releases and new books coming out. the series is on going and amazing even though it is long. if i was one of you guys and i was reading this i would check it out straight away it really is worth the time and you will enjoy it. i would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!!!!!! of all ages!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4th Of July 1:15 pm ~Amy Xxxx",10,Recommended,"Jun 8, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_5a7d43c2b5,12,3983
"Naruto is exactly the epitome of what's wrong with shounen anime/manga the same way Bleach and Dragon Ball were flawed. YES I realize these three anime, however flaws they may have, are iconic and staple mainstream anime... but if you stopped to think about the story REALLY, they're not very good. Naruto starts off strong and likable as a series altogether. The show however uses a bad trope that ruins most shounen stories; escalation and one upping the previous arc with a stronger enemy. And the protagonist becoming stronger by rinse/repeating what they did previous arcs is how they show character growth? So dumb. I know most people complain about fillers but I don't even need to. Even without the fillers, this anime gets it so horribly wrong. By the end, they lost sight of what this anime was even about in the beginning. Sure he wants to be Hokage but honestly that's so vague and general in the grand scheme of things going around our character. Also how this anime holds your hands like a baby? Do we really need a flashback to the last episode 3 times in one episode? Naruto is trash; there's a lot to like about Naruto but ultimately it isn't very good. If you MUST know what happens in Naruto, just read the manga so you won't at least waste your time. This show is so cringe worthy too; like if a giant monster is attacking you and you just took a fatal blow to save someone, you're going to die or the monster will go after you. It's not going to let you sit there and allow for a crying sappy 10 minute scene. Stay far away from Naruto. Go watch Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. It's actually a good shounen and holds up well. Also, shows like FMA does NOT use the terrible ""escalation"" trope where the character's growth and journey is parallel to their growth of strength/power like some bad Dragon Ball fanfic.",4,Not Recommended,"Jul 28, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb5692bd4a,12,1835
"Great. Although this is for kids actually, teens can totally relate to it. But I was a bit disappointed with the character output. The personality of the characters were a bit edgy, especially Haruno Sakura. I don't think her personality suits her. She's too brutal on Naruto, and a bit fake on others, especially Sasuke. But despite this flaw, Naruto is one of the must-see anime titles for everyone.

"I just got into Anime a couple years ago. My most favorite will always be Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden. It's the only anime so far that has gotten me to cry a lot. I feel all the things that the characters are going through. It's about friendship,family,pride of where you come from. This show makes me laugh,makes me cry, I've even yelled at my computer screen when things happen I don't like. lol. I never came across any show like Naruto that had me fall completely in love with it. I do admit when I heard of this show I thought it was just for kids. That it was going to be this lame kid show. Boy was I wrong! My sister actually got me into anime and introduced me to Naruto. I'm so glad she did! I thank her like everyday. I love everything about Naruto. The storyline,the characters,music,animation. EVERYTHING!!. Naruto is always in my heart. Hands down the best anime! This is my opinion though. People have others that they love more or what they think is the best ever. I've told some other anime fans that Naruto was my most fav and they would laugh.

Interesting story to back it up. A few cliches, but not to many. The only parts that I can really complain about are the dub and filler. A few of the voices(paticularly Naruto's) just make me clench my teeth. And the filler, THE F*%$ING FILLER! An episode or two in between arcs? Not bad, somtimes enjoyable. BUT 90+ EPISODES OF FILLER?! My advice? Watch it.

"Naruto is one of those animes that is really well known has a huge following. I've attempted to watch it for years but failed in a couple attempts. But thanks to netflix i have finally been able to watch the entire series. Well minus the filler i skipped those episodes. The show starts out and i hated the lead character he was loud and annoying and seemed to repeat the same lines a ridiculous amount. As the show went i would say i had passing interest until around the episode 50 mark in the series. The characters seemed to really start to develop around this point. In the chuein exam arc in particular. Naruto himself gradually became less annoying. Sakura slowly faded to the background before disapearing almost completly. I found that supporting cast was actually moe likeable then the main cast. Kikashi was two scoops of awesome but their would be long spans of time he would completly disappear from the show. this would happen with pretty much everyone except Naruto. One problem was that some fights would drag on way too long. One in particular that featured a character death took so long that the impact of this characters death was completly lost. This was something id call dbz syndrome where a character over explains their moves. Another thing that came up alot is that it seemed during every battle a character would say ""i have used up all of my chakra"" or something around those lines it got to a ridiculous point that i joked about it with a friend. I think what holds this series back is the fact that it drags things out too much. In the same way dragonball z did. The fights that are the most enjoyable are the more all out action fights. There were fights that did last multiple episodes that were fantastic like the last ""main"" fight of the series that the animators seemed to bring beyond their a game and during that series of episodes itself i would give a ten for the arc as things just looked beautiful. The story had some great moments and if some things werent dragged out like i think that if the show were cut it half we probably wouldnt lose alot. All in all i would recommend this show it may not live up to the hype some people give it but it does have its moments it is worth a viewing if you have the time i would suggest finding a filler list to skip filler episodes though.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 11, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f10db1fa70,12,2320

Watching episodes......painfully getting through the god damn story arcs that were only occupying show length I realized something.......IT WAS WASTING MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't get me wrong it was enjoyable........it just wouldn't stop with the fucking story arcs!!!!!

"Naruto has changed my life for the better, growing up with it in my childhood it really helped me through some tough times. I absolutely adore this anime even with its glaring flaws, like, for example, the story sometimes gets mixed up and doesn't make sense a bit of the time. Even with those, it's an outstanding anime that I would rewatch thousand times over. But again, there are major flaws. They tend to make some characters bland or not even give them enough screen-time to flesh them out, characters like TenTen are really good examples of a good idea but not enough screen-time. Not to mention, Sakura, a main character, had hardly any screen-time and was the bland female companion to slow down everybody. Bringing it back up, the story sometimes gets a bit mixed up in itself which can lead to confusion or completely backing up on something to make it work. I get it, the whole series was 720 episodes you can't really predict what'll happen in the next 700 episodes, but storyboarding exists for a reason. People wonder why I like Naruto as much as I do, but I gotta say it's mainly because of just the overall appeal of it. Who doesn't like a story about ninjas who can do cool techniques featuring elemental styles? Not to mention there are some techniques that are a mixture of elements for specific people or clans, it's really just an overall great concept. Not to mention I really enjoy some of the characters, one of my personal favorites is Neji because he was a really fleshed-out character with motives that seemed reasonable. All in all if you wanted to, I'd advise recommending this to your friends or even watch it yourself. It's a good watch and it'll definitely fill up a lot of time and boredom.",10,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_798b46880a,12,1724
"I haven't read the manga. Yes, I watched the dub. This review is episode 1 to episode 135. SPOILERS! Naruto really isn't that amazing. It's story is overall decent with some great moments with decent characters but it doesn't matter because it's fun. The characters are fun even if they aren't that deep and their designs are great. Kakashi, Shikamaru, Guy, Lee, Temari, Jiraiya, Hiruzen, Tsunade, Neji, Hinata, Kiba, Shino are all good even if some of them don't get a lot of screen time. Standout is Shikamaru my favorite, he's a genius with a unique way a fighting, he's lazy, he has great moments, his sexism is a fun character quirk when all his fights are against girls and he just a cool guy who's actually one of the nicest. Tsunade is the perfect foul to Naruto, Naruto is an optimistic kid with a big dream while Tsunade is a bitter old lady who drinks and gambles who's lost the people important in her life. Sakura and Ino are the weak links but Sakura does improve. The main villains are great. Orochimaru, Zabuza, Haku, Gaara, Kabuto, Itachi, Kisame,The Sound Ninja 4, Kimimaro, and eventually Sasuke are all great. There are some weaker minor villains but they serve their purpose. The music is amazing and they sound effects are nice. Openings 1-5 are all great. They're not Full Metal Alchemist level but they come close. The fights are great. Their long length will turn a lot of people off but they feel like real struggles with the two fighters in combat for hours and the show really sells the illusion of multiple fights occuring simultaneously. One major problem, the show really overuses flashbacks. Most of the time they're new information and they're interesting. They have good visuals and music but there are many that look visually boring or are information we've already scene and only pad out the run time. Top 7 Fights 7. Shikamaru vs Temari 6.

Naruto is one of the best story lines no one will tell you otherwise. However i feel like if someone knew nothing about Naruto and just watched the first few episodes they may find it a bit too childish but i ashore you if you can battle threw the first few episodes you will find out why people of all ages love this story so much and hopefully they make it to shippuden for a even more enjoyable experience. there are some darker moments to the show that give many a new perspective on life its almost like watching a motivational video as well as a very well done story its a long story but definitely worth the watch. 8/10,8,Recommended,"Feb 24, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_520f96e5cf,13,626
"I love this shit, ever since 8th grade when I started this show its made me feel nostalgia no other show has ever made me feel. God damn, shippuden kinda dissapointed me but this, this shit rocks. This show deeper than anime, the life lessons actually meant something and kinda shaped my life into me wanting to be a hardworking person. The nostalgia when I think about being a kid watching this show is overwhelming. Never in my life have I cried over a show, unless i tried to i dont think I would be able to cry. But Naruto, the nostalgia, it made me so happy yet sad as I reminised over my childhood and the sheer happiness I had when I saw this show. I can understand why people think its overhyped, you need the right conditions to experience this fucking masterpiece.

"So, Naruto. The first anime I watched, back when I was 8. I rewatched it recently and deciced review it. Naruto is a Masterpiece. Don't get me wrong, I know it has a lot of flaws, but the positives aspects outway massively the negatives ones. So, let's get started: The story: amazing and unique. It talks about an alternative world where most of the population are ninjas, that do missions to help their villages and can do special techniques/ attacks with hand signals and 'chakra'. The commedy was , for the most part, funny ; the mistery was enthralling. The pacing was decent, not being great because of some filler episodes. The art: honestly, is the weakest part of this anime (as well as the animation). The beginning especially, although we can forgive it because it is from 2002. It gets progressively better and better as the episodes go on. The animation is fine too. The sound: awesome! I can't say if the japanese voice actors fit the characters or if they were good (beacuse I watched in my native language, not japanese - in my language they did fit the characters and were good). The music and sound effects were amazing. Sad songs to make you feel, inspiring / 'fighting' songs to get you hyped and excited. The characters: very good too. Of course there are some steriotyped characters, but overall they were interesting, and they did a good job developing secundary characters' personalities and backstories. I thing I found fascinating while watching Naruto was that you see the evolution of the characters. They grow, deteriorate and learn with their experiences, throughout the series. Maybe part of why I love Naruto so much is beacuse it feels very nostalgic to me, but I am sure you can enjoy it even if that doesn't apply to you. I really enjoyed this anime, and it will be forever in my heart. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Feb 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_7cfd726b00,13,1827
"I'm a short and sweet kind of reviewer Overall I do believe that is so is very, very over hyped, at the same time it doesn't live up to it. what I mean is the majority of fans will like it be able to follow the story and have little to no complaints, but people who may have higher standards for animes. For me this is the first anime I ve watched all of the way through every episode. some of things I liked was the character development, the characters don't have a random spike in power, or just some bullcrap a randomly happen. its a slow steady climb and when the he there peak power is feels natural. another thing I liked was how they pulled your emotions through the story. it was kind of like real life in away. every time a character grew and though they were at the max somebody was better than them and challenged them to grow even more.. some things I hated was the overlapping of episodes. most of them were the filler episodes but there were some cannon episodes did kind of retell what happen the last one and it was the whole episode, or even the origin stories were at least 2-3 episodes long which was annoying to me. Overall this does hold a special place in my heart as the first anime I watched all the way through, and has I said at the start this is a great anime for people wanting to get into it so I suggest you what it but don't get your hopes to high P.S IM WAITIG ON A DUBBED VERSION OF 336 OF SHIPPUDEN TO COME OUT PLS I CANT DO SUB",9,Recommended,"Apr 24, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_6c6d57b1c7,13,1463

"Naruto.. I wasn't sure how to go about writing this since it's such a long series, so I figured the best way would to be write a little bit as I go and piece them together. You immediately start off with Naruto Uzumaki, he's a cheeky kid, always causing trouble and when he's not, he's eating. Though you find out pretty quickly that there's a reason for it; he just wants to be cared for. Everybody has always looked down on him and judged him for reasons he didn't know. He always just figured it was because he was different, not because of something inside of him. Finding out he has the love he's wanted from Iruka sensei, his point of view starts to change but so does everything else. From there he's placed in Team 7 with Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto has a massive crush on Sakura, Sakura loves Sasuke, and he doesn't really want anything to do with either of them. Naruto comes to have a lot of respect for Kakashi sensei, like he does with Iruka and then Jiraiya. All 3 of them play a big part in his personal development. They all show him he's loved, which is something important to him. From the beginning it's a little slow, but it gets better. New characters start coming in, whether they're here with their own stories or to embellish on unfolding the plot, it depends on the person. Some stay and become prominent, others are just in and out very quickly. In all honesty, for a lot of it it wasn't really keeping my attention well, there'd be a couple of laughs or plot points that would catch my attention, but it would drop off quickly; Until Jiraiya. He's what saved the series for me, his character type and personality, but with him came the story getting deeper and lots of questions about how multiple different things will turn out. As with really long series, it takes a pretty long time for the story to get deep, this is no different. But once it does, it's decent. A lot of it is kids growing up, that might be why I wasn't enjoying it a whole lot until more adult humour came into it. But if kiddy characters and voices annoy you, this probably will too. They're kids, they're learning, so things that are obvious to the viewers aren't quickly discovered by them, there's childish arguments and irresponsibility. But they're kids. That's the point. This is showing them growing up, becoming better and learning about themselves and others. That's one thing about the fillers, I always watch them, but people who skipped them for this missed all the growth these kids go through. Becoming stronger mentally and physically, seeing it happen is one of the best parts, and makes the fillers worth it. There are some definite feels parts, I got a little teary a couple of times. The Menma Memory Search mission arc was a big one. So be prepared for hidden emotional parts, because they pop up out of nowhere. By the end I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, no it's not something I'm extremely impressed with but I'm happy I finished it. I enjoyed it, I'm glad I gave it a chance to prove that it's better than I assumed it would be, and I can see why so many people enjoy it.",7,Recommended,"Dec 3, 2016",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_2db0b136b8,13,3116

Allow me to list: Sasuke, Kakashi, Neji, Shikamaru, Haku, Itachi, Kimimaro, Jiarya, Orochimaru, Tsunade, Gaara, All the Aukatski, Any kage, basically anyone with kekkei ginkai.

To enjoy this great anime I recommend to skip these episodes, there are many sites that have a list of these episodes so it's easy to skip the fillers and to start enjoyimng the actual show. The story of Naruto is great, I love everything about the world the anime takes you in. The way they make you love the village and the ninjas in it, it's just amazing. The storyline has so many exciting things and unexpected twists. It didn't take me long to adjust to this show and love it. The art is good, but I've seen better. The characters look very unique but when it comes to quality it isn't outstanding. But I have to say that I have no problems with this. The fight scenes look good and almost each fight is memorable. The music in Naruto fits in every aspect. This is such an important feature in Naruto. It completes every scene in it. Almost every opening is an opening that you won't skip. The music is just great. The character diversity is another great thing about Naruto. You'll love so much characters as much as you love Naruto himself. Each and everyone has something unique and that's why you'll love them. A lot of character developement, very divers abilities, diffrent disigns. Konoha isn't the same if one of its ninjas wasn't there.

"Well, my first review on this website - lets see how this goes! So, I like to think of myself as a definite otaku (...sad to admit, I know). However if being obsessed over anime is what 'otaku' means then I most definitely fit the description. Naruto was the second anime I watched when I was beginning my 'japanese cartoon' journey and I'll tell you all now - if you want to get yourself dedicated to a shounen/ninja/hero/action anime with a little emotional rollarcoaster thrown in with a bucket of laughs to top it off then Naruto is definitely one to get yourself attached to. True, you might think I'm going into this with a bias opinion and I probably am however I'm going to write a review anyway. Story:- I gave the story a 9 because despite my never ending love for the anime it does contain a few plot holes which (depending on how hard you look) are noticable when you look back. For example; parents! We don't see enough of the parents buuuut nagging parents aren't something you want in an action packed anime. It might just be the hardcore fans that need the little details (I know I certainly do). And when I say little details, that's all they really are. The story arcs all eventually link together towards the end of Shippuden (which is the sequal season to Naruto) but you can tell that at the beginning of Naruto they didn't know they were going to have a second season. Art:- I gave the art an 8. Now I was a bit skeptical of my choice because the only reason I'm not marking it a nine is because of it's age. It was first released in 2002 so you can only imagine the old animating style they used to have then. You can clearly see the progression of the style as time goes on. In the main areas of animation; speaking, running, fighting etc I'd say they're top notch for the resources they had 'back in the day'. Sound:- I gave this a 10 because of the soundtrack. Naruto (and Shippuden) has some of the most beautiful and emotional music in the anime community. When I'm looking at Youtube comments I can see that people who don't want the anime are listening to this music. It's amazing. Simply put. And when put to the animation it's even more incredible. Such an experience! Real edge of your seat stuff! (I don't mean to sound cheesy). Character:- This is where Naruto gets a liiiittle flawed. I'm giving it an 8 because of the way they sometimes portray little girls. And I don't mean anything to do with hentai, Christ no, I just mean sometimes they forget how young girls are. You know it; crying. And this is where I'll leave it for 'character' because I don't want you to go into this anime clouded by the fact they portray some girls a little annoying. Enjoyment:- Well, obviously a 10! I, to this day, enjoy Naruto as much as I did when I first started it. Thoroughly enjoy every episode, including the fillers. Overall:- I gave it a 9 all together because of the two 8s and two 10s. Overall a fantastic anime which came to it's end at 220 episodes. When you get to the end, God, you don't know how to feel. You don't know if you can ever feel again. But it's worth, afterwards you get a whole season more! WhooO! I think I lost steam towards the end but I hope you find the time in your schedule to add this in. It's a great anime!",9,Recommended,"Apr 3, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e26e2f7ef2,13,3266

"There are so many reasons to love the classic Naruto. The very first reason is the character Naruto himself. He is a young boy who is very immature. As the show progresses he begins to grow up. It is so fun to see him develop into a true shinobi. While the show focuses on Naruto he is not the only character who develops. There are many characters who you will fall in love with along the way. As far as the story goes it is quite compelling to a certain extent. What I mean by that is it tends to drag on a little bit. While on this note one downside to this anime is the number of filler episodes. It seems like once most of the show is done (around 3/4) the filler episodes go full force. The only problem with this is it has nothing to do with the main plot. So for that reason, I have lowered the overall score.",8,Recommended,"May 30, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_942a8b1f81,13,817

The story is one of the best i've seen, and after watching it again last year I can confirm it even more. The art may not look the best but the fight scenes are portrayed very well with the angles and sound and portray emotion very well. The sound is very good and their are many unique effects famous from this anime. OBVIOUSLY the characters are exceptional. You can really see their development and they get you to feel emotion for lost characters. Even the fillers in Naruto are very good and do a exceptional job at keeping you entertained.

"The series started out well, but as it progressed the characters began to become boring, and the fights seemed too prolonged. The story wasn&#039;t anything special, in fact I&#039;d say it was below average. It all just seemed way too stretched out. The art was okay. I&#039;ve always liked the art in the manga. (Although I can&#039;t say that the animation was high quality.) The sound was okay too. Not bad, but nothing special. The characters... I just felt that he could have done a lot more with them. Overall, the series was enjoyable. (or part of it at least.)",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 17, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_733f2e02ad,13,569
"Ah Naruto the classic anime underrated by these dbz loving so-called ""experts"" with a very original but simple concept if you think about it i mean sure some parts can be callled cliche for example the hidden power thing but be that cast aside its a epic storyline about his journey to bring back his best friend Story: It starts with him beeing an outcast in his own village, joining a group of genin shinobi with the two genins Sakura and Sasuke he begins practically hating Sasuke but they begin earning each others mutual respect and befriending each other as rivals when the antagonist starts appealing to Sasukes dark past and his thirst for revenge it ends up in him leaving the village having Naruto and Sakura desperatly searching for clues on his whereabouts. i give the story10/10 Art and Animation: well its a well drawn anime and compared to the shitty dragonball art it can be counted as epic but ive seen better and animation was pretty good or at least in the fights and as for the the characters well they were great sure some cliches like iill die protecting my friends and that but that still matches well with the story and though Naruto's character shaping would probably be pretty stereotype in the anime world and sure sakura is the typical schoolgirl personality all of that matches in with the story, and not to mention the awesome support charcters But the main thing about Naruto is that youll enjoy it very much and if you watch naruto youll never ever consider watching such shitty art as dragonball",10,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2010",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_31c2ae6467,13,1528
"Naruto 1% action, 99% flashbacks I love this anime and yet I hate the anime. It’s all about ninjas. The ideas are great but the story isn’t told well. So Naruto has a demon sealed inside him. A demon with nine tails, it’s one of nine tailed demons from the One Tail to the Nine Tails. Because of this Naruto is hated by the villagers because this demon attacked their village a few years back. Naruto’s dream is to become leader of the village, the Hokage. This is the basic plot so far. Now my main problem with this anime is that it’s suppose to be an action anime but there isn’t that much action, just a bunch of talking, Naruto constantly makes a speech about how he wants to be Hokaga, Hokage, Hokage. When you think you’re gonna get a cool action sequence they interrupt it with a flashback. And they reuse the same flashbacks over and over and over… It’s like Dragonball Z, now this is an anime that I love and hate. DBZ’s problem is that they’re always standing around staring at each other, charging their power, etc. But DBZ is better, better action, more interesting villains, etc. You might enjoy this anime if you watch it online, but back then I didn’t have internet and was forced to watch 1 episode a week, so I didn’t have time to waste with flashbacks. Not much to say about Shippudden, Naruto hasn’t changed that much, he still uses the same techniques, the show got more serious but it’s still 1%action 99%flashbacks. My favorite characters are Mito Guy and Rock Lee, these are I think the only two who actually use martial arts whereas everybody else is using ninjutsu and genjutsu (“magic” techniques)",7,Recommended,"Jun 1, 2012",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_f0fc9173be,13,1624
"Just skip the fillers and you'll most likely watch the best shonen out there. I finished the complete Naruto series within 2 months. Without the fillers you still need to watch around 400 episodes but you'll never get bored even once. It's a true masterpiece. The soundtrack alone is just perfect, it fits every scene perfectly! Furthermore you get a perfect japanese dubbing, each voice is unique and acted out superbad. The story is one of the most meaningful ever created. Overall as I stated before it really is a masterpiece. Of course it has flaws but overall you'll get to see some of the best villains ever created (all of them carry a superior motivation, noone is just plain evil), the twists are really breathtaking and you get great character development as well (even the smallest siderole gets the time it deserves to fill that person with life). You won't regret it, I promise. It's due to the fillers that a lot of people dropped it so you are lucky now being able to circumvent them and to enjoy the canon story to it's whole extent.",10,Recommended,"Apr 13, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_3bc171d0ba,14,1050
"I watched Naruto when I was a kid, because there was nothing else on TV. So I had to basically do with what I had. I didn't particulary enjoy it at the time either because there were more interesting shows on air like the hilarious dub for Duel Masters which is one of my all-time favorites. Naruto? Pfft, sure, the first, like 30 episodes are alright, up until the genin exam is over or whatever that shit was. And then Sasuke turns up the edge levels so high you could cut yourself if you touched the screen. The character development is an absolute joke and if you actually have some taste you'd know that someone who spouts nonsense about growing stronger and whatever the fuck else while managing to be so incredibly annoying and without any redeeming values whatsoever except the fact that they are vaguely fascinating to look at when genderbent, cannot be a good lead character. And you'd be right! Naruto is one of the, if not THE worst lead characters of all fucking time. A harem protagonist is more entertaining to watch than this bloke. It's obvious he's going to win every fight, it's obvious he's gonna train hard and get better every time. It's painfully obvious whenever someone smiles off-cam that something evil and spooky is gonna happen. Now I know the general consensus about this load of trash, it got most people into anime(unfortunately) and also unfortunate is the fact that they didn't stop after Naruto, they went after other edgy shows like Tokyo Ghoul and whatever other miraculous trainwreck and made the scores skyrocket. The fandom is garbage for this show but that's not related to it's show itself, just tangentially. You see, this show gathers all your pains and hardships from when you were an oppressed Eastern European infant with a fox in your guts and turns it into the most disgusting power trip you'll ever see, it's delusional, and suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Perhaps the delusional premise is what is most attractive when it comes to Naruto. Cause that shit just doesn't happen, ever, and if you're gonna be a smartass and tell me it's fiction, then tell the genius behind this series to make fiction credible within it's own described limits and not just plop a twist and jump the powerlevels by a googol every time he feels like it. It's strangely entertaining to watch things fly on the screen but at that point you're basically okay with just about anything ranging from flies circling your lightbulb or Michael Bay. Naruto is basically the B-Movie of anime. The budget for this is trash so the show looks as you might expect, the sound is, like, something to write home about in the sense that it's so boring you have to tell someone how boring it is. Terrible in fact, the music is trash too. Didn't have to be anything high-brow but damn they could've hired some better bands to perform instead of those garage party trash lid bangers that worked on this. If you want a power-level heavy show that really does take its time to tell you how people got those powers, in detail, bit by bit. Wasting a good two episodes or three to show you how people die. Then go for DBZ. If you just want a good shounen, a story about growing up and becoming stronger, with some real actual emotion. A Sasuke archetype that isn't completely shit. A god damn banging OP that will stay with you till your very last day. Then go with the king. YuYu Hakusho. That's my baby, that's my secret ingredient. If you feel the strange necessity to call this a good anime because you get nostalgic when you watch it, then do take in consideration the fact that you're basing it off the fact that you get nostalgic when you watch it, not because it's good. And it's true. Naruto is fucking garbage.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 26, 2015",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_efc42d934d,14,3732
"I originally refused to watch the Naruto series all together simply because the characters appeared annoying and childish to me. I eventually tried watching it and failed the first and second time. I eventually saw the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke on youtube and this allowed me to give the series more of a chance. I rather liked it. This is one of the harder series to write a review for due to the sheer length of it. There are too many recaps throughout episodes; these take up sometimes 10-15 minutes of a 23 minute episode which is rather annoying. Filler episodes are also littered throughout the series which can be beneficial or annoying depending on how many and how bad/good each episode is. The last 40 episodes consist of about 20 filler episodes which was horrible. The length also gives it several benefits character development is one of the most notable (Maybe not for Sakura…). Character growth and evolvement is visible in many of the main and supporting characters especially Naruto and Sasuke. The animations throughout the series are solid and there are several instance of using unique art styles to help enhance fight sense and humor. The voice acting is well done but, the dialogue can be very cheesy at time, making one possibly slam their face into a wall. Naruto is an exciting series that has a solid and creative storyline complimented with excellent character development. Regardless of any shortcomings previously mentioned Naruto is a solid series and worth watching. It also has some of the best fight scenes in anime.",8,Recommended,"Jun 11, 2011",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ebcdde18e5,14,1561
"As you can see I had to give this anime 7's all across mainly because the last 70 episodes were dreadful and drag this anime down a whole lot. With that said the first 130 episodes or so were fantastic I Must say. Naruto was one of the first animes I cracked open, and at first it appeared fresh and bold taking Anime to a new level, and it did for the most part. Although Naruto has MANY good points, it also fails miserable at many things. Story The Story has been kind of done before, a loser kid wanting to become a winner. But this loser kid has been given some kind of special power which the leader of his ninja clan implanted in him at birth known as the Nine Tail fox. Naruto now looks to become the leader of his Ninja clan, so Naruto Uzamaki with this orange jump suit and heart wrenching battle cry &quot;IM GONA BE HOKAGE&quot; sets out to become the best ninja in his clan. Characters This is where I really enjoyed the show and didn&rsquo;t enjoy the show. Of course Naruto the main protagonist is interesting for a while but the anime focuses far to much on him and puts everyone else in a very long waiting line. No other characters besides Naruto and to some extent Sauske (Narutos rival and best friend)get a fair level of development. Now the villains are certainly exciting in Naruto and for most fans like myself, the villains actually carry the show more then Naruto. Its always interesting when the villains are conspiring mysterious schemes. Overall Although Naruto is entertaining at first, it quickly begins to fade as a show that&rsquo;s lived for too long. After a while the story line becomes weak and very boring as fans ache to see more of the villain instead are fed filler episodes. The characters may get annoying but to Naruto&rsquo;s credit, the fighting style and drama is very real and new. If your looking for that anime that has a good level of action, drama, and comedy you should try Naruto.",7,Recommended,"Sep 11, 2008",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_69cfbb2661,14,1934
"be honest, Naruto is the most overhyped show in existence. Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better. The concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and they have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil. The story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). The story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing... Fillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. Also, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between. Another thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators. As a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him. The music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too. The characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya. That's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. I also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. Basically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down. I have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show. Of course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&quo;ve heard it was much better&help; I really hope so!",10,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e936a953c7,14,6060
"MINOR SPOILER!!! Naruto is one of the greatest pieces of fiction in existence not even anime and it's not a debate. While it's not The Best Piece of Fiction or anime, It is by far the most influential and iconic shonen anime after Dragon Ball. It is an anime that defined the culture of Shonen anime. Naruto is one of the most Over Hated Anime of all time due to it's immense popularity. There are alot of Haters of this show and one thing I've noticed is that most of them are One Piece fans, I love One Piece but I would never hate on this Master Piece and I prefer it Naruto over One Piece after catching up. To put it, OG Naruto was a whole vibe of a show at in my opinion it had no Bad Arc and had only one bad episode(canon episode) and that was Sakura vs Ino(LOL). Review of the canon arcs: 1. Land of Waves Arc: 9.1/10 This Arc is one of if not the best first arc in all of anime and I'm not biased at all. The Land of Wave's Arc sets up this beautiful show really well and it has some very iconic moments which I will not get into if you are one of the people who haven't watched it 2. Chunin Exams: 9.2/10 Chunin Exams was another brilliant arc, Tournament Arcs always go hard and it's not hard to screw them up. The Chunin Exams were an emotion with all the things that happened in it. I can't go into much detail because I don't want to give spoilers to new fans of anime but this arc is pretty relatable with every character struggling in the Traditional Test cuz it always felt like that 3. Konoha Crash: 9.1/10 Konoha Crash follow's after the Chunin Exam's arc cuz Orochimaru(A Gay snake man) pops up and decides to vampire bite children(pedo). It follows are main guys trynna stop this gay pedo from killing everything and it is just one hell of a ride. It has some iconic moments that are unforgettable and adds on the this beautiful piece of fiction 4. Search for Tsunade: 8.4/10 The Search for Tsunade certainly wasn't a top tier arc but it had some really hype moments during the conclusion of it. This is the arc where Naruto master's the Rasengan and show's us that Talent isn't everything and with Hard Work, even the impossible is possible 5. Sasuke Recovery Mission: 10/10 The Arc that Turned Boys into Men. This arc was one hell of an Arc. The gist is, Sasuke has gone rogue and decided to go with the snake pedo in order to achieve power to beat a certain somebody which is not Naruto that we met during the Tsunade arc. This Arc was a master piece and the Naruto and Sasuke fight at the end was just a feast for the eye's, it still remains in my top 5 favorite fights in all of Anime. This Arc is better than most New Gen Shonen Anime coming out like Demon Slayer, Jujutsu Kaisen S1 and even MHA and a million time's better than all of Boruto Negatives: I've only Boasted alot about this anime but I should talk about the few flaw's in this anime 1. Naruto is quite annoying, now I love my boy Naruto, but he can be pretty annoying 2. Sakura, that's it, the entire character of Sakura is boring and infuriating 3. It doesn't give it's side character's development, it only developed Naruto and Sasuke throughout the anime 4. Too much Filler but it can be skipped but it is kinda sad that alot of it is filler 5. The Pacing can be slow sometimes but most times, it really good and not boring Rating: 9.1+9.2+9.1+8.4+10=45.8 = 45.8/No of arcs = 45.8/5 = 9.16 Final Score: 9.16/10",9,Recommended,"Jul 20, 2023",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_59a4b9a4dc,14,3405
"The story centers on Naruto Uzumaki, a young knucklehead ninja who lives in the hidden leaf village of Konoha. He is often shunned and ignored by most people because years ago a fox demon called Nine Tails tried to destroy the village but was sealed inside Naruto as an infant. Wanting to prove himself as a force for good, Naruto makes it his goal to become Hokage, the leader of the village. Once Naruto graduates from the ninja academy, he joins Team 7 headed by elite shinobi (ninja) Kakashi Hatake. Naruto is also joined by Sasuke Uchiha, who wants to avenge his clan by killing his brother, and Sakura Haruno. Together they go on numerous missions honing their jutsu, as Naruto and Sasuke compete and fight alongside each other. The world they live in is populated with colorful characters, as well as villains who want to throw the other nations out of balance for their ends. Particularly the dangerous shinobi Orochimaru, who shows interest in Sasuke for his natural gifts. He offers Sasuke the power he needs to kill his older brother, which results in Naruto and his friends doing everything they can to stop Sasuke from going down a dark path. Whenever people think of shonen anime, this is usually the type of show that comes to mind. In that, it focuses on the hero’s journey about an underdog with latent powers he didn’t know he had, and trains to hone his abilities as he fights stronger opponents along the way. If you liked “Dragon Ball” but wished it had ninjas, then this is up your alley. It’s obvious that creator Masashi Kishimoto was heavily influenced by “Dragon Ball.” You can tell since both series share similar character archetypes, as well as humor. Some of the visual cues are obvious as well with Naruto loosely resembling Super Saiyan Goku’s appearance, and Sasuke resembling Vegeta. Both characters even share a similar frenemy rivalry that plays a major role throughout the series. Even though its inspirations are obvious, “Naruto” was more grounded in its concept because it was able to tackle meaningful morals and themes that make for deep storytelling. Naruto being an outcast is already something people can identify with. There’s also the fact that he starts out as the least talented ninja of his class. While these are tropes we’ve seen done numerous times, you still want to see what they do with this character. Not only in how he matures, but also in how he literally learns to master his inner demon. I also like how Naruto and Sasuke have similar backgrounds of having lost their families and are trying to accomplish their individual goals. With Naruto wanting to prove his worth, and Sasuke’s desire to avenge his family. Even though Sasuke is more respected by his peers because of his bloodline, he willingly distances himself from most people because of his tragic past. You see where both characters are coming from and understand why they make the choices they make. While you like seeing them interact with one another, you also want to see them go all out and see who comes out on top, which is what you would expect from a classic anime rivalry. With that said, there are a few characters I wish were given more purpose. For example, Sakura’s character was not very interesting. Most of the other characters have multiple traits and arcs surrounding them, but for some reason, she’s mainly relegated to the love interest archetype. While they do have her do some action, and even give her an arc where she proves she’s useful, I feel like a lot more could have been done with this character. Eventually, they give her a major role near the end of the series, but I feel it could have been done a lot sooner.",9,Recommended,"Feb 17, 2022",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_4d0072be7c,14,3667
"I watched Naruto fully over the course of several months, as i was very turned off by some of the filler that was painfully boring, not to say that all the filler was boring, because some of the filler is actually entertaining when done right. The Story of Naruto was very entertaining up until the Naruto/Sasuke fight, which afterwards is basically filler until the final episode. My favorite arcs from the story were the Chunins Exams, (yes, i know its a tournament arc, but still) the Zabuza arc, and any arcs with Jiraiya. The story grinds to a halt after the fight in the final valley and that is where the series turns into filler and it suffers as a result. The Art is obviously not the best, as many have probably paused the show and seen some very questionable still frames of characters. The style of the show is still very recognizable which i feel sets it apart. The Sound for the show is some of the best of heard. From the Fight music to the ""Sad Naruto Music"" the show excels in conveying the emotion of what is happening. The Characters are great with the Main cast of Kakashi Hatake, Naruto Uzamaki, Sasuke Uchiha, and Sakura Haruno (not really her though.). The side characters also are very well adapted, as shown with the Sasuke Recovery Mission arc. The only character that really gets on my nerves is obviously Sakura. I know hating on Sakura is a tired out subject, but it is very true, everything she did in the series was basically whine about Sasuke or hit Naruto, while one of her character defining moments was cutting her hair. I enjoyed Naruto a lot, despite its very apparent flaws and would recommend this to anyone wanting a long series to binge.",8,Recommended,"Jun 17, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_289ccc3303,14,1679

"— Canon arcs were solid, except for the unnecessary recycled flashback spams at times which really annoyed me, if I'm being honest. Sasuke Retrieval Arc could easily have been a solid 10 had it not been for the Naruto vs. Sasuke on rooftop flashbacks for like a million times. However, the progression was great & it always leaves you at a state where you'd be asking for more & more. Enjoyably intriguing, to say the least! — Filler arcs, on the contrary, were inconsistent throughout with no evident tonal difference, which was a great aspect. Some were great, some were good, some were mediocre & some were flat-out boring. However, the filler arcs explored the characters, provided them some sort of growth & surfed the world pretty well! But whether the events & developments remain intact remains to be seen. I'd be happily surprised if some of the filler arcs are addressed in the future! That said, the one-shot fillers were mostly hilariously great! Wish if they did those much more than what they did otherwise. — All the characters were great. However, the vast developments were mostly dedicated towards Sasuke & Naruto. Sakura, for example, barely had any major significance or impact. Hinata too barely appeared in the canon arcs, with all the ""crush"" & stuffs there was to show. On the other hand, many characters particularly required no such development & were really likeable! Naruto's charm made him the best character of the show pretty easily. Although, Kakashi, Jiraiya, Tsunade, Lee, Guy, Gaara & Shikamaru were few of the others I liked too! Character designs were also as lovely — Naruto, Iino, Sakura, Sasuke, Itachi, Kakashi, Tsunade, Jiraiya, Kiba, Neji, Shikamaru, Choji, Shino & Anko's designs specifically were my favourites! — Comedy was spot-on. Even though some of them were repetitive at times (Jiraiya sneaking in on women, Lee drunk, etc), they always felt hilarious! My favourite gag was Kakashi's excuses for getting late though! — World-building felt solid & really interesting at times, but nothing was particularly explored to the extent where it could be judged thoroughly. The fillers could've done a better job, under the supervision of the Mangaka, at this one instead of just throwing off random locations. — Action was brilliant for most of the part, from choreography, to shot composition & animation! Especially in the canon arcs. The power system however wasn't mind-blowing or something but was simplistic & that's where its strength was! Although what held back the action's full potential was the storytelling structuring, in my opinion. For example, One Piece usually sorts out a huge chunk of flashbacks before the real fight begins. But for Naruto, it's the opposite. The start-stop-start-stop action is something I didn't exactly like, as it all comes down to preference after all. — Off-the-fights animation, on the contrary, was inconsistent throughout just as the art. Sometimes, the characters looked too round or sharp, with the backgrounds being good or mediocre. Animation too felt stiff where the characters looked so unlike. But whenever Studio Pierrot animated an episode themselves, it was always fabulous! — Background music was great throughout. Nothing extraordinary, nowhere near bad. The perfect balance you can ask for. Although, a bit old school understandably. But honestly speaking, it gets kind of repetitive & boring at times as the series progresses. — Opening & ending themes mostly were boring to me. Fighting Dreamers, however, was an iconic banger undoubtedly! Three or four OP & ED were also good enough. — I watched the full series in English dub & I must say, it was fantastic! From cast to the voice acting, everything was top-notch. The only English voice I wasn't fond of was of Orochimaru. Overall, 9.5/10 for the dub! — Movies were so very unlike the series. All of them were bad or just ""barely watchable."" However, most of the OVA's were great! Especially the Sports Day one! — But despite having not read the manga, I can confidently say the direction was mostly spot-on for the canon arcs but the fillers spread basically ruined its potential of greatness. 89 episodes of nothing significant was a pure waste of the potential though, primarily because of the storyboarding & spread. The pacing also could've much better had they addressed the issues I mentioned earlier. — Would've a 10/10 without the flaws I mentioned. Still a solid 9/10 for the canon contents, 6/10 for the filler arcs & ovverall a good 7/10 for the entire series. But in the end, the series was still enjoyable, if not ""very,"" regardless & that's what matters the most I believe! — The first & last episodes of the series were really memorable! That said, I am onto the Naruto Shippuden now! I don't exactly have huge hopes for the series, but I do expect some obvious improvements after everything Naruto Part 1 has done to set it up perfectly.

"As someone who has seen many anime shows i have to say this. Naruto is just fine,its not the greatest show ever but not the worst either. I can see comments regarding how only teens enjoy it and to be fair yes, but storywise i think its fine. Its a classic thats worth a watch these first Naruto series that is. Its better than shippuden that i personally havent finished yet but in retrospect have watched many of its episodes. For first timers it is probably a must since all newcomers are liking it, from there on they can watch better anime since they got into it.",8,Recommended,"Jun 3, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_b059c0c647,14,568
"I know I'm probably gonna get hate for saying this, but Naruto is really mediocre to me. The story gets stale after a while, and the animation quality is poor. The biggest negatives of Naruto is its animation, and its story. The art style of the manga really didn't translate well into animation at all, and the plot gets boring. Some of the episodes are just the characters talking for 23 minutes, and that's it. People don't just want to see characters talk and not move at all for 23 WHOLE minutes. They want to see something else, like battles. The battles in Naruto are lame. I'd probably like them more if the animation was a lot better, but its not. There's too many battles, to the point where we can't breathe. And the worst part is, THEY'RE ALL MEDIOCRE. While you might think that I completly despise Naruto, I do still think it has some positive qualities. The music in Naruto is really catchy, and the characters are also very interesting. Heck, if the story wasn't so plain and stale, I'd probably really care about all the characters just like I do with Hunter x Hunter. To sum this review up, Naruto is a boring anime. It does have its few good qualities, but they're mostly overshadowed by the negative ones. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 2, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_aa3254e242,14,1230
"Ahh... Naruto. The anime that got me into anime. Picture this. You are me. You are 14 years old. You are in your physics class. You are tasked to write down a set of questions related to motion, then have a random classmate answer your questions, while you answer their questions. Ok so, you get a girl's questions to answer. You read one of her questions. The first question starts off with ""Naruto runs 10km..."" and you think to yourself... ""Wait a minute, Naruto? As in the orange dude from the anime? That Naruto? Hold on... girls like anime?!?!!"" Yes indeed! It was at that exact moment that I realised girls watch anime. In that moment I thought to myself, what if I watch Naruto and try to impress this girl with my Naruto knowledge. Maybe I could gain a new friend. I know, I know. Typical cringe 14 year old logic. Later that day, I went home watched and Naruto. Man... to describe me as addicted would be a HUGE understatement! I was completely hooked! That day I officially became a weeb! Why didn't I watch this sooner I thought. Since it was a weekend I had so much time to get up to speed with the basic Naruto lore. Then here comes Monday... it was finally time. Time for me to impress a girl with my Naruto knowledge. 🤡 I get to class and sit in my usual seat and wait for the perfect opportunity to ambush her with my surprise Naruto lore. What could POSSIBLY go wrong? ... I'll tell you what could go wrong. Exactly what happened to me that day is what could go wrong! Let me explain. We got a physics question that was about projectile motion. Projectile motion just means motion for a thrown object that is moving through midair. Anyway, I see this as the perfect opportunity that I was looking for. The girl then asks me (btw quick flex, but she sits next to me 😎) she asks me something about one of the questions where you need to calculate the speed of a fast moving projectile and that's when I strike her with my Naruto KNOWLEDGE! This was it. This was my moment. I say, ""dang that's a fast moving projectile, if only I had the sharingan then I would be able to see it moving"" and I smirk waiting for a response... She asks, ""the what?"" I reply with, ""you know, the sharingan... from Naruto"" That's when she tells me that she doesn't even watch Naruto and only needed a random name for the questions she wrote the other day and Naruto was the first name that popped into her head. Ayo. What? So yeah. That's basically the cringe tale of how I became a weeb. I did it all for a girl, who didn't even like anime. At least the anime was good.

"A fantastic anime to watch. The story is strong and pulls you in, and makes you laugh along with all the action. Lots and lots of filler episodes though, which at times can be a little annoying, but its worth it. Almost anyone can find a character to relate to, or fall in love with. People go pretty crazy over the anime, its not the best in the history of its genre or anything, but it is worth watching =D",9,Recommended,"Mar 27, 2013",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_97df3ed0a8,14,408
"Meh... I am not the hugest fan of Naruto. But let me make it clear, I am not trying to be the enemy here. NARUTO IS NOT BAD ANIME. So let me start off with the good. I really did enjoy Naruto for the character development, you can really see Naruto gets more mature as it progresses (Not talking about Shippuden). Its also really fascinating to see all the new Jutsu that Naruto starts learning and he also learns to walk on water. But also like every anime he has a goal, to become Hokage. The anime is really amusing and it can get really intense and some points, not a lot of emotional parts though which is a shame. Now the bad part about the review. Naruto gets super repetitive. The story starts off like ""i want to become the hokage"" and they start doing missions which dont help in becoming Hokage at all. Also Naruto gets really off track when something happens to Sasuke. The other thing is the english dub voice acting, it sounds like Naruto smokes like 10 packs of cigs a day In conclusion, i don't hate Naruto. I sincerely don't. But Naruto is extremely overrated, but i still think you should watch it because its not necessarily a ""bad"" anime but just a little repetitive.

"Es una serie de aventuras ninja con muchos combates y una historia algo comun, al menos eso parece al princio con todo el rollo de los torneos y eso. Sin embargo goza de una gran cantidad de personajes perfectamente definidos, cada uno con un encanto especial y que interaccionan muy bien. La historia es sumamente dinamica y entretenida, pueden disfrutarse varios episodios seguidos sin problema, es mas, el problema sera dejar de ver la serie jeje. En mi opinion, es una de las pocas series que de verdad logra integrar una gran cantidad de personajes sin que se sienta forzada o manipulada la historia, cada personaje tiene su lugar y momento de importancia. Hay escenas dramaticas, de mucha accion y algunas que hasta hacen llorar. Una de las mejores series, yo no diria que la mejor, pero si de las infantables en toda coleccion anime. Para usuarios nuevos es recomendable ver al menos 3 o 4 episodios para agarrarle el gusto e ir comprendiendo la trama, que en apariencia no es complicada, pero si que engancha con el tiempo. Tiene un cierto parecido a yuyu hakusho o dragon ball, al final de cuentas es un shonen de batallas, pero a diferencia de estas, como ya dije, goza de mucha variedad de personajes que interactuan perfecto, seguro encontraras a tu favorito muy pronto.

"Yo fine people of myanimelist.net, I'm about to set this whole Naruto debacle to rest so sit tight, get a blanket and get damn comfy cause this is coming rough and raw. Let me start by saying you need to get rid of your f**ks all of them until there's nothing left but a child like sense of wonder and a hunger for adventure with a thirst for escaping reality , put them f**ks in a basket or a storage cabinet somewhere where you can use them for an anime that is thought provoking because that isn't Naruto. What Naruto is ladies and gentlemen is a quest of the imagination and an adventure of the soul, It ain't gonna tease your brain, It ain't gonna make you fall madly in love with characters in fact more than a few will piss you off BUT ladies and gentlemen what Naruto will do is have you coming back episode after episode like a crack cocaine fiend. How you ask? Why through none other than damn fine story telling, good and at times beautiful artwork and sheer blunt enjoyment. Time for some further detail folks. We gonna start with the good and work toward the worse here. STORY Most synopsis of Naruto state that it's the tale of a young boy Naruto Uzimaki and his quest to become the greatest village leader in the history of the village (Through brutal ninja slaughter of other villages) but i'd like to say that it's just the base story (there is a multitude of and intriguing mini stories and sub plots in Naruto). The real story in Naruto is about friendship, see people, in life friends sometimes grow apart, different interests and the pressures of life take their toll and people go their separate ways, it's happened to me and i'm sure it's happened to a few of you. This happens in Naruto and my boy Naruto say's ""f**k no"" leading to a fantastic adventure to regain what has been lost, truly touching stuff here folks. SOUND It took me a while to realize just how big of an effect the tunes in an anime,Tv show or movie has on the overall experience, due to this i decided to take a look back over Naruto and the soundtrack it provides for a better analysis. Hot damn was i happy with it, an almost perfect selection of songs that will have you feeling tense or at ease depending on the scene as well as songs that help portray mystery and wonder when necessary. In summary the soundtrack really helps compliment the whole atmosphere of the Naruto series. ART A lot of people doing reviews on Naruto will probably bitch about the artwork saying it's ""patchy"" and what not. Don't listen to em folks don't do it, see what these people don't realize is the cost,time and effort it takes for these companies to hire Pro animators who basically do slave work spending days on end animating a single scene. Naruto is one of the longest running manga/anime out there so its easy to imagine costs are high. It also provides excellent action sequences and when the Naruto series calls for good animation it delivers it, when it doesn't require it, it doesn't provide it simple as peoples. CHARACTERS Now if there were an area in which the Naruto series falls down for me it would surly be the characters.Why you ask? well because i feel that more than one of it's large ensemble of characters are incredibly one dimensional with the main focus of character development being on our two main characters and a handful of minor characters and even with this in mind the development of said characters is incredibly slow. Also with such a large ensemble of characters more than a few pissed me off with their quirky ways (Also Sakura is one of the most useless, worthless and genuinely SHIT female protagonists i've ever seen). Now if there is a saving grace for the characters of Naruto then for me it would be the antagonists, i say this because the series crafts them Lovely backstories that allows you to understand what lead them to their wicked ways rather than the usual bullshit in anime that has an evil character who is just evil for the heck of it. Terribly sorry about droning on here chaps so ima wrap this review up with a suggestion, don't analyze it, don't critique it and just sit back and enjoy it, if you watch it with the above in mind it's sure to be a roller coaster ride of epic fun.

"YoungChigga (All reviews) 0 people found this review helpful more pics Look this series has changed my life forever. I watched alot of smaller anime shows in the past and this was the first ever long show I ever watched. It turns out I liked long series and I have been watching short series my whole entire life. I usually do not like main characters with blonde hair but I started this series thinking that I was blonde or something I was delusional around December because it was delusional December. NARUTO: FIRST SERIES ------------------------------ Even though everything was good about the series the story was the best part. Out of all the anime I have ever watched I was never so engaged with a series like this one. What made the plot so good was because of how long it is and to be honest even if the show was 12 episodes like most of the shows I have watched in the past it could have been great still but not as good if the story was just in 12 episodes. In the beginning the story was great but compared to the future plot it was average. It was cool seeing how the rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke started and the first couple episodes with Naruto playing around with Sasuke and Sakura was like a fun slice of life. It is so cool that all the characters from episode 1 still exist 700 episodes later in the boruto series. It is just really cool to see this. The first C mission they did was cool because you see Naruto being annyoing but super cool as well. The chunin exams to be honest were kind of the best thing I have ever watched. This anime season of Naruto was like th best even though it was realesed during 2003. Its crazy because this was made when I was born I legit was 0 years old well this was being animated even though it is weird because the manga started in 1999 this is crayz because it existed as long as spongebob. I use to think everything made before 2010 is trash but alot of old school things are cool. The chunin exam was the most smartest thing I have ever seen in the series like legit it rose my IQ. It was so funny when Naruto did not know like anything and he was just writing down nothing. Hinata and stuff was offering him questions and at this scene I got kind of pissed cause Naruto can not see that Hinata likes him its crazy. Anyway the exams in the beginning I could tell it took alot of thought. Anyway the second exam kind of reminding me of a battle royale because they are in the forest and teams are being elimanated. I was watching Naruto and this season around the time PUBG and fortnite was becoming popular. Its crazy because I thought minecraft hungergames in like 2011 than I learned about the Battle Royale Movie from like 2000's. Than this which was crazy. At the third exams when all those kids were fighting from the main characters. It really shows the personalities of the characters. Kiba vs Naruto was my third favorite fight because it was like dog vs fox because they both have animals inside of them. The hyuga clan fight was also lit as well even though Hinata loss but they got some bonding experience which I really enjoyed. The best fight was between Rock Lee and Gaara. Tbh I never really likes Gaara he reminds me of a messed up kid who has no friends. Legit I do not feel like I have empathy for this guy even over all his flashbacks. I feel like with the right personality you can make urself likeable even if you have an animals with tails. So Rock Lee when he took off those weights it legit got me fired up. Sorry about that fairytail reference. Look the Neji fight where he took revenge for Hinata when Naruto got those good speech. Legit everybody doubted Naruto. He showed his ninja way in that fight you know but I aint spoiling anything but that fight is the reason is why Naruto is Naruto. Look I had a handful of fights and though fights are not always like this. Look fights are one sided in real life but it is so cool to see fights where you see alot of comebacks. So the fight with Shikimaru look I cant say his name but that was pretty analytical and I kind of got pissed on what rank he became because of what he done because I feel like it should be someone more deserving with power. So Sasuke is really cool and was not my favorite in the beginning because I was not digging his blue shirt but later he becomes cool. In the beginning I feel like he did not know what he was doing but his Chidori was popping espically when he popped Gaaras little pimple looking barrier. Like what was he trying to finna do it was crazy. So anyway after that the fights between that puppet guy and Shino was decent not something to remember though. Anyways the training with Jiriya whats im talking bout was the funniest thing ever and how he was training for summoning or whatever. Anyways him using that in the fight with Gaara and saying how they had the same childhood or whatever was lit. To be honest I do not believe they the same. They may of had the same childhood but what about personalize wise. Naruto is cool and funny but Gaara is not. He gained his powers from birth and Naruto work hard for this also Rock Lee is lit. Bruh him training for 10 hours straight. 24/7 GRIND that is the Rock Lee way and his ninja way and he did not deserve what he got. Look Gaara thinks his life is so hard being op and whatever but no no no. Anyway lets talk about someone who does not work at all but is also lit and this is Choji. Choji has the nonstop grind on the food though. Like I love how he eats so much potato chips and ramen. Look I eat a lot of ramen and eat noodles. Kiba is lit but also I have a grudge against him because the way he talks to his dog is hella akward. I feel like this dood is a furry tbh but who cares anyway he still is lit. Neji is an okay character and reminds me of me when I was like 5 for reasons I will not tell you at all. So after the Gaara vs Naruto their was alot of filler episodes until when the gang which is Neji, Shikimarou, Choji, Kiba, and Naruto goes and tries to retrieve Sasuke from becoming evil. It was so cool seing each one of them going after a bad guy with 2x the amount of power but since they ninjas they still found away like ghost busters. So after all of these fights it made me realize their is alot more meaning to life even though I wasted alot watching Naruto. To be honest during this time I could of been spending time on so many other things but again im wasting my life and I do not even know why its crazy. I think thats it for the story and I would give it a 10 out of 10 ok. The art was from 2003 so I guess it was okay for 2003. The soundtrack for Naruto and openings pumped me up espically opening 2,5, and I think 8. Enjoyment was a 10 because of the ships.

"Naruto is another in a long-line of popular shounen battle anime in its focus on the titular, simple-minded and obnoxious titular character desiring to become his village's leader through hard work and perseverance despite being a societal outcast because of being the human host for a demonic fox. Essentially, whatever typical shounen action anime tropes you can think of apply to much of what Naruto has to offer up from the titular character being a worst case of the simple-minded hero character than Dragon Ball's Goku, Sasuke being the revenge-seeking loner, Sakura the short-fused kunoichi with a single-minded interest in Sasuke, powerful sage Jiraiya being yet another dirty old man, and so forth. It also has some of the typical battle arc tropes of the genre such as Naruto and others seeking to grow stronger, a battle tournament, and a main villain attempting to wipe out the heroes throughout a good span of the series. The series does make its attempts at offering depth to its story and characters. It explores a number of the consequences that the ninja lifestyle has with affecting a number of characters that include the mental toll being a demonic host takes on Gaara and Orochimaru's quest for seeking knowledge on all ninja techniques leading him to continually manipulate others in his schemes. The development of Sasuke's character also leads to what is considered one of the franchise's best arcs with the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the orphaned Uchiha takes on his own plans to seek the revenge he wants. These more serious developments do lead to the mentioned obnoxious traits of the characters to be dialed back a bit as the series progresses, which leads it to actually be a little more engrossing as a result. Unfortunately like many titles of its ilk, Naruto does eventually find itself getting into filler arcs because of catching up with its manga source material. This especially gets bad after the end of the Sasuke Retrieval arc when the remaining 85 episodes of the series consist of nothing but filler thus leading the advancing plot to be dragged to an abrupt halt and be left incomplete until Naruto Shippuuden comes along. The fillers do make attempts at trying to develop some characters who otherwise didn't get much exposure in the series proper, some of this working well with Sakura and Hinata. But for the most part, the fillers are otherwise non-essential viewing thanks to their self-contained and anime-exclusive developments, and you could just as easily skip past them if you only wanted to watch the series up to the Sasuke Retrieval arc. In terms of artwork, scenery and character designs are reasonably detailed and well drawn though nothing out-of-the-ordinary for a 2000s anime. It makes use of a good number of animation shortcuts thanks to its long length, but has its occasional fluid movements in some of the anime's pivotal fights that include the climactic fight between Naruto and Sasuke during the Retrieval arc. Opening and ending musical tracks mostly milk use of J-rock and J-pop tracks, but the insert tracks consist of some catchy traditional beats with the use of drums, chanting, and instrumentation. While having its occasional moments of quality, Naruto still does ultimately suffer from a number of the typical pitfalls of the shounen action anime genre from its rehashing of the typical character and storyline elements of the genre, frequent use of animation shortcuts, and having a good helping of filler arcs. I would only recommend this title if you are a big fan of similar long-running shounen action titles like DBZ or Bleach.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 20, 2017",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_ff8bd36af9,15,3610

"The fact that this show has an average rating below an 8 is just dreadful. This show was amazing. I went into this show thinking it would suck, and only wanted to watch it because I had no other show I could watch at the moment. The reason I hated Naruto so much before I saw it was because I loved Bleach and I was in that Bleach vs. Naruto argument. So no, I'm not one of those people who went into it because of hype, I had no good expectations for Naruto nor Naruto Shippuuden(still currently watching). Watching this show has exceeded my expectations by a million percent. Watching the first episode I was completely taken aback by the show. Remember, I was a big Bleach guy who had no good expectations for Naruto. However, this first episode was great. After that, I continued on with the story. As it progressed, my love for Naruto only grew larger. I loved the conflict that Naruto and Sasuke had with their own hidden demons. Honestly, I could relate on so many levels. And, of course, Gaara was the craziest thing ever, always love seeing him on screen. I love the relationships that the characters build throughout the series. I specifically love the relationship between Iruka-Sensei and Naruto, despite the fact that Iruka's parents were killed the 9 tailed fox, who dwells within Naruto in the 8 pronged seal. Kakashi-Sensei's and Sasuke have a great relationship. Pervy Sage, Naruto and Granny Tsunade's relationship was amazing. Kabuto and Orochimaru were a great duo. Even though many people dislike Sakura Haruno, I actually liked her in Naruto, although I can relate to the people who think she was pretty useless in battle. However, lets be honest; in Naruto Shippuuden she is extremely underrated and is great in that show. I can see why people don't like Sakura in the original Naruto though. The end fight scene is pretty awesome. I won't spoil who was in it but it got me pumped up for Naruto Shippuuden. I haven't watched the infamous filler arc yet and I don't know if I ever will. All in all, from what I saw from Naruto I give it a perfect 10/10. I also feel the same way about Naruto: Shippuuden so far, a show that I'm getting toward the end of. After that, I will watch all the Shippuuden filler and I will begin Boruto, and yes I know that the show is quite infamous at the moment. Final Thoughts? Both Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden are light years ahead of Bleach. I still haven't finished Bleach, and I'm still not planning to do so at the moment.",10,Recommended,"Aug 27, 2019",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bb8c4d7afd,15,2481
"Aight so people normally say Naruto is too overhyped and all that but homie went on that grind from zero to hero on god. Watching him start highkey trash at the simplest then push to progress was a ride for sure. Fairly would have rated overall 10 but there do be filler episodes that are kinda meh. Naruto is the storyline so these extra episodes can be sus. Visuals be above what you'd expect and you learn to even love it to a nostalgic point though in some fights, you may think to yourself they could have done more but not enough to ruin it lol. Audio is kinda jus like any other audio but it def matches what you see very well and gives you a good reason to watch. The character development is the whole ass reason we love Naruto. Homie was down bad and then begins to do something about it, it keeps you wanting him to get better.

"REVIEW CONTAINS  Ah Naruto, one of the most popular anime ever. I am sure many people have seen it and have come here to see how others think about it, i will let you all know this is my first review. Many people think it is overhyped but i will let you all know i personally enjoyed this anime a lot. If you are worried about the number of episodes are too long or something then let me tell you the story will leave you wanting for more at the end of each episode. The entire series consists of comedy, emotional scenes which might teach viewers life lessons. Naruto teaching lessons may be an unpopular opinion. The art and sound is exceptional as the series started in 2002. Talking about character development- I think it has been done really well as each and every character except a few of course has been given proper time to develop. So it's not like Naruto will be the favourite character as the story contains of great heroes and villains. The entire story is like a rollercoaster with ups and downs, in some cases the characters might also relate to the characters connecting to their emotions and thoughts. The only negative part which me and others do not like about this show is that there are many filler episodes. Other than that i hope you all enjoy watching the show and feel free to refer to other reviews if you think i am being partial",9,Recommended,"Sep 24, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_8d694af7e0,15,1357
"Story: Naruto is about a boy who is misunderstood and Wants to become hokage someday. As it turns out he deals with lots of problems that your average person wouldn't deal with. For example: Being an outcast, Not having his parents around, Having to prove others wrong time and time again..... The story is basically about the main character and The story only gets better within the next series which is Naruto: Shippuden. Art: The art is much better than your average shounen, as a matter of fact I would go as far to say that it's better than the animation for Bleach and No, That isn't a joke either. The art style is close to being in the same tier as Fullmetal Alchemist or One Punch Man. Sound: The Intros/Outros are something that Naruto does perfectly and You can tell from the amazing Rock n Roll or Japanese Folk music being played. Simply put the amount of Intros/Outros within this anime are amazing and It would be hard for me to even choose a favorite for either topic. Character Development: Character development is obviously there, as we see Naruto mature more and more. In the beginning you would get this immature and annoying vibe from him, but Later on in the series you see he starts to mature and Becomes more serious about his dreams. Side characters also have development which is always a good thing. Cause your average shounen hardly ever pays attention to the side characters. Personal Enjoyment: I personally enjoyed Naruto very much and Would like to thank my Little brother for getting me into Naruto in the first place. As a matter of fact all my friends we're into Naruto. From buying the games for Gamecube and Playstation to buying the merchandise and The posters and So on and So fourth. I really did enjoy the show that much! Overall: In all honesty Naruto is an Amazing anime and People need to see it before hating on it. It's has everything that most people would enjoy from Character development, Perfect intros/outros, and Overall a great story. I rate Naruto a 9 OUT OF 10 Naruto is an Amazing Anime!

"This is my first review so lets get this started..... Naruto..... A good ass anime, for the people who don't have taste in this anime or say this anime is trash only loves the anime's with overpowered anime emo boys with busty girls crawling all over him, anyways. The story: a solid 5 strait filler besides from the Sasuke retrieval ark the best ark in the anime. The Art: A 5 if you didn't watch Naruto Shonen Jump in 2012 you thought this was the best art in the world! The art did have its flaws. The Sound: Solid 4 while watching the anime in dub, with some characters just listening was strait torture to my ears. characters: An 8 amazing characters, for example, Rock Lee a character born without jutsu spends his life striving for the best of the best only using tijutsu. Another character is Kakashi hes a chill character and he has a good design. One of favorite characters is Zabuza even though he is dead great character. enjoyment: Solid 8 have you seen the fights..... Good ass choreograph! good ass fights! But the plot is trash i guess. Overall: Solid 9 The fights are to be praised don't believe me take a look on YouTube, the story.... nah i guess its good. good Sasuke retrieval ark how could you not love this anime. bruh I am telling you if you don't love this anime with good fights you must only like the anime's like non-action or slice of life or other lame shit like that.",9,Recommended,"Apr 5, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_e7326143c4,15,1398
"I love this anime so much. From the world-building to the animation. Great characters, Great story, Great plot. The show most definitely had it's flaws, but it never ceased to amaze me with the story. The fights were beautiful and the second and fifth arc were possibly one of the best arcs in anime. I wish I could go into greater detail on why this was so good, but I would have to spoil the show for newcomers that want to check out Naruto. To all the newcomers, Watch this show, Period. The bar set by this franchise was so high, I have yet to see a show other than FMA, AOT, OP, Bleach and HXH come even CLOSE to how good this anime was and this was in 2002. I wasn't even born yet!

"Naruto is the anime that accompanied me from my childhood to adolescence until early adulthood, and I feel the series have a lot of love because of this personal experience from the fans. The story is typical of a hero (Naruto) passing through various difficulties and challenges, but the ninja world, all the jutsus and emotive moments give the show its uniqueness. Every character has a distinct personality, and the episodes present you different perspectives of goof and evil, right and wrong, and of course Naruto trying to convince them to change their ways, and being influenced and growing out of those experiences. All of that is covered with a lot of action, fights, and mysterious stuff. I recommend that you watch it all, even if you feel the first episodes art is crap, because they are the foundation for your attachment to the characters. Highly recommended.",9,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bf4cd1525f,15,873
Hello back with a review for naruto p1 The story: at the first 2 arcs it was really decent but once the konoha attack started it became serious and amaaing specially akatsuki which are really interesting. it got some silly moments and fillers are really bad but its not a problem just skip them. the first arc story was just good for a prologue its gave us an amazing backstory between zabusa and the other guy. the chunin exam was really boring and a part of any exam arc in anime until orochimaru appeared it got us interested. who's that guy? whats his goal? many other things konoha attack arc was awesome got the best fights specially the hokage level fight the building of orochimaru and gaara is perfect for a psycho path character. search for tsunade welcomed a really interesting organization got us wondering who exactly are they. the last arc was really decent bad pacing but its idea is cool and the development of sauske. I rate the story 9/10 The art: really decent don't ever think of pausing you will see the worst frames ever but in normal watching its just good so 9/10 no one would feel that without pausing sound: 10/10 easily sad themes are great and it suits the events character: naruto always develops and not the same unlike some mc's like luffy. he's not the most stupid he's just normally stupid. Every side character got a backstory and a motivation and a goal which is perfect no would like more than that some great characters like orochimaru and itachi made the anime more enjoyable. sauske and naruto development is perfect too and sauske is following the same path as his brother to get power. 10/10 for me enjoyment: Omg the pacing of chunin exams decreased the enjoyment with a crazy way but everything else was enjoyable the psycho path characters gave a special mood so 9/10 overall: 9/10,9,Recommended,"Aug 8, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_101efad739,15,1825
"Over quarantine, I tapped in to Naruto after one of my friends convinced me to. What a life changing experience. My views, my taste, my ideology, all changed thanks to this show. This show brings about some of the coolest and heartwarming moments that I have ever seen in anime. I felt so attached to each character. Their best moments, their power ups, their lessons that connected to life, and even some deaths brought me speechless. I may be a little biased, since Naruto kick-started my love for anime, but it’s a MUST WATCH if you’re into shonen. Do not let the hate you hear on social media convince you that Naruto is bad or overrated. It is a phenomenal experience.",9,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2021",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_769d7baf1e,15,673
"There is no need to introduce Naruto to anyone. Everybody knows it, even people who are not into anime. This manga has become extremely popular, and even though it is over, it lasted long. STORY As in every long shônen anime, a lot happens in Naruto. We follow the everyday like of Naruto, an orphan rejected by his own village, in this world of shinobis who work for a living taking missions with their team. We see these Shinobi pass exams to level up, take missions, and fight several threats including Gaara who has a demon inside him, Orochimaru who tries to destroy Konoha, and the Akatsuki, a group with unknown purpose. Now, the story is what makes Naruto popular. I can understand that. I actually would like the story... if it wasn't so non-concise and full of fillers. Want an example? Just look at the 80 fillers in the end of the series ; or take a look at the Chunin Exam arc, which lasts 40 episodes (JUST FOR AN EXAM). Basically, not only Naruto is extremely full of fillers, even the main story is very slow. As a result, it feels like nothing happened. MUCH MORE should have happened in those 220 episodes. Hell, some anime with 50 episodes or less have as much story as Naruto! As good as the story sometimes gets, there's just too few (compared with the number of episodes). ART Naruto is... not very good. The chara-design is weird and doesn't follow any logic, the drawings are bad and the animation is disgusting. That said, the art does get better with time. I like some openings. SOUND The OST is very basic, if not bad at all. The themes stick to the Ninja theme, though. The seiyuus are good. CHARACTER That's both the main weakpoint AND the stronghold of Naruto. - First, let's talk about the secondary characters. They're a bunch of useless crap with no charisma, who sometimes show an interesting attack/power just to try and get the viewer's attention for a bit. - Then, there are the main characters. The Uchiwas are awesome, and thank god the story revolves a lot around them. Sasuke is often criticized as he is ""just an edgy character"" ; I personally liked following his path into darkness, although I am not a huge fan either. Sakura is a useless chick and she just doesn't even deserve to be a main character. There's nothing to argue here. Then, there is Naruto. Ah, Naruto. If he does get an interesting journey, as he evolves through the various dangers he encounters, in this first part of the manga he is a really annoying brat. Basically, 90% of the characters are useless and uninteresting 95% of the time, and even the main characters are really lackluster as Sakura is useless, Sasuke is too edgy and Naruto is a brat. Luckily, some characters do stand out, especially Itachi and Kakashi. But it's not enough to change the fact that the Naruto crew is really screwed up. ENJOYMENT I read the manga and did enjoy some parts. I watched the anime and really hated it. As an anime, it fails ; as a story, the huge amount of fillers and the very slow pace makes it really annoying to watch.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 14, 2018",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_1127cfe985,15,3031

"You gotta watch Naruto. It has a total of 220 episodes but without fillers it's around 100. ( skip the fillers, the good ones are in Shippuden, not here ) First off, you're gonna know the name of everyone from his village which is pretty cool to begin with. You'll find the hand seals pretty satisfying and most characters come out as very cool and chill. Each character brings something very significant to the table. The action is epic and it's pretty funny at times. The walk through Naruto's life is emotional occasionally but really gets you motivated, dattebayo! The protagonist Uzumaki Naruto defies limit time and time again, it's heartwarming. Story of Uchiha Sasuke is one you'd not wanna miss. With that said, you must watch Naruto Shippuden too, 500 Eps but less than 350 without fillers, though some are good. Shippuden is just sooo much better.( flashbacks are outrageous ) I'd say Naruto is the ladder to get to the real deal that is Naruto Shippuden but don't get me wrong, Naruto is not to be underestimated. There are two fights which are on par with the greatest fights in Narutoverse.( You'll understand once you see them ) The hype for villains is unparalled The OP's( Opening Sequences ) are pretty dope too!.

"Naruto (and Shippuden) is one of my favourite creations, not just within anime but in media overall. This is in spite of a few flaws, which I will outline along with its' strongest elements. The story is a well-paced, exciting, and focused adventure. Naruto sets out his goal from episode 1, and never strays, though he has much to learn. By episode 4, the friendship, intrigue and rivalry that will be of overarching importance right till the very end is well established. One possible exception to this is episode 2, which focuses on a character who is fairly minor, but in my opinion, really annoying. But again, he's a minor character, so it's a small gripe. Though the anime follows perilous fights and tragic characters, it has many light-hearted scenes and downright goofy moments that give it a grounding as an optimistic show. It has minimal fanservice. It doesn't fall into the 'monster of the week' format (at least the non-filler episodes) nor is it bound by being seasonal - it takes exactly as much time as it needs for each arc, and gives good build up for the introduction of new major characters, including truly mysterious and intimidating villains. Speaking of which, here lies Naruto's greatest strength: a compelling cast of fleshed out characters. Like many shounen stories, Naruto has a large cast, but it never feels TOO big. This is down to smart and memorable character design, and the time spent getting to know each one through a mixture of battles and flashbacks. This creates a wealth of characters with varied motivations worth rooting for. While Naruto himself certainly annoys the people around him, he avoids annoying the viewer. His sympathetic background, the motivation for his behaviour, and his optimistic, good-hearted nature make him an endearing protagonist that you can believe in. Naruto's perfect foil, Sasuke, while certainly part of an 'edgy boy' trope that you either love or hate, is every bit as compelling. His overarching backstory and development is central to the series, and one of the most enjoyable elements. To accompany the action is some great music. Toshiro Masuda's score blends traditional Japanese elements with invigorating battle music, giving a unique and memorable tone. This mirrors the setting of the series, which draws on old Japanese folklore and modern fantastical elements. Overall it is an OST that I have kept in rotation for over 10 years. There are some suitably badass opening songs (Re:member and Yura Yura are my own favourites), and sweet melancholic ending songs (the very first ending, Wind, remains the most memorable across this and Shippuden). Personally, I've always watched the English dub, and I find it perfectly satisfying. I've watched odd episodes and compilations with the Japanese audio and that seems good too; I haven't detected any big shift in tone from one to the other. The art is pleasant and fair quality throughout, with an obvious focus on fast-paced fighting animations. While there are many fantastical battle elements that are exciting to watch, some of the best moments are in more simple, hand-to-hand combat, where the brutality of each move is felt (a particularly good example of this is in episode 85). The show also doesn't hold back from goofy, cartoon-ish frames to accompany light-hearted moments. The palette remains vibrant throughout, which I'm sure helps it appeal to younger viewers, but is not so garish as to put off older viewers. Now, one big potential drawback of Naruto is a heavy volume of filler episodes, even by the standards of its' peers. Fortunately, this series is laid out so that the vast bulk of filler comes in the last 84 episodes, meaning the first 136 are all pretty much essential viewing and advance the story. After getting that far into the series, you're well able to decide whether to watch some of these episodes or to skip ahead to Shippuden - most of the filler is enjoyable, if not all that memorable. Another element that has been the subject of plenty of gentle fun-poking over the years is how many battles are drawn out over multiple episodes, with excessive recaps thrown in. This, combined with the use of flashbacks during battle sequences, can slow the overall pace down quite a bit. This is a legitimate criticism, but not one that spoils the show, for me at least. For viewers wanting fast, shorter battles, and a quick resolution to the story, this may be too frustrating to get past. However, this happens because Naruto isn't a 'monster of the week' kind of show (I guess it would be 'mission of the week' in any case); each enemy is treated as interesting and important - even the earliest opponents Naruto's team faces are remembered by the characters and still influence them all the way down the line in Shippuden. Overall, I enjoy Naruto more than any other anime series. It was the first shounen series that I watched, but I have still not found another to top it. While at first I was intimidated by the sheer volume of episodes to get through, by the time I first finished the whole series I actually found myself immediately rewatching all the story episodes again before moving on to Shippuden! It remains a heartening, life-affirming story that I continue to dabble in, and one which I will revisit throughout my life. For viewers looking for a gritty, or cynical anime, this won't satisfy you. Naruto is relentless in his will to never give up on himself or his friends, which is the central joy of the show. If you're a fan of the genre then it is surely worth your time. As an introduction to shounen anime I think it is also a worthy series; a simple premise and lovable characters will let you know within a few short episodes whether or not it is for you.",10,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2020",Naruto,Naruto,20,naruto_bad8bb5004,15,5741
"After watching the entire of Naruto (fillers and all), I give the show a score of 8. It's not the best anime by any means' but it definitely has an endearing quality to it. If you're thinking about watching, go in knowing that there will be tedious fillers and that the show is not perfect, just enjoy the little details like character quirks and jokes which make Naruto great on a whole. In the first episode I did not like the main character, Naruto, at all but once I got into the main arc, I had come to appreciate him and eventually through out the 220 episodes it was as if I was watching my brother grow up. The show brings a nostalgia, which is something I think is very difficult to achieve, I felt tremendously sad watching the last episode. Story line up until episode 130 was extremely engaging but after that the fillers spoiled it. The art is standard, it gets the story across but considering the how long ago it was created very understandable. The music of OP and ED were outstanding, I still have the songs in my head till this day and I don't think I will forget them anytime soon. All the characters have at least one good attribute (shout out to kakashi hatake, he made the show completely worth watching). I recommend this greatly, just give it sometime to grow on you.

"------------------------------------- Naruto Shippuden : Review | ------------------------------------- Naruto. The series that sold over 220 million manga copies, winning handful of awards along the way. An anime that ranked as one of the most watched series in Japan that got tarnished by a greedy studio and has received tons of internet backlash throughout the years. Let me start off by saying Naruto is by no means a flawless anime. It's the exact opposite. The series had too many fillers. Sometimes the animation quality was below par and pacing can be painfully slow at times. But please bear with me here. I'm going to tell you why it has been the best experience an anime gave me in my entire life and dig into what made the series popular while also explaining its flaws. ----------- Story - 8 ----------- The story of Naruto has been a mixed bag. While it's not bad, it's certainly no Berserk. But what it is, is beautiful (probably not the word that can be often used to describe a shounen anime), but it really is. It's unpredictable, it's thrilling, it plays with your emotions, it's funny, it's tragic, it's sometimes downright frustrating but it is, more than anything, wondrous and fun while being able to take itself seriously when it needs to. It starts off where the first part of Naruto ended and the very first scenes gives us a sneak peak of things to come. The series eases you back into the world of Naruto with a slow paced , almost SOL like first few episodes. And the story then on is presented in a collection of long well constructed story arcs with the bigger picture stories of Sasuke and the Akatsuki being told parallelly till a certain point. Down the line this is series deals with more mature themes and darker tones and manage to execute well on most of those themes if not all. The story is mainly hampered (not ruined) by fillers and pacing issues which I will discuss below. Let's start with the filler. The amount of filler in this show is staggering. It counts as 219 total filler episodes which make up 44% of the series as a whole. The issues that lies within the filler episodes is that they are not allowed to make any significant changes to the story or specifically its characters. This being a mainly character driven plot, this becomes a huge issue because any significant event in fillers could affect the characters so they can't move ahead the plot line at all. So mostly what we get is poorly written mini-arcs and episodes that don’t affect any of the characters or the world in any significant way. This is worsened by the below par writing for these filler episode as they are not written by the original author Masashi Kishimoto himself. However, there are exceptions for this. Some of the filler episodes can be genuinely enjoyable but those are few and far between. The fact that filler can't move the plot along fuels the second big flaw. Which is, Pacing Issues. Aside from what I've said above, even some of the non-filler episodes are very slow paced. This is mainly only an issue at the start of the series. If you're into characters chilling down and wasting a lot of time, this may sit well with you. But even then some of these episodes might be below par for your taste. Once the series kicks it into high gear around 70th episode, it mostly manages to keep that pace up. Now that we got the flaws out of the way, let's talk positives. The main strength of the series is its characters, who drive the plot (which we will discuss in detail later). After the first 70 episodes, things begin to get lot more interesting really fast. The world of shinobi gets expanded exponentially, and if you're a fan of deep lore in stories, this will fit right in your wheel house because it begins to explore the roots of the world and its history very deeply. Another thing that this series does very well is explaining its core concepts to the viewer. The techniques that characters use and how the things in shinobi world works are explained in detail. Also, the concept of Chakra and what a versatile and detailed power system it is compared to other shounen series really stands out. The amount of themes explored in the series are vast. It explores all the basic themes of a typical shounen and as it goes on it delves into themes such as the nature of humans, self sacrifice, discrimination, manipulation, roots of war and peace, difference of perceptions, the line between good and evil, and alienation. It manages to deal with all these themes without abandoning the shounen type feel or becoming pretentious. Something that the author, Kishimoto, really excels at is setting up events. For example, during the early episodes of Naruto (the prequel to this show), he has already started setting up major events that happened in the last of episodes of Shippuden. In the beginning, we look over these little details and minor events and have no idea that they are going to have such an impact later in the series, and when it all comes together in the end, you feel so satisfied. Most of the times these events and twists will take you by surprise and maybe you'll have fun trying to figure out them before they happen as Kishimoto drops clues for you to pick up throughout the entire series. Same thing applies to the moments that tug at your heartstrings , they feel genuine because how the story builds up to those moments. Being a battle shounen ,of course there are going to be battles, and this is one area that the series really shines. As I see it , battles can be broken down into three different segments in this anime , The battle of wits , The battle of ideologies , The physical battle. All three come in union to make some memorable and truly great moments. Each characters ideologies and philosophies gets tested time and time again by their opponents and we can see even the main character himself doubt his ideologies towards the end. When we see someone gets broken inside as well as the outside it's devastating to watch. To put it blatantly, Naruto has the best combat scenes I've ever witnessed in an anime. I have to mention that this style of combat is heavily inspired by Hunter x Hunter. Kishimoto does a fantastic job putting emotions into its battle scenes which are backed up by gorgeous animations (at times, we'll get to that later) and a mesmerizing soundtrack, and with these combined it really sets up fantastic visual storytelling through combat. Kishimoto does an excellent job at setting up the events leading up to the fight to make it feel all the more personal and these battles often comes down to which character outwits the other rather than who can punch harder. This makes characters like Shikamaru Nara who have very little ability make a huge impact in the series. Variety of the fighting styles is massive, ranging from intimate hand to hand style combats, tactical combats, long range jutsu battles, and most often a mix of all of these! The last arc of the series has been very controversial as the constant change of antagonists has irritated some of the viewers. But in all honesty, all of the antagonists that presented had different motives that drove them to do what they do and distinctively different from each other which made them very enjoyable. That being said, the final part of the war arc was really disappointing as the final villain of the series is the worst character that the series had to offer as the villain had almost no personality and motives were shaky at best. Without spoiling anything all I can say is that decisions taken during the last war arc felt like it was done to unnecessarily prolong the final battle and messed it up with a poorly written villain and bad story decisions. But the final episodes after the War arc manages to reign it all in and give a proper farewell to the series it so richly deserves. Throughout the series you will witness friends become foes, foes become friends, unlikely alliances formed and broken, that precious character you loved die, revenge plots, plot twists, characters growing up, politics, romance, and the world itself change. It can be flawed at times but it's a full package and Kishimoto always seemed to have the ending and everything planned out from the very beginning. -------------------- Characters - 10 -------------------- Now this is the core of the franchise. Each character in Naruto is very distinctive from each other. Each has a core motive that drives them, a unique personality, and a specialty in different skill sets. And hats-off to Kishimoto for his brilliant character design as he used a very bright color pallet and made each one very distinctive to make each of them stand out. No matter which kind of characters you prefer, you're sure to find someone here that you can relate to. What the series really does well is making sure that you'll be attached to the characters emotionally. And you will cheer them on as they try to achieve their goals , watch their philosophies and ideologies gets tested , watch them break or prevail and break down crying at their deaths. You will get to see how what's happening around the characters change them , mold them. Witnessing how tragedies that's happening around them having an effect on their psyche is one of the strongest points of Naruto Shippuden. It's fun seeing small character interactions from early episodes grow into full blown relationships. Now let's move on to the ""Villains"" This series checks all the boxes when it comes to antagonist character archetypes. *Self-Righteous Villain with a God Complex* [checked] , *Money Hungry Villains* [checked] , *Religious Psychopaths* [checked] , *Villain who is after Revenge* [checked]. I think I've made my point there. But what makes this villains so enjoyable is that no one is a villain just for the sake for being a villain. The best kind of villains are the ones you can empathize with, the ones that you feel for and understand them and make you question your own morality, this is something that this series excels at. As same as the main characters, the villains too have core motivation driving them. They have their own beliefs, ideologies and they are willing to fight for what they think is right. You might find yourself cheering on the villains more than the ""heroes."" The morality here is blurred. But coming back to the war arc, its main flaw is the final villain (which I will not spoil here). Compared with the other villainous characters from the series, the final character is very bland and their motivations are not entirely clear or most likely not relatable to any of the viewers. That being said, this character is only in the series for a very small amount of episodes and the others certainly do more than enough to make up for it. ----------------------------- Art and Animation - 7.5 ----------------------------- Again we have a mixed bag here. This show can look stunning when it wants to, and by stunning I meant big budget movie level of quality. But at times the quality can drop way below par. I think I should specially mention Hiroyuki Yamashita’s work here. He mainly works on battle scenes and this man is a genius when it comes to it. Even though he only worked on a limited number of episodes, his episodes pushes the animation, choreography and stylishness to 11! Despite this I can't give it a higher score because this show is wildly inconsistent with its animation. And as for character designs, we already talked about how Kishimoto made his characters very distinctive and imaginative and how the bright color pallet fuels this. -------------- Sound - 10 -------------- This is an another strong point of the series. Yasuharu Takanashi has made a masterpiece of a soundtrack for this series that manages to highlight the intensity, the tragedies, and the sorrow of each moment. The emotions that Kishimoto wants to portray make it through to us so well because of this soundtrack. It connects us with the world of Naruto Shippuden in a special way. I would recommend listening to tracks like Samidare (Early Summer Rain) to get a taste of what the soundtrack is like. ------------------------------------------------ Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 10 ------------------------------------------------ Naruto Shippuden is more of an experience that needs to be had than just a mere show. It played with our emotions for over a decade and now it has been concluded. The enjoyment of Naruto Shippuden goes beyond just the series itself. This series has a very big community and fanbase that you could interact with. And its lore is so vast that you would never run out of things to discuss about it. Although it has its share of major flaws, this series is a journey that shouldn't be missed if you're fine with the hefty commitment. It's by no means a flawless anime , but it's an anime with highs that more than makes up for it's lows. It reaches for the stars but makes a few tumbles along the way , but the best moments of Naruto are some of the best moments in the medium itself. And with this, I conclude my review for this series that defined a generation. Sub or Dub ? : Sub is recommended ----------------------------------------------- | Recommendations for Similar Series | ----------------------------------------------- [Naruto] : Yes, the original series. It's essential to watch it before the Shippuden series because it contains a lot of character development and build-up for the Shippuden series. [Fullmetal Alchemist : Brotherhood ] : This series contains most of the things that made Shippuden great such as good character development, good soundtrack, and excellent world building. This series does it in about 70 episodes which is truly a magnificent achievement. If you like Naruto Shippuden, it's a given that you will like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood as well. [Hunter X Hunter (2011)] : A series that greatly inspired Naruto. Both anime feel very similar in style. If the inconsistencies of Naruto bothered you, you'll find a much more consistent pacing and quality of writing here.

"After an endless wasteland of filler, Naruto returns! Joy! Happiness! Frowns turned upside down! I couldn't believe it when the fillers ended. I was ecstatic. Now I'm ready with a pillow whenever I tune in every friday. Question mark? I'll tell you why I'm prone to falling asleep while watching Naruto:Shippuuden - it just isn't Naruto anymore. It just isn't the same series. Story: Don't get me wrong, Naruto didn't just magically start stabbing me with disappointment because the story started to totally go downhill. In fact, the first episode's preview with Naruto's future encounter with Sasuke had me on the edge of my seat. I couldn't believe it: Naruto was back! No, the story continues and follows through adequately as a continuation of the original Naruto. The great elements of the original story are still here: the theme of an everlasting friendship, the importance of maintaining hope, the need to endure and persevere .. these themes are all still there! Naruto is still a great guy and he still strives to protect his friends and 'save' Sasuke while taking on Akatsuki at the same time. So what happened to Naruto? Well, story-wise, nothing. I still love the story. I love the world of Naruto, the ninjas, the techniques, the weapons, the themes, the plot. Although the story doesn't present the viewers with anything deep or complicated, I still like it. But the story isn't the problem. The story as it is and as it continues, gets a 7.5/10 from me. Characters: It was great to see how much the characters changed from the original Naruto. Character development in this aspect, was great. Pretty much everbody had a new design and they all looked great. In terms of personality, well, they were the same loveable characters, unique in their own way. In terms of Naruto and Sakura, they really developed. Although he still acts like it, Naruto isn't the same happy loudmouth he used to be. He's been deeply scarred from Sasuke's betrayal, and despite all thats happened, he's still obsessed with saving him. Of course, Sasuke's betrayal affected Sakura too and she's really toughened up. She isn't the useless twist she used to be, and shes really grown to respect and care for Naruto. Character development is great, the characters are great, old and new. Sai for example, is an interesting add on, he brought the funnies and kept the comedic aspects of the show alive. The characters aren't the problem either: 8/10 Art / Animation: Here is where Shippuuden starts going downhill. In terms of the new characters and their new character designs, I love em. But Naruto just isn't animated as well as it used to be. There is a lot of repeated animation in Shippuuden. This ranges from terribly animated tree jumping scenes (it actually looks more like they're flying instead of jumping half the time, lazy much?) to staring faces and overused flashbacks. I can understand the need to repeat the frames from things like the tree jumping scenes that are filled with dialog, or the occasional flashback to remind us of what happened in the original Naruto or something a couple of episodes ago. But the extent of it is teetering on the cliff side. The quality is just going downhill. Kakashi's new Sharingan attack for example, was terribly done in my opinion. I could have done that effect in photoshop. To make it worst, they drew it out for minutes on end ... completely destroying the 'cool factor'. There are also several still scenes that consist of pure eye to eye combat with wind blowing in the background. Cool? I think not, not when pointless staring takes up about 15% of the episode's air time. Asides from this, the coloring and detail of the characters in terms of shading and such also seem to be lacking in contrast to the original Naruto. Looking at the two, they just aren't on the same level anymore. Maybe it's because I've gotten so used to the series, or because I've watched so many more series since the original Naruto, but the quality has definitely deteriorated. Of course, some of the big fights are still animated quite nicely: 7/10 Sound: Things just get worst from here. While I loved the new opening and closing songs, the episode bgm just isn't the same. The upbeat action music heard in the original Naruto has been replaced by lame 'lets make this fight seem really tense and epic' music that fails horribly. I want the old soundtracks back! Granted, the series is alot more serious now, but the background soundtracks really can't shake the excitement meter up to where it used to be: 6/10 Ok, so it's the same story, continued. The same characters, with some cool new additions are there. The animatiors are getting a bit lazy, and the soundtracks aren't making me chew my fingernails anymore. Does this really warrant a 6? Pacing: This is what has killed Naruto. Not Akatasuki, Not Orochimaru, not Sasuke, not Sakura's poundings - the pacing has killed our beloved hero, Naruto. This is the sole reason that the plot development seems slow and nonexistent, this is why character development is hard to note unless you really love the series, this is why animation is being reused, repeated, or not done at all, this is why I can no longer enjoy Naruto like I used to. So much time is deliberately wasted on mundane scenes such as staring, or camera panning that there are often many awkward pauses that make you wonder, 'did my computer freeze?'. This should NOT be happening in an anime! The amount of still scenes and overused camera panning should not be in surplus and evident enough to deteriorate the quality of a show! There are so many episodes that had amazing potential to be jaw-droppers, but they weren't. Intense battles like episodes 41-43 are completely ruined due to horribly SLOW SLOW pacing! Arguably, the animators want to avoid killing its viewers with a plauge of fillers, but is it really worth it to completely destroy such a potentially satisfying anime? In my opinion, they're ruining the series. We waited and endured just as our hero taught us to - only to be attacked by this monstrosity. The pacing effectively destroyed my love for this show. You may argue that fillers are worse and thats debatable. What isn't however, is that there is enough manga material for at least another 50 FAST paced Naruto episodes. Thats a year! Probably more when you consider that by the time 50 episodes are released, there could be enough material for another 20 or so potential episodes. Overall: Same enjoyable story with great potential. But the pacing needs to change. That pillow I mentioned at the beginning of this long, terrible review? It wasn't for sleeping. It was to stop me from killing myself from bashing my head against the desk as I watched a potentially good series slaughtered before my eyes. 6/10",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 31, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d78c3fde7,1,6784
"I am a big anime fan and I have to say that Naruto: Shippuuden is one of my absolute all time favourites. There are probably so many people that would disagree with me and tell me that Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden are a waste of time and that the story is a bunch of fillers put together. I strongly disagree and will tell you all why with this review of mine. First of all, the biggest difference between Naruto and Shippuuden is the darker tone, the maturity and the depth in Shippuuden. In Naruto, the whole series was about him wanting to become the Hokage, being clumsy and always working hard to become better than Sasuke. I loved Naruto's dorkiness but in Shippuuden he becomes serious. The series as well. Now the friendship and loyalty takes over. The mysteries get their answers and new questions take form. Akatsuki, the moon plan, Madara, war... the thrilling surprises, the horrifying reveals, the cliffhangers... these things are what makes Shippuuden one of the best animes I know. Kishimoto has built this massive foundation for us to walk on during the first half, and now he slowly digs into the core of the story. It keeps you on the tip of your toes. That's why the story itself gets a 10/10 from me. Story (10/10) Of course the art is much better than Naruto. Shippuuden has much more attention for details, the characters' outfits are much better made, the colouring and effects are so much better animated. The landscapes are beautifully drawn. Fighting scenes and emotional scenes are something I've noticed myself are paid much more attention to. The characters movements flows better.The realistic feeling is all over Shippuuden. Great! Art (9/10) To be honest, I prefer not to notice the sound at all. Sound in movies and series shouldn't be noticed. The music is there to strenghten the mood. And since I don't notice the sound and it makes me feel what I'm supposed to feel, I guess the sound is well picked. I really liked the piano pieces in Naruo. Grief and Sorrow is an extraordinary piece. But I especially enjoyed the Pain soundtrack with the choirs and dark pipe organs in Shippuuden. Sound (8/10) In Naruto and Shippuuden, Kishimoto is very focused in telling all characters stories. All characters have their backgounds and special personality. They all feel like real people that you know and they all grow throughout the series. You follow their Changes and that's what is so great and important about a series that is this long. The character development. (10/10) So, to justify and defend Shippuuden... First of all, you have to understand the use of fillers. With an anime this long the writer can't keep up with the pace. For every episode they use about 2-3 chapters of the manga. When the anime has reached too far, they have to buy time for the writer to write more. Or, they could make it like many other animes... Make up another story and end for it or just pause it for a couple of years while Kishi draws the manga like crazy. But that wouldn't make anyone happy. Please, stop going on and on about the fillers. They are there for a very good reason. Naruto goes from a clumsy kid who only wishes to become the Hokage, to a serious, hardworking, loyal friend who doesn't only want to save his friend, but also the whole ninja world from the neverending cycle of hate and despair. I enjoy the series extremely much and I hope that you do too. ^^",10,Recommended,"Mar 6, 2011",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d7c01df3a,1,3397
"First off I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end. Naruto was my childhood and with it's ending I feel like a part of me is now gone. This is the show that got me into anime and I'm grateful for that. This show is no where near perfect, but is anything really perfect ? I'll start out with some of the cons of this show. As many other reviews have already stated, Naruto is loaded with filler episodes and this can't be any more true. At times the fillers can be funny and interesting, but most of the time you are just impatiently waiting for the show to get back to the real story line. There were tons of flashbacks and honestly they show the same scenes from the past multiple times. The story can be rushed, and at other times it feels like it's been the same battle for like 5 episodes. The artwork in the battle scenes can vary from good to not so great. But even with it's many faults, I still gave this show a 10/10. ( honestly if you hate fillers that much, just skip around) I don't know where to start with all the great things that this anime has to offer. I'll start off with the characters. The character development was great for the main characters and even some of the sides characters. I think that the show did an excellent job in giving each character a unique personality and they really made sure that you knew all the characters and their backgrounds. The development of the characters was so great that I was constantly questioning who my favorite character really was. At the beginning I honestly thought that Naruto was annoying and ignorant, but the growth and development of Naruto really grew on me and he began to become one of my favorites. Okay next is the story line. The plot was pretty interesting, but very long. While it did seem like the story was at a standstill for a while in the show, the writers did a good job at subtly setting everything up. Little things that happened in random episodes sometimes came up later as being important. The plot was like a puzzle at times, where I would try to put the pieces together. I actually really enjoyed how they set it up like that. Like Naruto and his friends grew, the story grew as well. In this sense I mean the vibe and mood of the show. It starts off more as a fun action comedy, but as the story goes on, it gets more dark, emotional, and the maturity level of the anime just increases. I'm not kidding when I say that this show can actually teach you life lessons. I highly recommend watching this whole anime. Even though it is loaded with fillers, by the time you get to the last few episodes, you'll start to feel emotional and sad that it's come to an end. While this isn't Your Lie in April or Clannad, this show still will definitely hit the feels. The end will have you feeling nostalgic, sad, happy, you'll honestly be feeling so many different emotions. This anime may be 500 episodes, but it is totally worth it and in the end you won't regret it.",10,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2a418394ea,1,2981
"Oh, I hope that I’ll be the first to write the review when all the Naruto anime series end. Well, what should I start with… 15 years. For FIFTEEN years this anime brought me joy and unspeakable emotions. For FIFTEEN years it taught me right from wrong. For FIFTEEN years it … it’s been a guide of light for me. Jeez, I was raised on this anime, I became older with its characters, I just LOVE IT!!! The Naruto series started when I was in a preschool age, and for 15 years it never stopped to surprise me. Though the journey was long (some might say too long) it was always exciting and brilliant. And I am really sorry if I get carried away by emotions, but true Naruto fans will understand – this is a tale, a unique and flawless tale, of nearly all of my life and now that I look back and see that little Naruto who used to be always alone, without parents, without friends, and I turn my look to who he became through these years – the Hero, who saved the world, Best Friend that was always there to help and to understand, and now – a husband… ah, I might cry. Seriously. Perfect ending. Naruto and Hinata deserve their piece of happiness. And though we did not see this in original manga series, I was really glad to be able to see that kind of and end in anime adaptation. Now let’s get back to the show and analyze everything peace by peace. I’ll start with the story. Indeed the plot, the fantastic world, all the jutsu techniques, all the creatures and characters, everything that we saw in Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden world is a creation of a mastermind – Kishimoto Masashi, and for that I bow to him to the ground. Just imagine how impossible it was to create such a wide universe with all of its own structure (villages, clans, fractions), its own history (all the clans and villages wars), its own beasts, beings and heroes etc; and how unimaginable was it to make this huge machine work. There is everything I love about the story and about how it is served to the viewer revealing its genius from all sides. It is groundbreaking in every way possible. Now let us head to art style. Generally it is satisfying. Well, it is hard to make every episode look like Kimi no Na Wa (you can consider this a recommendation), especially when you have more than 700 episodes (Naruto + Shippuuden). But I can praise creators for really good special effects and the way they’ve made all ninjutsu types look like. And though I must admit that Naruto movies absolutely compensate lack of original shows’ drawing it does not make the original run look worse. Unlike art styling – music really is the VERY strong side of the series. From top to bottom it is impeccable. Every opening, every ending, every song from the series is something breathtaking and mind blowing. I truly enjoy every track and I can sincerely call the Narutos’ OST one of the best of all time in anime industry. The openings like Hero’s Come Back (OP 1), Sign (OP 6), Toumei Datta Sekai (OP 7), Diver (OP 8), Shilhouette (OP 16) will fire you up and make your spirit riot; the endings like Shooting Star (ED 1), U can do it (ED 15), Dame Dame ga (ED 31), Spinning World (ED 32), Zetsu Zetsu (ED 40) will make you believe that you just witnessed a dream that you never want to end. I am not even mentioning stunning Hisou, Kikyou, Sengunbanba, Utsusemi tracks that appear at very exact lyrical moments and touch your soul in its deepest corners. The chorus tracks like Akatsuki and Pains’ theme songs make you feel goosebumps and your hair stand as you stare through the eyes of our heroes at fearless overwhelming enemy hordes. An incredible work by the composer – Yasuharu Takanashi. The characters. Oh, there is so much to say. This is something galaxy lvl. Nearly 100 characters, each with their own temper, beliefs and credo, each of them is trying to make an impact at the world they live in. I will always remember characters like Madara, Itachi, Nagato, because their own vision of the world and the steel will they’ve shown to everyone is something worth of admiration and respect. All the heroes are versatile, unique and incomparable to each other. I am not mentioning the number of skills and techniques each character possesses and how multiform and complex they are. Worth mentioning are beasts like Tailed once. They are that destructive force everyone is trying to lay their hands on, but the author shows that they are something more than that – they have souls and feelings, and no one can see their good hearts under the scary masks. The enjoyment that I personally got from this show is something outstanding. I enjoyed it to the core and absolutely adore it. Maybe that’s because I felt much the same as the main hero and ‘ve been a witness of many injustice things in this life, and the anime shows it very good. The human’s greed, the way we only think about our own sake, even the way kids treat someone who is not similar to them – it is a part of the masterpiece that Naruto is. Colossal work by Date Hayato and everyone who worked to make this show to be this titanic and go on nonstop for 15 years. I personally bow to all of you and say: “Thank you for the best childhood memories, I will always carry them!” And again I want to congratulate Naruto and Hinata with wedding, and thus my beautiful dream is over, meaning that I grew up and it is time for me to let my childhood go.",8,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4698d88a04,1,5379
"Let me just clarify this now while we’re both still at the very first sentence of this review, and also, at the very first sentence of my very first review ever, but; Naruto Shippuden, and the entire Naruto series in and of itself, is my most favourite anime of all time. Yes, you may think differently, or even otherwise, but I’ll just simply state this now, it is my most favourite anime ever. If you’d care to know why, or you’re simply curious, read on. Story: 10/10 I personally think that the story of Naruto/Shippuden is great; it may not be the best, and it may not be perfect, but then again, when is anything ever like that? Shippuden follows the life of the protagonist, Uzumaki Naruto, as he attempts to retrieve his former teammate, Uchiha Sasuke, who has left the village and everyone around him, in the pursuit of gaining power to get revenge on his older brother, Uchiha Itachi, for the massacre of their entire clan, including their own family. In the beginning, back in the simple days of Naruto, it was all about the story of a boy whose dream was, and still is, to become hokage; the greatest ninja in the entire village. This young boy wanted to prove just that; that he was great. He wanted the village to respect him, to prove that he wasn’t just some ‘demon-fox child’, who was feared of, due to the terrifying nine-tailed fox that was sealed within him. And now, it’s without a doubt, safe to say, that this story has evolved from so much more than that. Everything in the original Naruto series has ultimately lead up to Shippuden, as we, the audience, learn more and more about the characters and the story as a whole. We begin to delve deeper into the core, as more enemies emerge, and more stories and secrets are revealed. Questions that have went on unanswered are finally beginning to obtain an answer, as more questions take their place, and everything slowly, but surely, begins to get tied together. Shippuden, apart from its former series, takes on a much more serious, deep and mature tone, causing us, the audience, to really empathize and act, to either cry in joy or sadness, and I for one can honestly confess, that yes, here and there, this anime has made me cry, multiple times. This anime teaches you; a lot. Shippuden teaches you about the true value and significant importance of family, friends, and life itself. Sure, perhaps, a few other animes have been able to do so, and maybe even to a higher and greater extent, but nothing compares to Naruto. The long amount of episodes only causes the audience to grow with the characters and the story itself. Art & Animation: 8/10 Simple. I’ve seen better. But, Shippuden has really stepped up from its former, in regards to visual aspects and animation, it’s improved greatly. There is much more detail in Shippuden than in it’s former, and the colours are either much more vibrant or the complete opposite, in order to properly convey the scene better. Fight scenes are played out more smoothly, with an adequate use of blood and cuts and scratches and such. Close-ups on the characters’ faces are also quite good, the emotion on their faces seem true, real. Also, I agree with plenty others, that flashbacks are completely overused. I find myself saying, quite often, ‘We saw that scene literally an episode ago!’, and honestly, it’s not helping the story so much. I understand the need to replay flashbacks, even of episodes we’ve already seen, and most of the time, I can handle it, but it’s overused, and fails to portray the expected suspense of the current scene. Other than that, art & animation; quite well done. Sound: 8/10 The openings. The endings. The OSTs. Most of which are particularly good! The improvement in the sound is evident, and the animation played out during the openings and endings are well put together, matching the song rather well. Emotion is thoroughly conveyed through the amazing voice actors in this anime, who, excluding the dub actors, perform screams and cries and laughs next to flawlessly. Great! Character: 10/10 Character; also translated to the sum of ones’ personality and being as a whole. The characters in Shippuden are great, excellent even! Each and every one of them have a completely unique personality that differentiates one from the other, and seeing them all come together, as friends or as foes, it’s easy to admit that the character development is superb! There are so many characters, each lovable and excellent in their own unique way, with beautifully well-put together pasts that create the particular character we see now. We see how the ‘heroes’ have come about, and how each of them have managed to cope and move on with their lives, to become something else entirely, something better than they ever used to be. The ‘villains’, too, have a particular past event, or particular emotions that somewhat humanizes them and redeems them to a strange extent, and we realize that they’re not only ‘evil’ simply because they are. Everyone has their own reasons for doing what they do, and who they are as a whole and that’s what makes each character amazing in their own way. Sure, some may be bland or dull, weak or annoying, strong or insane, but if each character didn’t even have a single flaw, what would that make them? Human? Surely not. The characters in Shippuden are beautiful and lovable, which in turn, causes us as the audience to feel for them and empathize, and that’s, honestly, great. Overall: 10/10 Shippuden is clearly one of the greatest animes of all time, and perhaps that’s an overstatement, or maybe even an understatement, depending on your own thoughts. But, if given enough thought, Shippuden wouldn’t have become so popular if it wasn’t great or amazing, even to a short extent. Some of you may have seen animes better, or worse, or even of equal value, but towards the end, Naruto/Shippuden is clearly one of its own. I, and anyone else probably, couldn’t agree better that the fillers in this anime are truly horrid and awfully annoying, but, you know what, overlook it. Don’t watch them. Simple. An animes’ worth isn’t valued by its amount of fillers or overused flashbacks or anything, its value comes down to how much a person, themselves, think it’s amazing. So if you haven’t seen Naruto/Shippuden or you dropped it for whatever the reason may be, I encourage you to watch it and give it a shot. 300+ episodes, along with the original 100+ episodes in Naruto, is crazy, sure, but they all add up to one hell of a story and I say, sit, watch, and enjoy the ride.",10,Recommended,"Jan 17, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a2323b8bcc,1,6547
"Shippuuden was a step-up from the original series in some ways, but it's worse at other points, making it just so-so. The story has become increasingly complex compared to the original series. You still have the whole deal with Naruto wanting to become Hokage, but that is very overshadowed by many new plots. You have Akatsuki who's after all the Jinchuuriki, there's Sasuke and his quest for revenge, Naruto's struggle against the Kyuubi, Team 7's quest to get back Sasuke and Danzo's plot to take over Konoha. Yeah, there's a lot going on, and I enjoy that a lot - a plot-rich story is always fun to watch But - and this is a big but - there's severe pacing problems. And by severe I mean excessively dragged out nonsense which could've been done in half the time... at least. The first arc took 30 episodes. It could've been finished in much less time, but they absolutely have to drag it out with endless nonsense fights. The Sasuke and Sai arc was fairly okay, though, but still a little slow on the pacing. &quot;But if they quicken the pace it, we'll get more fillers. Oh noes!&quot; Yeah, some people think that. However, I'd rather have them quicken the pace and have more filler than getting my viewing experience ruined by a sluggish pace. Fillers can be good, you know. The animation in Shippuuden is better. The new character deigns are great, and I find that the coloring is less dull than it was in the original series. It's becoming more flawless too, but it still struggles with small flaws here and there. However, it's still Naruto, and its animation has always been simple in my eyes. There are no big details to brag about, but sometimes simple works; it's mainly a matter of getting used to (and most people watching Shippuuden should've already watched the original series, which means that you've most likely gotten used to it). The soundtrack so far in Shippuuden is fairly decent. I still haven't heard any remarkable themes, but none of them has been outright bad either, so I'm fine with it, but I wish they threw in some good themes. They do, however, fit right into the current events, which is a small plus. There's not much to say about the OPs an EDs so far; they've been very average. As of episode 58, there have been low amounts of character development, and for 58 episodes that&rsquo;s not really good. The reunion of the new Team 7 and Sasuke is pretty much the only traces of any character development so far, aside maybe Sai's interactions with the rest of the group, which is always funny to watch, and it's interesting to see if he'll ever learn how to properly interact with the others. The introduction of him and his actions is pretty much all that keeps my character rating on 7, because we've hardly seen any of the other characters, and the small amounts we've seen of them is nothing special, really; it's like most of them have just faded away. I'm still hoping that some good character development and all that will come though, seeing how Naruto will probably have to struggle with the Kyuubi inside of him, and not to mention getting Sasuke back; I'm hoping that it will provide us with some neat character development. So far, I'm very &quot;meh&quot; about Shippuuden, but if it rids itself of the pacing problems I'm going to enjoy this much more than I'm currently doing now. EDIT: Well, it has improved as of late (Dec '08), so I am upping the character and enjoyment ratings to 8 To 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",7,Recommended,"May 20, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db21b847aa,1,3528
"Naruto Shippuuden! The series that would never end finally ends! After ten years, five-hundred episodes and several movie tie-ins, this milked cow is finally laid down to rest, resulting in one of the worst shounen anime adaptations ever made. While I did enjoy myself with the series and certainly found myself even liking it for the first two-hundred episodes or so, the insane amount of filler, padding, and the abysmal final three or four arcs made me despise this show by the end, and all of the characters and narrative. The filler in this anime is such a goddamn problem that it destroys the entire anime, and at this point, if you did want to get into Naruto, I would recommend reading the manga, or skipping over the filler because, for the most part, the filler is absolutely abysmal and is rarely interesting or adds onto the overall world of the series. Since this review is going to spend a long time detailing all of my problems with the story, I will address the animation and music now. While I still prefer the original soundtrack of Naruto, Shippuuden is still great. The action pumps you up and there is a great variety in songs and moods to fit each moment and scene. The animation is a different story, however. The anime is very inconsistent, and that is to be expected with a show with over five-hundred episode; at its best, it could be movie quality, it’s worst, trashy nineties OVA. Shippuuden is the direct continuation of the original series, set two years after the events that transpired in the original in which Naruto has trained to hone his skills and jutsu. Upon returning to the village, he fights off against the Akatsuki, a group of powerful, rogue ninja who wants to collect all of the tailed beasts to create the ten tails and rule the world, while trying to save his gay lover, I mean best friend, Sasuke. Now, I want to clarify first of all that I enjoyed the first season very much (excluding the fillers, that is). It was fun, the battles were original and creative, and the characters went through great development; it captured the hard life of a ninja perfectly and the cruel world in which they live in. Shippuuden was also pretty good for a little while in the beginning of the series, albeit not as interesting or engaging as the previous story arcs of the show. One good thing about the sequel is that Shippuuden is a lot darker and more mature than the original series, now with the Akatsuki clan running amok and killing many of the tailed beasts. There is this constant sense of looming danger and tension in the series and the Akatsuki were easily the best thing about part two. All of them are interesting, had unique abilities, and for the most part, are allowed to shine in their own respective battles. Hell, there are even a few character deaths which took me by surprise, which added onto the steaks and tension of the show. The first one hundred episodes of content (minus the fillers) are pretty great although I did have some problems, most notably being Naruto and Sasuke themselves. Naruto in part two is annoying, whiny and irritating, and his constant journey to save Sasuke feels boring and without much sense logically, since Saskue becomes a complete dick head, hell bent on destroying the entire village. Sasuke starts off wanting to kill his brother, and after the worst plot twist in the series where we learn his evil brother was, in fact, a good guy, which I’ve always hated, all he wants after that is to destroy the village and everyone in it, and his character fluctuates so much throughout part two that it becomes hard to keep track of. Both of their respective story arcs hit brick walls by the end of the Pain arc and hardly develop at all past that, just in their power levels. Speaking of the Pain arc, the conclusion to that very same story arc was so bad that I lost all hope in the series. After a great fight in which much of the main cast die, Naruto has a friendship speech with the villain in which after, he brings back all of the people in the village who died! This removed all of the tension from the series and was such a cheap way to bring back characters that I began to hate the series from that point onwards. Combine that with characters who did receive some screen time in part one, now being pushed to the sideline with no development, aside from Shikamaru, but even after his own arc, he is pushed to the side to make way for the yellow-haired twit. In addition, Naruto’s character is ruined after we learn he is the child of destiny and was destined to save the world since he was born. This meant all of his hard work was for nothing and is such a giant middle finger from the author, that after this point, I hated the series. From this point on, we know that Naruto can never die nor lose since he is destined to save the world. His fate is pre-determined from the start, which does remove some tension from the later arcs. It also destroys Naruto's main theme at the same time. Naruto's driving force was that hard work and endurance would pay off in the end, and earn you respect from the people around you, even when the whole world is putting you down. In the early parts of the series there was a genuine sense of satisfaction in watching Naruto grow as a person and the catharsis pay off that entailed was great after all his hard work. Learning that he is a destined child, and was destined with all these great powers from the beginning ruins all of the hard work and endurance he had to go through to gain respect as a shinobi. Essentially, the author shot himself in the foot and omitted one of the driving forces of his story. Now, let me elaborate a little more on the Itachi plot twist before I go ahead and why I didn't like this twist in the story. To me, Itachi was a great villain, someone who killed his entire village just to test his limits, leaving his younger brother alive to act out revenge on the part of his fallen clan. Like Saskue, we hated Itachi at the beginning, which we should of, since this makes a great villain. Itachi is strong, ruthless, and cunning. All of this, in my eyes, anyway, made him great as a villain, but Kishimoto, works in a twist that reveals he was a good guy all along and killed his clan to prevent a war from occurring. Essentially he had to carry a huge burden on his back from the village elders, which is admirable, but it also causes Saskue's character to go out of control from this point, and fluctuate so frequently. I always found this twist to be kind of ""meh"", for a lack of a better term. I never hated it per say, to the point where it broke the series or anything, it's just that I think Itachi was much better as a villain than a good guy. But hey, this mini-rant is just down to my own personal preference. The worst character out of them all is Sakura. Now, I don't think she is useless in this series. Hell, she has a pretty okay fight against one of the Akatsuki members and wins, which is something I can appreciate, it's just that her character goes nowhere. She stays so stagnant and boring, whilst crying about Saskue. And holy hell does her love for Sasuke feel forced as hell. It makes no sense why she loves him to this extent, especially after the bastard almost killed her and threatened to destroy the entire village, killing everyone she loved and had known. Back in the original I could kind of excuse her crush on account that she was a young child, but now it's laughably pathetic and doesn't even make any sense. This applies for most of the female cast in the series since Kishimotot can't write good female characters. They're either completely useless or completely superficial. That's it. And this brings us to ninja war arc and everything that came after. These final arcs were awful. All of the clever tactics and strategies the characters had are now gone, in favour of who could pull off the most landscape reducing jutsu, and Naruto and Sasuke become so powerful, to the point they rival gods, even going as far as having them both die and then re-birth as an act of destiny. What I always hated was that all of the characters that died before; characters that I liked and had well-completed arcs were brought back to life since the author was too lazy to create new ones. This ruined many of the original arcs these characters went through, and I found this, for the most part, to be completely boring since they just repeat what happened previously. Sure, there is some development and growth with the characters, but it's hardly substantial enough to raise the bar. All of the previous rules and ideas that Kishimoto establishes in the early part of the series are thrown out and it's painfully obvious that he didn't even care about his own series in the end since the justsus and abilities some of the characters can perform goes against the rules of the world that he established. A good example is when Kakashi gets two Sharingan which would require a large amount of chakra to use. We've been told time and time again that this character, while having a wide range of impressive jutsu, doesn't have much in the way of chakra and thus can't battle for too long but in the final arcs he performs so many Jutsu it is unbelievable and when he does require the double Sharingan it makes no sense how he can utilise its power, especially since he obtains it at the end of the war and thus his chakra would have been completely gone! Another example of crap writing is after Naruto is reborn, he somehow saves Gai from dying just by simply touching his chest! It makes no sense why he can suddenly do this and this element is never explained to us at all. Not only that, but a few moments later he restores Kakashi's eye in the same fashion, but fails to restore Gai's dead legs, for whatever reason. What an asshole! These final arcs are so full of ass-pulls, random power-ups and last for so long that I can’t stand the idea of watching them again. The final fight between Naruto and Sasuke was pretty impressive and I’m glad it wasn't stuffed with filler but it’s not enough to save the whole series. The “final” villain Madara was the only thing I liked about the final arc but even then, he was replaced by the true final villain who was terrible, since the author had no idea how to end the series nor of how to get rid of such a powerful enemy. Kaguya was such a terrible final villain, only being relevant for about ten episodes or so. The biggest problem is that she came out of nowhere. There was no build-up like Madara. Madara felt justified to be the final villain because of the build-up and the pay off with him was pretty good, but Kaguya was boring, dull and had no narrative steaks or intrigue behind her character at all. She was truly the worst final villain I've ever seen. I could go on and on about every little thing, but I’ve covered everything that pisses me off the most so I’ll leave it at that. I do enjoy Naruto, despite the obvious flaws, but if you want to get into the series, just read the manga.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 22, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db42a0cd84,1,11038
"First off, I would like to let you know that this is my first ever review and I'm glad it's going to be for Naruto. Naruto was an anime which would leave first time viewers with a bad taste in their mouth, it was like this immature anime with not much of a story to it and it's main character was just this silly, clumsy immature kid who is determined to become the Hokage of his village some day. It made viewers go through a painful number of fillers to get to a serious part which made many fans disappointed at the end of the first series. Naruto Shippuden. This was basically like a present for those true fans who sticked through the endless fillers to finally get serious about the show. It shows how deep and how matured the show was meant to be. Story: 10 (Outstanding) I know this may sound biased, and many would feel 10 is too much for a show like this but bear with me. The MC, Naruto Uzumaki who seemed like this not so tough, silly, immature kid and all he thought about was being the Hokage but the story actually revolves around him in so many other ways. It finally isn't just all him anymore, the different characters who took part in the first series become more important. The suspense of revealing the truth behind more truth is intense, it makes you want to keep going on. There was even a touch of love in the series and it was felt throughout the series. It's a story which will make you get into each of the characters but expecially Naruto as it doesn't miss out a single day of his life. Art: 9 (Great) I didn't want to give art 9 as well as I've recently sceen better art in several other animes but what made me stick to 9 was the fight scenes, the minute details of a single move, the background reacting to every other things and also the characters started to look more like how modern animes had their characters drawn with a clearn touch, and so my score. I think sound enters this catagory and so, let me explain. Naruto Shippuden has wonderful soundtracks which fits in perfectly for each situations in the anime. You would get that feeling of getting deep into the series with the help of the soundtracks as well. And so I give art, with both great sound and great animation a 9. Character: 10 (Outstanding) I've mentioned before about Naruto just wanting to be Hokage someday but the character development of this single person was too good, his reasons become more clear as he grows. This anime is named Naruto as it follows him through everyday with every other main characters in different episodes. You get to see him grow up to be a very mature young man with huge responsibilities. But why this anime stands out is that, it doesn't completely miss out on the rest of the characters. Each characters have their out arc and it's explained well and the whole story with it's well times flashbacks makes it as though, the detailed bits and pieces are filling out a huge puzzle, the puzzled world of the Shinoby. Enjoyment: 9 (Great) I had to think twice here about whether to give 9 or 10 and be honest to myself. Though I love this anime so much, I actually skipped all of the fillers, just seeing the start and the end. But that's the only downside for this to miss out a 10. The reason why I did that because I couldn't wait any longer to get back into the series, the story as it was how much I enjoyed watching it. It has his humorous moments which would make you laugh for quite sometime but there can be annoying parts where Naruto just stays silly like always but you still end up laughing at it. But as much as it has it's funny parts, it has it's intense parts, love, loyalty, despair and even hate. Overall: 10 (Outstanding) Overall, this is one anime which stands out for itself, though it has it's endless fillers to catch up with the manga, it's something you shouldn't miss out. It's one of those very matured, well developed, well characterized anime which keeps you on your feet while you grow up with the series. On a side note, the majority of the people who hesitate to try this show from what I've seen was because of the huge number of not so fun fillers. I would recommend skipping out on fillers as they hardly include stories related to the main story.",10,Recommended,"Apr 4, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_feed73f2e8,1,4218
"TL;DR: Believe it! Took 10 years and 500 episodes but it finally ended. Guess that cow finally ran out of milk! [Story: 5/10 , Characters: 6/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 7/10] Believe it! The series who was never meant to end has finally been laid to rest… or has it? It may have taken 10 years and 500 episodes (280 Cannon and 220 Fillers, believe it, I counted), thank you Studio Pierrot for finally stop milking this cow. Let's be real, all the real fans got so tired of your shenanigans they finished the manga long time ago. So why would you invest in this super long show? Rage aside, what's Naruto: Shippuden really about? It's a story about an unwanted ninja shinobi boy who had the dream of becoming Hokage and believe it he will overcome all the adversaries (including fillers) to achieve it! (But if we are being honest, it's really about Naruto's journey of finding his angry dark lover, Sasuke, to bring back home and he will ignore all his other friends to achieve it)! Jokes or Fillers aside, the main plot has two major arcs, the Akatsiki tailed beast arc and the Fourth Great Shinobi World War arc. This is your traditional archetypical heroic journey style shounen anime filled with every trope known to mankind. So if you believe it, they will employ it! The overarching theme is Friendship & Love conquers hatred & evil. How boring yet sweet & addictive. If you are wondering how can such a boring storyline keep the audience captivated for 500 episodes? The unique characters can be a possibility. This show has exactly 212 unique characters (villagers and background people excluded) and believe it do they stand out in one way or another! The major protagonists are Naruto and his Nakamas (which is friends for those weebs who don't know) Sasuke, Sakura and Kakashi. On the other hand, the list of antagonists just goes on and each successive one is more ridiculous with godlike powers & jutsus than the previous. Seriously, how Naruto overcomes them and befriends them will leave viewers breathless. Shoutout to Ittachi, for being one hell of a memorable antagonist the anime industry will never forget and should not forget, believe it! If the story and characters don't do this show justice, (it desn't) it's definitely the animation and sound accompanying it. Narutoverse completely changed the landscape of fighting style with its unique farcical jutsus that were hand-drawn and animated adequately well. It's impressive that most of the characters were very distinct from one another given this show having 212 unique characters. Fillers aside, the Cannon episodes were actually drawn well and the standard was reasonably maintained throughout, believe it! Moreover, given that this show is 500 episodes, it actually features around 60 unique OP/ED songs. It's a definitely a first for a show that took a decade to finish. The OP/ED songs are well received among fans and non fans of this anime. Furthermore, the background OST is composed beautifully well and it accompanies the fight sequence rather too well. This show really knows how to create HYPE and hit you in the feels so hard it will make even Chuck Norris shed a tear. Overall, I don't really see myself rewatching this show but I would recommend people to atleast give this show a shot. Why? Because I'm evil, no, because why not? If you are serious about it and only want to watch cannon episodes then definitely give it a shot. It's an interesting bingable show (over few weeks) and if you get tired, then just finish the manga. This show is nowhere near perfect and it has too many flaws that is just not worth ranting about it. If you ask fans of this show, they will say 10/10 but realistically looking at cannon episodes it's 7/10. Therefore, maybe you should really watch Naruto: Shippuden. Believe it! P.S. Below is the outline for all the cannon episode. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1-27, 29-56, 72-89, 113-126, 129-143, 152-169, 172-175, 179, 197-211, 214-222, 243-256, 261-270, 272-278, 282-283, 296-302, 321-346, 362-375, 378-387, 391-393, 414-415, 418, 420-421, 424-426, 458-459, 463, 469-479, 484-500 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I hope you found reading this short but supaishi review helpful.",7,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3c934ea6c4,1,4329
"It's truly the end. Naruto was always something that I considered bad due to the fillers, however once I got into it I was hooked. Story: Ah, the story. It's just filled with so much emotion and it was amazingly executed up until the Pain Arc, yes it went down, and we all know the War was dragged on for far too long but surely that doesn't ruin the moral of the story? Naruto always had one goal, and we always knew that he would meet stronger opponents, some that could challenge his goal, and Obito and Madara were those two. The later of the War Arc is amazingly written in my opinion, the Obito regret, Madara's reasoning and much more. Overall, the story remained the same and always had one goal, and didn't go off that path. Naruto wanted to become strong, he wanted to be acknowledged and lastly he wanted to the Hokage. All which he achieved. Art: Sadly, Naruto's Art hasn't impressed me much, however animation in canon episodes were spectacular, especially in the final battle. Not much can be said. Sound: Naruto's OST is the best I have heard in any anime. Sadness and Sorrow, My Name, Gehika, and many more. They hype you up, just like any OST is supposed to be doing in a Shounen. Naruto's OP''s were great too, I can listen to them all day anytime. Character: Naruto has lots of great characters. Although the bad thing is that in the war the spotlight is mainly on Naruto and Sasuke. This doesn't take anything from the other characters though. Characters such as Obito, Nagato, Itachi and Madara are so amazingly written. Never in an anime have I cheered for a villain. Nagato and Naruto's conversation really hits and it also makes you think about today's society. People kill and kill but they know this leads to more hatred and revenge, something that will eventually bring the world down, just like it did in Naruto. Naruto and the rest of Konoha are great characters, all are special and are all someone you can get invested into, of course there's the ""muh sakura is useless"", but it's still great to see all characters nevertheless. Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry is unrivaled in my opinion. I have yet to see a Shounen that has a better rivalry. Enjoyment: Wow, Enjoying Naruto is something very hard for some people, muh fillers, muh the anime show drags on for too long. Naruto can be enjoyed, if you take your mind off other people's. You have to go into it expecting something, if you go into it like many people you will be disappointed. We all know Naruto isn't the best shounen but still, when it gets good, it can be one of the best. I've really enjoyed Naruto as a character. Overall: I enjoyed Naruto Shippuden alot. The first few arc were dragging for too long, but I still managed. Once it got good, I really got hooked. Naruto as a whole is a story which has a really amazing world. People saying, ""wow it's another Dragon Ball Z at the end"" should know that in the first Chapter it was made loud and clear that one single demon Fox wiped out a whole Village. We all knew what Naruto's character was going to become. Naruto is something that will get alot of flack but in many years time, we'll look back and happy we experienced such a great show.",9,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_cfb6625a25,1,3186
"As 'good' as the normal naruto series. Reminicent of Inuyasha - characters keep running around and nothing really (ever!) happens plot-wise(what plot? There is no plot!) for the next 300 manga chapters and 500 anime eps... Will Inyasha, ops I mean naruto, save kagome, ops I mean sasuke.... Seriously.... Most of the time is spent showing characters: running around (mostly jumping from tree to tree, it seems), standing tensely, with the wind blowing between them...Very productive and oh so tense. oh, almost forgot sakura's endless whining about poow nawuto and/or sasuke or someone/something else equally as unamusing. And naruto's whining about sasuke. Had to watch most of it on FF (3 second skip) towards the end of the eps I had. Another useful parallel quality-wise, would be DBZ...Except DBZ probably had more variety in the lack of plot :D. But about as much action, except characters there stood around powering up for half an ep. Which is ALSO present in naruto.

"I cannot believe this poor excuse of a directing team gets a near 8 overall, and MANY 9's/10's for their work. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that a ""6"" constitutes ""Fair"". Meaning, this anime is better than ""Mediocre"", better than ""Decent"". (the mean of the subcategory values doesn't equal 6 because MAL lacks a ""flow"" category) Naruto Shippuuden is probably the most famous anime to the general American populous. You might consider that one guy the whitest guy on the planet, yet he's probably watched some form of anime: Naruto. In fact, Naruto is so widespread that you could actually have friends that can relate to you about an anime for once. It is just that popular. However, that exact popularity could lead it to being ""overrated"", and that is exactly what I believe it to be. The story, to be honest, is amazing. I like ninjas. I like people fighting. I like people dying. However, Naruto Shippuuden took a turn for the worst. One of the biggest changes in the show (from Part 1 to Part 2) was the feeling of ""ninja battles"" vs ""demon battles"". In the first part of Naruto, the highest-caliber battle was between the three Hokages and Orochimaru. Their jutsus were so badass, nobody of a lower level could contest with them. However, that level of power is absolutely LAUGHABLE in today's Naruto world. Sasuke's Susano'o will just eat the living crap out of the Hokages. Nagato will use some overpowered six-path rinnegan jutsu that he pulls out of his ass. Oh, but of course Naruto can defeat him. And that's yet another problem with the story. Naruto is apparently able to do everything, and WE ALL KNOW the Fourth Great Ninja War is going to end with Naruto reigning victorious over the antagonists. We already know that. So, with the lack of suspense, why do people still watch this anime? The only reason I can think of is its development of drama. Indeed, this anime capitalizes on ""Talk no Jutsu"" (as coined by Sawyer7mage), where the characters are apparently in a national speech and debate competition over the gold medal or something. Seriously. There is so much talking in this anime that the fighting gets devalued to nothing. And when there is fighting? YOU HIT A WALL OF 20 FILLER EPISODES. IN A DAMN ROW. And that is what I mean by poor directing. A somewhat great storyline with promising battle scenes is RUINED, absolutely RUINED by the existence of filler episodes. Literally 90% of them are completely off-plot and not funny at all; ""oh, they're just saving the 43rd Snow-land Daimyo/Princess/cat/dog/frog"". It is ridiculous how good the producers are at pissing off the fanbase, including myself. Nothing is more irritating than waiting excitedly for the next episode, only to realize that it is a filler. And when you hit a filler, you know you'll be there for a while. Good luck man, it'll only take half a year to get back onto the main plot (or almost half a year; most filler runs are 20 episodes long). By the time they get back onto the main story, you already forgot half the story leading up to that moment, forcing you to rewatch some of the previous episodes. Overall, Naruto is a great story and will captivate its audiences for certain; however, Shippuuden's great shift from Naruto Part 1's original premise seriously hurts its cause. The incredible amount of ""overpowered"" ninjas along with all the ""demon"" powers and the over-glorification of Eye Techniques leads to a story where only a handful of characters can even function. Couple that with the mass of fillers, and you get an anime series that is much worse than its potential implies.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ad1f65fd47,1,3605
"Love gives birth to sacrifice. It's one of the trinity of most popular animes, which includes Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. All far into the hundreds and hundreds of episodes. I finished the first Naruto series, and I'm close to catching up in Naruto: Shippuuden. So, Let's just jump right into my review, may turn out to be a long one. Story: 6/10 I loved this story, at first. The reason it didn't get a 10/10 is the fact that it's not necessarily an original story, the concept of a ninja based anime is not at all an original concept anymore. Also, there's been reoccurring issues with the plot as of lately with the manga ending and the anime still in a filler arc. But basically, the story follows along Naruto's life as a shinobi, but to take it a step further, there's added a ton of drama between characters, love interests, and how it's done throughout the series makes it such a great anime. It's an anime that I couldn't stop watching for long periods. However. The one very LARGE issue I had with Naruto as an entire franchise, and I think that all the Naruto watchers agree with, is the darn FILLER. If Naruto had little to no filler, I'd be a very happy camper. Art: 7/10 It's pretty good, the graphics of it have improved a lot between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuuden. They've changed for the better and I love it even more now. Sound: 9/10 I loved most of the intros to Naruto, but not so much in Naruto: Shippuuden. I loved the background music that was in the fight scenes or just random scenes all together. It was great to finally see an anime that understood how to choose music for specific scenes. Character: 10/10 This anime brought out some of the best examples of characters I've seen in awhile. Naruto: Immature, hard headed, strong willed, cocky, I could go on. He is a great character, he went through so much crap when he was younger, that I sympathize with him. However, I still get tired of his immaturity. His parents were killed while trying to save him, and he was sealed with the nine tails beast. The people in the village didn't take the time to understand Naruto, and they didn't see how hard it must have been for Naruto to live with that thing, or live without any friends or family. He lived by himself! It makes me mad how ignorant people were back when Naruto was a child. Naruto had to save their village from being destroyed before they really acknowledged him. Sasuke: I know a lot of characters also misjudge Sasuke as well for being too cruel. However, he is a very strong individual who has his mind in place, and is very determined to finish whatever he has started. He feels like a very misjudged character, but he's just a very hard person to read; you never really know if you picked up on the right notion or if you were completely off base. Sakura: She's a very strong willed individual. She knows what she likes and she will not stop till she gets them. She's a very determined young lady and she is very powerful. Kakashi: He was Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura's mentor and really liked to pick fun at Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura. He's a very mysterious character, but in this series we got a very lengthy but interest flashback to when Kakashi was younger and in his own team. It was very informative and very traumatic to see how sad and heartbroken his past was. Pain: He is my favorite character out of everyone. And by Pain I mean, Nagato, and the 6 Pains. Hence the first quote on this review. It was a Pain quote said to Naruto, in the fight at the leaf village. Nagato was part of the Akatsuki. I love that group, I wish they would base a new anime on just them, and how they came about more in depth, because they explained, Nagato and Konan, and their story but they didn't really explain the rest of them, nearly as much. Anyway, Pain is just my favorite character, I can't express it in words, just his actions, his speaking, and his quotes, all just come together so perfectly. There are so many more neat characters I could have mentioned but I feel like the review would go on forever. Enjoyment: 7/10 My overall enjoyment of this anime was an 7. I loved the plot of the story, and the different battles, but the overall enjoyment was brought down by the whole filler aspect of the show. I realize it's a small portion of the anime, but for me I just want to stick with the main plot of the story and not drift aside. I know I can't change it, and I know that's not the only problem with the anime.. Overall: 7/10 My overall has been updated to a 7 out of 10 because of the characters in this story. They were all awesome, and well played out. The characters in this story really saved the over all rating, because if it was just based on the story and the plot I don't know if it would be that high. Now I'm not saying that the filler was the ONLY big problem in Naruto, not by a long shot. There's issues I have with some of the plot holes that seemed to have formed as of lately (seeing as though the manga finished and yet they're still showing filler that's unnecessary). I'm becoming more and more lost as the series goes on. And now it's just become a nuisance to have to keep up with it.. *I love criticism! Please feel free to write on my profile the pros and cons of my review, I know some of these sections were short, but that's because the characters were the only thing that I really liked about this anime.

"This Anime is one I have taken to heart more over then any other. Before I begin this review I want to leave a couple side notes. This review may not be entirely accurate on account of my own feelings towards the series. I will grade it the same way I did my Bleach review. If their is anyone unsatisfied with my review, then please massage me with ways of improving the presentation. With all that in mind I hope you bare with me and enjoy what I have to say. I'll begin with my view on the story line. I had watched the original Naruto series to ensure I wasn't missing any information in shippuden. The series starts back up where it left off. Naruto had left to train with Jiraiya and become strong enough to save his friend. I figured I was going to find shippuden as bland and unsatisfying as I did the original series, but I couldn't have been further from the truth. The story is quite long, considering the show is on it's 320th episode, and similar to it's counterparts ( Bleach, DBZ and OP ) is riddled with fillers. What makes these fillers less of a nuisance is the fact that each one focuses towards Elaborating on the original story, instead of opening entirely new ones. Since the show is generally straight forward it often has many of those ""Yeah, I get it"" moments where you want to skip dialog that simply states what we already know. Small issues like this can become tiresome and seem to be the biggest issue. It seems that each episode is laid out in a manner that anyone can drop in and have some understanding as to whats happened, happening or going to happen. As for the story itself, well there's a reason this show is one of the most popular. The story isn't your basic young hero kills bad guy story like everything else these days. The young hero is confronted with an enemy that can't be defeated with a spirit bomb or a Bankai. Something beyond all other bad guys seeing as how this enemy exists in reality and is still the cause of a majority of strife in the world. He fights for the sake of his goal not just to become hokage, but to free the war ridden shinobi nations from the very claws of hatred itself. Which includes fighting with his own hatred and overcoming it for the sake of all those he holds dear and the one he seeks to save from their self inflicted fate. I suppose I should move on to art now. The art style is very fluent in most scenes and other then some minor issues, mostly flawless. In truth the animations only issue would be the repetition. Some fights will replay Physics animations of trees or rocks being torn or pushed or pulled, then replay it in reverse representing the other side of the explosion or whatever is causing things to go flying. Though the biggest nuisance is the over abundance of flashbacks. Again, this acts on those ""Yeah, I get it"" points and can often kill an otherwise amazing moment in the story. The tree jumping phases can get annoying as well, but are usually used to provide Dialog or representation of travel from plot to plot. The world Shippuden takes place in is beautiful in all rights, with differant climates and cultures that seem to despise each other due to their unstable history of blood shed and chaos. The fight scenes that inevitably arise from this tension gives way to some of the most unbelievably well done animations you could ask for in a fight. Sometimes, I could find the show simply breathtaking, other times people would have to revive me do to my lack of breath ^_^ Next would be sound it seems. I'm a subbed anime kind of guy so that's what I'll be basing the rating on. The voices were excellent and suited each character like a glove. The soundtrack to the Shippuden series is amazing as well. I enjoyed it so much that I put them on my PSP and Phone. My personal favorite being Hyakkaryouran. This theme was exceptional at building up the pressure right before some of the most badass fights I've seen in all the anime I've watched. Though their are so many others that had the same effect, I found my self attached to that one song more then the rest. Lastly would be the characters. Naruto being the main character starts out as a slightly less obnoxious version of who he was in the original series. The few years of training have calmed him very little, and though he is significantly stronger then he was as a child, He still isn't quite as strong as he needs to be. What made Naruto stand out for me was the fact that he wasn't very strong in the beginning and was quite frankly a horrible ninja, and yet was necessary. You see, though his life was just as hard if not harder then his rival Sasuke, He chooses to move past his pain and hatred to make his future and the future of his friends worth living and dying for. To obtain the secrets to peace, though he doesn't acknowledge that as his goal in the beginning, he soon accepts his destiny with open arms and intends to shoulder all the burden so his loved ones can live happily without the pain of hatred or regret. Then theirs his Rival Sasuke, who instead of attempting to better his life, chooses to hunt down those responsible for his pain and make them pay. His power is clearly greater then Naruto's in the beginning, but his goals are clouded in the very darkness and hatred that Naruto seeks to protect him from. I personally hate him, but that's just one of the connections I have to the series. With the two main characters out of the way I can involve Sakura, who's significantly less useless then she was in the original Naruto series. Kakashi, who's just as calm and collective as ever and still one of the funniest characters in the anime. Though with so many new characters such as Killer Bee and Omoi, he might not bear that title much longer. Overall this anime is my favorite for many reasons. With a story and characters that I can easily connect with. Action and adventure with small traces of romance and drama thrown in. plenty of laughs and tears ( Both of Joy and Sorrow ). A story that lasts more then just one or two seasons and continues to impress. But most importantly the ability to keep me enthralled in even the most unimpressive episodes. I find that this show causes so many different anime's to go unnoticed and that makes me happy for some reason. Could be reassurance that I'm not the only one who holds the show in high esteem. Or maybe it's just my way of drawing some enjoyment out of all the haters getting riled up over their shows simply because this show's got them beat. With or without my personal opinion, I will always recommend this anime to action adventure fans... Unless they screw up the ending like they did bleach... Who know's, I might have to redo this review later.",8,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6a24ec8720,1,6707
"At the time of this writing, Naruto is all but over. In fact, it might as well have been over way back when the fillers started in the first season. What started out as a great anime with a deep story and tons of charming characters has inexplicably turned its back on most of what was good about it, first and foremost the relationship between naruto, sasuke and sakura. And there are still filler arcs in Shippuuden, one of which has just begun. We are now at episode 95 of the second season and sasuke is still basically nowhere to be seen. The first arc showed bits and pieces of him, and he was on screen for 5 minutes at the end of it. Since then, he's appeared sporadically in flashbacks and extremely short vignettes as a way to tease the audience into thinking he will return soon and naruto will get back on track...but then another arc starts without him. And another. To top it all off, another worthless filler arc has just begun! I don't mean to say that sasuke makes the entire series. Akatsuki is an interesting group of characters, and the majority of those great characters from the first season are still present and basically unchanged. However, Sasuke is a huge part of naruto, and he's gone. Gaara is one of the coolest characters ever, and he's gone. And another filler arc has just begun. The art has also taken a huge hit with this series. I don't know if they changed production companies or what, but everyone suddenly looks disproportioned and the animation looks choppy and cheap. Sakura has a tendency to look quite mannish when viewed in profile. There is an infamous part of the new ending where Hinata's hair seems to be falling off. The art seems to get even worse during fillers...i don't know if i've mentioned this yet, but a filler arc has just begun! Naruto is also no longer funny. Well, I could sit here and write all day about how much naruto has jumped the shark, but there is one thing that should be said: I still watch it. I'm not sure exactly why, but I never miss an episode. If I had to pay even a cent for it, I wouldn't; but I still watch. Although I might stop watching until this filler arc is over. The problem with fillers is not that they are worthless (i'd rather have fillers than nothing) but that they are so often boring and cheaply done, and often stray too far from the roots of the show. There are ways to get fillers right (see Bleach: Turn Back the Pendulum), but Naruto's fillers fail. Miserably. Another %*#@%&! filler, and still no sasuke.

"227 episodes....A good point to make a review in my opinion. Naruto had its ups and downs but for me the ups were better cause the fillers weren't all that bad. Now we have Shippuuden and i am both happy yet disappointed. I'll do my best to keep things brief and simple. This series has great potential. Naruto still has his goal for becoming Hokage and being a Jinchuuriki doesn't help at all. The akatsuki keep getting in the way trying to steal the Kyuubi. Naruto is of course much older but not that much stronger as i would personally have hoped. If you also are disappointed by this DON'T drop this anime! Many things will happen to make up for it including him getting considerably stronger. Others may have dropped it based on the dubbed versions, well I'm here to tell you that they are rubbish and you should watch the original japanese version with the english subtitles. It sounds much more realistic and believe me if you are new to it, it doesn't take long to get use to it. Fillers are also a reason people put this show on the drop list. Yes, most are annoying BUT some are actually rather interesting. Trust me on that. If you don't wish to watch any fillers or want to know which ones are good then by all means post a comment on my profile. Don't post a comment randomly, asking which episodes to avoid and such because i will ignore it. Give me a range of episodes and i will tell you which are fillers or not. You can find the list on wiki if you like. The story is extraordinary. The anticipation and suspense of it all is worth it. As time goes on more members of the Akatsuki are brought forward and hidden details are revealed, like their special abilities and their ""forbidden"" past. You grow to love each member in your own way. You learn who is the true ring leader behind everything and why they did all this. There will be heartbreaking moments. I know because it happened to me once. I actually shed a tear before realizing that i was emotional :P The humor is still the same as before so expect much difference. It will make you smile but not fall off your chair laughing. Some people may find the idea of Naruto trying to do anything to get Sasuke back a bit stupid or i should say what my friend said ""gay"". I understand that but think about it. Naruto never had any friends to begin with and he was able to make some as the story went on. Sasuke was his best friend and later became the FIRST person the acknowledge him. That is what makes Naruto give his all to bring him back. It's not just a simple reason like friendship, it is much more deeper. This is a shounen series that very few surpass. Many will disagree but everyone has their own opinion. Maybe you don't like shounen and that's fine but that is no reason to not give this anime at least a try. It's one of the legendary three. (NS, B, OP) If you liked any of the other two then i see no reason not to like this one. If you still have any questions on it please feel free to post a comment and i will reply as soon as possible.

"In the original Naruto, you have a simple plot with youthful, childish humor befitting for children, as it is an anime about children and typically for children. As you near the end, the fillers can become unbearable, and everyone is excited to just get it over with and fly off into a whole new world that is Naruto: Shippuden. Naruto Shippuden is the continued story of Narutos life journey about 3 years later. Although 3 years may not seem all that long, at a crucial age as Naruto is in the anime, and the life that he has to lead, it is in fact an extremely large factor in the noticeable differences between Naruto and Naruto: Shippuden. It seems that many Naruto fans begin watching with a mindset that still sits with the original Naruto and it's light-hearted ways, and are unprepared for the sudden strifes and seriousness of the new series. Yes, it is true. 3 years later, Narutos life is no longer fun and games. He is thrown into a world with struggle and complexities befitting for his new age and the era that has begun in Naruto Shippuden. There is little room for the fun and simplicities as Naruto grows and begins fighting for his village and for the lives of his comrads. The series no longer focuses on childish dreams of friendship and play, it's begun a whole new era of the young Konoha's lives where pain and strife become evident in the role of growing up and they are forced to fight for survival and their ""ninja way"", be it peace or revenge, etc. This anime is by far one of my favorites. It goes from the fun-loving story of children and continues on with more complexities and seriousness that much resembles what happens when you truly grow up in the world and must face life's tests and troubles. This anime could have either continued on with everyone growing older but their character staying young (in turn keeping the childish nature of the original anime) or it could have had them mature with age and inevitably give Shippuden a more mature, serious flow. I believe that they made the right choice by making the anime mature with the characters. It makes it feel as though I am watching the true life of the characters- Aging, maturing, struggling, laughing, crying, and becoming who they are as a person- as an adult. In the beginning, Naruto always talked about who he wanted to grow up as and what he wanted to be- and I wanted to see him do it. With Shippuden I feel like that is exactly what I am getting. Naruto's finally growing up, he's finally realizing the life struggles around him and taking charge and making a difference instead of being the ignorant child that he once was. Let's face it- their is truly little fun in a ninja world once you start growing up. I like how this anime shows the horrors of their reality finally coming into play, even if that means adding complexities to a once simple anime. Taking the laughter of a youthful story and turning it into the tears of a growing pain as the years continue. Watching the characters go from innocent, young villagers in (ninja) grade school, to young adults that risk life and limb everyday. This is what I've wanted from an anime. Most anime stories are just ""this or that"". Simple or complex. Funny or sad. Cute or dark. Etc. But Naruto is different. Naruto is the life of ninjas from simple beginnings to hard endings. Happy, youthful days to waking up with the heavy burdens of adulthood. I feel like I could watch his whole life play out if it were to be written out for me, I really do. (I am a simple anime lover and as it is a cartoon, I don't take my opinions to extremes as some other might. I don't pick at animation or subtle issues, I look at the overall picture. So, that being said, please note that this factor will show in my review.)(Also, Shippuden might have been 2 in a half years later. Idk, I'm no expert. So, I put ""about 3 years later.""

"Another Shippuden Review by radiantfire Context: This review analyses Naruto: Shippuuden (simply referred to as Shippuuden from herein), an anime adaptation of Masashi Kishimoto's shounen manga Naruto. At the time of writing, I have watched 39 episodes of the series. Story: Two and a half years after Naruto has ended, Shippuuden picks up with fresh new characters and story arcs. Although the anime generally remains true to the manga, small fillers give the story an unnecessary drag. It's somewhat amazing how, in some instances, 1 chapter can equal 2 or more episodes. However, I do find some fillers a pleasant addition to the general plot of the series. Animation: The animation, in general, is good. Most of the time, you get decent to good animation. Other times, however, offer repetitive frames as well as poor cases of movement and facial expressions. In fact, some positions just looks so awkward. Nonetheless, I find it decent to watch. Sound: The BGM is decent but it is incomparable to the amazing work of Toshio Masuda (main composer of Naruto). Emotions and moods aren't expressed as clearly by the BGM. Sound effects are generally alright, so too is the voice acting. Character: Shippuuden, at least, captures the essence of the characters. I like how they're generally portrayed. Evil characters are evil, good characters are good. What more can you ask for? Enjoyment: As a sequel, Shippuuden doesn't match up to Naruto (that is, if you don't consider all those fillers). As a separate entity, however, it's a pretty decent anime. I'm pretty sure there'll be mix comments on how people have enjoyed the series. I, for one, find it okay to watch.",7,Recommended,"Dec 13, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a330568186,1,1666
"Naruto Shippuuden is the new Dragonball Z. Remember back in the day where it took like 6 episodes to finish something that should only take 5 minutes? Yeah... Naruto is turning into that. One of the biggest problems about the show is not necessarily the flashbacks (hey think of it as a supplement to the manga), but instead, the recaps. Recycling footage may have worked in the late 80's/90's, but this is ridiculous. You can tell that they're really just trying to prevent the show from going past the manga which, based on past experiences, is a good idea. However, fillers are better if some effort is put into them (unlike the fillers from the original Naruto). Other than this complaint, the sequel series has been a great improvement from the original series. The animation was superb and the music fits well into the scenes. The characters are well drawn, and it's great to see the battle scenes drawn well (I still cringe at the thought of what happened to some of the battle animations back in the original). The music, well, I'll admit that some of the ops have been really annoying, but I was instantly hooked with &quot;Hero's Come Back&quot;. Furthermore, it's great to see some better insight of some of the characters (which means, yes, I do appreciate some of the flashbacks). However, my biggest complaint about the show's character development is the fear that the script writers will revert back to the cookie cutter characters that they made in the past show, which just made things dull. I understand that a lot of the characters have a sad past, but please, cut down on the melodrama sometimes eh? The show is going to turn into a drama at the projected rate that we saw in the last filler arc. Other than that though, it's finally nice to see some villains that I don't hate with a passion though (I'm sick of seeing Orochimaru's &quot;I can't die&quot; routine). Anyways, here's my breakdown: Story: (10/10) Hey, the core story is very great, simple and yet it involve so many different characters. Characters: (9/10) Gotta admit, the characters are well done. It is great to finally see a better development of the old characters, and also, it's great to see the new characters be unique in their own way (how do you not like Sai's lack of common sense?). However, I'm sick of this &quot;you have no idea how hard my life was&quot; crap from some em... specially the last filler character, it's a bad reminder of the cookie cutter side protagonists that they made from the original Naruto in the fillers. However, other than that, Animation: (9/10) I think one of the strong points of this show was definitely the animation. Everything that was shown was very fluid which made the show very mesmerizing to watch. I gotta admit, one of the highlights that I found watching this show was watching everyone use their own specialty set of moves. Music: (9/10) Ok, I liked the music, it is so great and has it always make me so emotional. Final comments: Naruto Shippuuden is the ultimate anime out there for me. I will keep watching it week by week till the last episode (unless there are fillers involved)^_^!!",10,Recommended,"Oct 18, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_40accff41d,1,3133
"Naruto Shippuuden Story(9) Well, to begin with, the main thing is still the same as in Naruto: Getting Sasuke back. But, the difference is that there are new enimies, some which you've already seen and really fight now and some you haven't which makes the story a lot more interesting. And there are some new good guys as well. Of course there are fillers(the makers of Naruto seem to do that a lot) but they are still beter than the ones in Naruto and really have a story. But....at episode 90, there starts a filler which is very boring(till 94). They could have done it in 2, maybe 1 episode, but they have to put in in 4 or 5 episodes, and when you have to wait one week, and you know that the coming episode will be boring, well, it sucks. But don't skip it, because it still is cool. And it's a lot better when you can get through it in a few days. Art(9) The art is nearly the same as in Naruto and it is still very good. Everything is done very good and looks nice, and makes the action feel a lot more reel. Sound(9) There are some new sounds in Naruto Shippuuden, but they sound-alike a lot. And the sounds in Naruto were good, so these are too. Character(9) As I had already said, there are some new, cool characters and of course you have the old ones. A very good thing is that they are introduced one by one, and not all at once. That keeps it a little mystery. You just want to know how they look like and what kind of new things they all can do. A very good thing about Naruto Shippuuden is, that not only Naruto is in the spotlight. other characters get a chance as well. Enjoyment(10) Naruto was the first anime I've ever watched, so I couldn't wait to start watching Naruto Shipuuden. And I didn't, because they had already made like 40 episodes or something. xD Just as in Naruto there will be a lot of fighting and training, what is even better than in Naruto(sometimes) and what makes it really great to watch. Overall(9) Well, I can only say that Naruto Shippuuden is a great anime and that the fillers are good as well, so don't be scared by that. ;P",9,Recommended,"Jan 19, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e59fcedd7c,2,2074
"Yes, I'm writing a Shippuuden review. Why? I really don't know myself. Well screw that, lets get into the review. I read most of the other reviews to get an idea of what others are saying so I don't add to the pile of redundancy, and I see that many people have &quot;tried to love Shippuuden&quot;. After watching Naruto when I was 13 and loving it, I watched other animes and realized that Naruto was far inferior to most other quality animes. Yet, because I loved Naruto so much back then (It was my first anime), the thought of an amped-up, older, maturer, badass-er Naruto tickled my anime tooth (or something like that). The first thing that excited me about Shippuuden was &quot;YES! THE FILLERS ARE OVER! Now we can have some actual plot movement!&quot; The unfortunate truth: You're not gonna be getting any of that soon... Naruto Shippuuden feels like it could be going twice as fast, wasting half as much time, and developing characters like no tomorrow. Maybe no one has any ideas about what happens after the Sasuke issue is settled, so they're stalling. It certainly feels like that, and as the episodes drag on, I feel like im drifting farther from understanding the characters, who could be wonderfully developed. I had set my standards high for the new Naruto, but the only thing that happened in the years that I waited was I got older, the characters got older, the plotline got moldier, the fillers got bolder, and the enjoyment got colder. It feels like even sub-main plotlines are becoming fillers, which is a shame. Naruto has such potential because of its diversity and huge fanbase, but the sad truth is that shippuuden is not much different from the old naruto. Now that all the bad stuff is out of the way, the anime is not horrible. Its still a good anime, there's just not that special shine that you find in that anime that you usually weren't expecting. Naruto has an unbelievable amount of hype for younger kids, so if you're looking for something more mature, turn away. If you're a young viewer that just started on anime (who I doubt would be reading this, but nonetheless...) look no further than naruto. Again, its not a bad anime, its just slow, and you have to be patient.

"I don't know where to start, this show is outstanding. People have an annoying habit of talking down all the popular anime, and in some cases, popular anime does not deserve all the fame. But here I cant think of anything to talk down on! (Besides fillers of course.) But anyway, Naruto Shippuden has many strong points, characters, story, music, I cant think of an any elements to this anime that have dissatisfied me. It has a perfect balance of comedy and seriousness. Its still there although the comedy starts to fade off a bit in Shippuden, but thats because so much is going on! The characters, are very easy to become attached too. The Shinobi world is full of great people, each with their own quirk or trait to better the series. The most rewarding aspect of Naruto is probably the way all of the characters, especially Naruto, grow. Coming back from the time skip from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden, you really see the characters change. Even from early Shippuden to current Shippuden, Naruto and all his friends have evolved into outstanding ninja. It really motivates me, when I see Naruto accomplish near impossible feats, when he started as such a knucklehead. My favorite thing about Naruto is that he changes all the people he meets. The author gave his character a unique way with words that makes him even more interesting! The villains, truly project the evils of the ninja world. If there's a bad character, he's bad. They have you fearing them even though they're not real. They always seem invincible, which is the scariest part. The plot is great. There are so many things about this show that have went unanswered for so long, and the writer does such a great job of tying them all together! The plot progresses smoothly and quickly, the episodes are 23 min, but feel like 5. The twists are unforeseeable, and catch you off guard, yet at a certain degree, are slightly predictable. The foreshadowing is great. Something is said, than 100 episodes later something happens and you immediately think of the quote 100 episodes earlier. There are also so many powerful moments. I'll admit in a lot of the heart warming scenes I've cried. The best part is there's tears of joy and tears of sadness. The story really causes you to feel for the characters. The emotional/moral lessons you can get out of this are stronger than ANY anime I've seen. The fight scenes, 10/10. Each one conveys a unique message about life itself, and they are all powerful.They were all quite motivating imo. The theme of hatred runs throughout the story, and you see the clear differences of those who choose the path of hate, and those who don't. It also has great re-watching value, partly because you see all the foreshadowing. There are so many episodes, and a great number of them were memorable. Soundtrack was great, I loved the openings and endings. It was a pleasure to listen to them before and after each episode. If there's any advice I have for this show, don't go through it too fast. The show has somewhat delayed gratification. It's hella good when you take it slow. You can't rush straight into it. I'm going to be honest, it's probably way better to people who watched Naruto as kids, because they grew up, with him. They watched him grow and mature just as they did themselves, so it's extra special. But nonetheless, Naruto Shippuden is a great ride, and anyone can love it. I'd reccomend it to anyone whose already watched the original naruto series.It really is worth the time.",10,Recommended,"Nov 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4c18a52055,2,3493
"Back in high school, I was an avid Naruto fan. I discovered the series when I was 14 years old and binged it all in 2 weeks, and started Shippuuden soon after. I loved it at first, and revered it during the Pain arc, but soon after I found the show started to decline in quality. And now looking back, I find the show had pretty serious problems throughout its run. Just to get this out of the way, the egregious amounts of filler amidst very few canon episodes as well as a lot of episodes consisting of 70% flashbacks and 30% actual content is seriously off-putting. Yes, I know Naruto spent his childhood alone on a swing-set; no, I don't have to see that scene for the billionth time. These aspects became so unbearable that I (and many of my friends) ended up dropping the show halfway through the Great War arc and just read the manga chapters whenever they would come out. Doing this made me realize how poorly the pacing and execution of that last arc was handled, and when I eventually went back to catch up on what I missed, I wasn't surprised to find these errors hadn't been rectified at all. I think there's a common theme to be had in considering the series that is Shippuuden: inconsistency. In almost every aspect here, Naruto excels at some point in time and then fails to deliver otherwise. The series is definitely one of highs and lows, and I think the lows have overwhelmed whatever high points the series ever had. Story: 6/10. Our first look at the inconsistency of Shippuuden is targeted at how the various arcs vary in quality and immersion. I want to talk about what I consider the highest point and lowest point of the series: the Pain arc and the Great War arc (respectively). The Pain arc was a beautifully told story focusing on themes of abandonment, true peace, war, perseverance and acceptance. We saw amazing character development in Naruto: from the loss of his mentor/friend/father-figure to his ability to finally surpass his limitations and become a great ninja, it seems this was what the whole show had been built up to. Furthermore, we had an amazing villain to complement Naruto: Pain. A rather intriguing villain who we can empathize with, Pain and his tragedy really helped build on the themes of the arc. He challenged Naruto, both in physical prowess and personal philosophy, and through it all Naruto was able to learn what he holds dear. All in all, a really great arc; not without its flaws, but still a great story well told. Then comes the Great War arc, which is 1) too drawn out, 2) ignores character development and replaces it with obscure power-ups, 3) ignores 99% of the interesting cast to focus only on characters with special eye powers and Naruto, 4) has too many villains, each one diluting the significance of the other. This arc didn't need Kaguya. Obito and Madara were fine villains on their own, and whatever themes the arc wanted to handle could've been well done using only them. Once Kaguya is introduced, we go into the territory of power creep, bs powerups and no one being able to keep up with the villain unless 1) they're a main character like Naruto, 2) they have special eyes like Sasuke, or 3) they randomly get god powers (i.e. both Naruto and Sasuke). Chakra was such a great power system in the original Naruto that didn't model rather one-dimensional power systems, lie Ki in DBZ. It seems now that chakra unfortunately devolved into becoming glorified Ki. As an aside, if you watched this arc while it was airing and stuck through it, I'm not sure how you did it. I watched this arc while I was an avid fan of Naruto and ignored every criticism of it, and even then I had to drop it for a time to read the manga before I could eventually get back to watching it. The filler; the flashbacks; the slow pacing: all of these put me off. When an episode is 15 minutes flashback and 5 minutes of actually story progression, the show loses sight of where it wants to go and just becomes something that beats already explored themes and concepts down your throat. Art: 5/10. Inconsistent once again. Some scenes are downright shoddily drawn and bland. I understand that long running shounen tend to have this problem, and we see it a lot in shows like DBSuper and One Piece, but it still holds that the art leaves something to be desired. The show does have its moments with some pretty aesthetic character designs and well animated fights. The Pain fight is an example of pretty bad art at times, but amazing animation. Sound: 9/10. The OST for Naruto is pretty freaking great. However, given that the show has around 20 openings and endings (maybe even more, I haven't counted), there have been a fair share of really bad and really good songs. Character: 5/10. After the Pain arc, we see character motivations start to morph into one-dimensional determinations or become outright forgotten. The biggest offender is the Great War arc, which takes away 99% of an interesting cast to focus solely on Naruto and Sasuke and their bs powerups. Also, imo, Sasuke is probably the worst written character in the show. I don't want to get into an entire essay on why I think this (because trust me, I could), so I'll just list out some of my points for why I really despise him and the writing that surrounds him and his circumstances. 1) The love relationship between him and Sakura makes no sense. They literally have no chemistry together. 2) Itachi gives up his life to ensure his brother can live in peace, and Sasuke decides to start a war to honor him. Way to respect your brother's wishes. Alright buddy. 3) Dude causes grief to literally every character in the show, then pops up like it's nobody's business during the war and lets it slide that he's going to become Hokage. I actually had to pause because I burst out laughing. Did he really think he'd be taken seriously? 4) His overbearing arrogance borders on stupidity. He attacks a 5 kage summit, ignores advice from others and then cries about the arrogance of the leaders of the hidden leaf who put Itachi through pain. You're not any better, dude. 5) My last point, his undeserved strength and the fact that his relevance to the plot hinges on that alone. Without his eyes, he would be NOTHING. Everything special about him comes from Kishimoto giving him powerup after powerup; atleast in Naruto he had to work for things like Chidori. Now, he can just fire off infinite Chidoris, summon black flames that never go out and eventually conjure up a gigantic Titan made of chakra to dispose of enemies. Enjoyment: 5/10. My enjoyment, as well, was inconsistent: it varied a lot while watching, from downright bored to immensely engaged. I consider the Pain arc the highest point of the series and one of the best arcs in shounen, and that arc alone deserves a 9/10 at the very least. But after that, I'm afraid the show went through a downward spiral and destroyed itself with the final arc. Overall: 5/10. + Pain arc + Everything up to the Pain arc is somewhat interesting - Show falls into a downward spiral after the Pain arc and crumbles during its final arc - The diverse and interesting cast is underused in the final arc - Chakra loses its nuance - Fights after Pain become a matter of who can stack on more god power + eye powers to win - Some sub-plots are entirely ignored and never answered in the show. If you really want to watch Naruto, you might have a better time now that you can skip the filler, but the pacing still leaves something to be desired. At the very least the manga fixes the pacing problem somewhat, but I still find it fails to deliver in terms of story and characters. All in all, the show was a major disappointment.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 10, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_de5a2c94b7,2,7682
"I was a little late to the Naruto party, i started watching the anime 3 years ago. I immediately fell in love with it. I was cranking out 20+ episodes in a day consistently with ease. As many people have surely mentioned, the fillers can be a bit much at times and they can also seem extremely repetitive and for someone who was not watching the series week by week ( or maybe even for them as well) it can be a bit frustrating and sometimes i found myself skimming though certain fillers. Putting aside the fillers, the story line for this series was very nice, in my opinion. I very much enjoyed the fighting scenes and also enjoyed the transitions from huge fights to normal life back at the village. It was a nice blend of both. The comedic aspect was really good as well. Its tough to write without giving examples from the show, but i don't wanna spoil anything for anyone looking to watch it. Overall this was an amazing series and it feels weird to me that its over. I had my ups and downs with it but i always came back to watch more. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a long series to watch, beware of the filler sections however. I feel this is an anime everyone should try to watch ( whether you watch it all or not). Believe it!",9,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_65bce11910,2,1260
"""I will bring Sauske back no matter what!"" That quote pretty much sums up a lot of Naruto Shippudean and people who read this review if you haven't watched Naruto then I suggest you watch it because there are somethings you need to know before starting Naruto Shippudean because Naruto Shipudean contains spoliers if you haven't watched Naruto. Naruto Shippudean is a new story that revolves around Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno's adventures and their search for Sauske Uchiha after he defected from Konoha in order to gain Orchimaru' power. There are two new characters that join in Naruto Shippudean which is Yamato and Sai. The plot also involves the active Akatsuki in their quest to obtain all of the tailed beasts. The art style of this anime is really different compared to the first episode of Naruto. In Naruto it was kind of a little bit cartoony a little bit but it still looked like anime. In Naruto Shippudean the art style was newer and the effects were a lot better in Naruto Shippudean. The Characters in the story there is a lot of them but I am going to focus on the main characters. Naruto has the Nine Tails inside of him. He ultimately gets stronger because He is so obessed with getting Sauske back so Sauske is getting him stronger and making him move further. Sakura Haruno is a girl from Team 7 or apart of Naruto’s team. She has gotten stronger because she was trained by the 5th hokage Tsunade who is strong in the previous Naruto series she was obessed with Sauske and practically was in love with him but she was a weak character but now I see her getting stronger. Sauske Uchiha was a former Leaf Village Ninja who decided to wanted to gain more power so he joined Orchimaru and Orchimaru trained him a lot and how he got stronger is because of his hatred towards his brother Itachi and he wanted to kill him because of what Sauske think Itachi did. My overall enjoyment for Naruto Shippudean is that it’s a very good show and if you liked Naruto then I suggest you watch this show because Naruto gets a lot better and stronger. There are things that happen in the anime that will shock you or you didn’t know about different characters but Naruto Shippudean has a lot of in depth fillers about some characters past and I won’t spoil anything because that is for you to find out yourself. The show is still airing as of now and the way things are unfolding is pretty good. Overall if you liked Naruto I highly recommend Naruto Shippudean.",10,Recommended,"Jul 7, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_35daa11a03,2,2471
"Naruto: Shippuuden review Naruto: Shippuuden is one of the most famous anime of all time, but sometime, being famous doesn’t mean it is good. People generally just base their opinion on what they liked but not on what they disliked about Naruto so that’s why you might have heard that it is a good show. If people love so much this anime, it is basically just because they found it entertaining or because they grew up with it, but if we look at it objectively we can clearly see that it is a huge waste of time and attention. First, the main story line is about Naruto dealing with Obito’s past. Let me explain myself, Obito was in love with a girl called Rin when he was around twelve years old. That girl died because she had a beast sealed inside of her that was supposed to destroy her village. Instead of coming back to Konoha, she decided to kill herself to save some life. Even if she suicides, Obito couldn’t bear it so since that day he decided to avenge her by destroying the ninja world. Naruto will have to counter all his plan to save the ninja world and his precious comrades. So what sucks about this is that Obito is now a lot older and still didn’t get over it, which is just stupid. Almost everything that’s going to happen in this anime was indirectly or directly because of that incident that happened many years ago. It is so exaggerated, the Akatsuki exist because of Obito and there will be another Great Ninja War that last for more than the half of the anime (which is 500 episodes!). Second, the psychology of all the characters is messed up. You will learn the story of a lot of them and it might seem like a good thing at the beginning because it justified the fact that some of them are evil. In facts, it makes the anime last a lot longer for no reason because they all have the same story. There is more than one hundred characters and none of them has a unique story, including Naruto they are all thinking the same way so they all doing the same thing. Here’s a few of the characters story that you’ll see many times: 1. The character loses someone he holds dear, so he will want to avenge him by destroying the responsible and his village (Ex: Obito, Nagato, all the member of the Akatsuki) 2. The character is a total failure for martial arts and has a genius (a genius in Naruto is only someone who his not totally stupid cause they are honestly never doing anything smart) in his team, so he’ll try to surpass him and become hokage (Ex: Obito, Naruto, Guy sensei). Third, as I said before it is too long for no reason, but not only because of all the unnecessary character’s story. A fight in Naruto: Shippuuden can last for many episodes because of all the efforts of the director that wanted to make it epic. I remember that fight against Orochimaru that was like 4 episodes and two of them were basically Naruto standing in the middle of a bridge just to show the power of his beast and Orochimaru talking to Naruto in beast form that can’t answer him back. All the things that Orochimaru said were useless, it was only a reaction to Naruto’s power. Another proof of that is clearly the Ninja war that last for hundreds of episodes. Every time that Naruto’s side finally succeed at beating Obito or Madara, there will be a stupid reason for them to come back with more strength. You’ll see that those two will be beaten two or three times each, but there’s always an excuse for them to recover. Fourth, there are a lot of character (especially girls) that are useless. Sakura for example which should be one of the three principal characters after Naruto and Sasuke isn’t doing anything and gives nothing to make the story go further. She is only in love with Sasuke since she saw him and always try to stop Naruto that want to bring him back to the village. Pretty much every female Ninja student in this anime exist because they love someone or just because some teams miss a girl. Even the Hokage (the chief of the village) is useless. She is one of the most unqualified person to take that role. She is very weak and dumb, the only thing she knows to do is how to lose a fight and give orders, but again she is a girl and her team needed one when she was young. Fifth, Naruto’s way of thinking just doesn’t make sense. He is always saying that what he wants the most is to protect his friends, but you’ll see that he will excuse Obito for killing a lot of them and his parents just because the guy said that he hoped for Naruto to become Hokage. All the bad things that happened to Naruto were in some way because of Obito and he wants to forgive him because of some worthless words? That is ridiculous! Normally I wouldn’t waste time on one specific characters like this, but it is the main one, so I think it is worth mentioning. To conclude, I think that Naruto: Shippuuden only has one quality, it is entertaining. Unfortunately, this one isn’t enough to make this anime a good one because of all the defaults that it has. If you are looking for an anime that has a good story, good characters, relationships with real feelings or some interesting psychology, you are not at the good place because it is too simple, too repetitive and doesn’t feel real for a bit. If you are interested, I can suggest you Katanagatari which has some theme in common with Naruto: Shippuuden but certainly a lot more mastered. Also, you can go look at Ranma ½ that inspired Naruto, a little bit too much in my opinion (It is a lot better, but not a masterpiece).",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 29, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3a76e283e4,2,5492
"A continuation from the old Naruto. While only the first 2 episodes are fillers, the remaining ones progress very slowly, probably an attempt to avoid the filler season like the first generation Naruto. Honestly, the slow plot development is worse than having fillers, because it makes each episode much less enjoyable. Conversation between characters( that do not really contribute to the plot) take up easily a third of the air time of each episode. The fighting scenes can best be described as \'same old\', apart from the intro of very limited new skills/techniques. On a more positive note, the opening theme showed great improvement over the first generation. If you haven\'t started watching the new season, don\'t- read the manga instead.",7,Recommended,"Jul 20, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6217b15199,2,746
"TL;DR + some OP and ED songs + short-living cool moments - fillers and flashbacks - visuals, all of them - overused sound assets - pacing and episode direction Story Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable. Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination. Art Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the ""characters move so fast""... Right. Background images could be split into 3 types - trees, village, cave. None of these are eye candies really. Sound Personally, more often than not I enjoyed opening and ending songs. What's worse though are background sounds. Don't get me wrong, they're not terrible, but they were nice to listen to the first million times. They've become something like a trademark now and watching the episodes muted wouldn't wouldn't make any difference as you can easily guess what'll play. Voice acting has been ok at best. Naruto is still voiced by a lady. Character Characters didn't change at all at start, except they grew bigger and stronger. A lot later there's some development going on, but only between 2 main characters. It's still very refreshing to see though. So basically, Naruto is still gutsy dude who wants to be the very best and Sasuke is still darkness. That's about it. Enjoyment I enjoyed few nice battles or moments. Unfortunately, most of these were partially or completely destroyed by horrible pacing and animation. Most of the rest can be easily skipped. Overall Started off as ""ok"", but for a long time now, this show has been a mass produced garbage made just to milk more money from fans. The only way an episode can keep my attention is if I triple the playback speed. I suggest you watch this ONLY if you haven't seen the previous season and stop as soon as you start getting bored, because trust me, it will only get worse. Whether we like it or not, Naruto is a big piece of anime history and it shold be experienced by all fans (at least a bit).",3,Not Recommended,"Feb 28, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7d7a0bc257,2,2804

This anime is much better then the first series (naruto) the story is much more interesting and the fight scenes are much better also. The fillers do get annoying in Shippuuden but not nearly as annoying as Naruto's fillers did. Naruto Shippuuden is a typical shounen anime and I don't think that any of them should really get 10 overall. But Naruto/ and Shippuuden has just a warm and interesting story that you just cant help but love.

"Naruto Shippuuden. One of the most popular anime series to ever be created. But did you see what I said? I said popular. Not best, not deepest, and not the saddest. But it is far from being, and I mean far, a bad anime. I came on to MAL completely surprised when I saw that it was rated #510, and even more so that Naruto was #800 something. I sat and thought ""why in the world is it rated so low?"". I looked around on MAL for a little while, and I figured out that there are a couple reasons it is so bagged on. 1. Filler. People decide that because Naruto has more filler than the other ""Big 3"" that it has a horrible plot and deserves a 5 for a score. To you people that do that, you should be ashamed. Where do you get off rating a wonderful anime like this one, a 5 because you think there are too many fillers? It's just stupid, honestly. 2. People like to throw rocks at things that shine. I've talked to people who, no joke here, rate low because it is popular. That isn't as common here, but I still see it. and 3. People come in to Naruto already thinking they're going to hate it. News flash, if you come in like that, you come in looking for flaws. And trust me, you will find flaws, Naruto is definitely not perfect. Although, those flaws don't merit this anime the score it has here. That's all I wanted to say. I didn't come here to talk up Naruto, I came to defend it. And sure, you can call me a fanboy. You'd be right, but I'm not so ""fanboyish"" to let it get in the way of my judgment. I've decided that I wont make this into a ""real"" review because I'm satisfied with the other reviews.

"Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series. And the end of the ninja drama and misteries is still distant. This is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation. If you are a fan of anime's such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, One Piece, Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai 7, Pokemon. There is a massive possibility you will like it Shippuden. If you have watched the first series then you will adore it as in my opinion this sequel is even better.

"[Story] Great story, won't put too much because I wouldn't want to spoil anything. The story of Naruto Shippuden follows a few years after the events of the original series. Naruto, the main protagonist, is a ninja that everyone loves. He is goofy, nice, not always the sharpest tool in the shed, but determined to help the people he cares about and gain the respect of the people in his village, never straying from his path to become the Hokage. (Hokage = Leader of the village) Naruto is a Jinchuuriki, or a person who has one of the nine mystical tailed beasts sealed inside of him. This often caused him great grief and sorrow early on in his life because the villagers feared and hated him for what he was. He occasionally has bouts with the nine-tailed beast inside of him, usually over control of his body and the use of it's evil power or chakra. In Shippuden, a lot of the focus is geared towards the Akatsuki, an evil organisation with a plan (not revealing) and Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" Sasuke. I'm done typing about the story, so if you want more, watch the show and you'll quickly pick up what's going on. [Sound] A sound effect for everything, like there should be. The ambient sounds and situational music haven't changed in forever+2. They were good when the series started and that hasn't changed, I only give it a 7 for never ever ever ever changing. [Art] Well they don't change clothes, so they must either not sweat or have really great hygiene. I'm not one to judge art too harshly, but the angles are good and you can usually tell what's going on in a fight. [Character/Hate] Main characters: Naruto - Pretty much described in the [Story] section. Sasuke - Emotional, tormented, get's exponentially stronger every time you see him. Sasuke is Naruto's childhood rival and ""friend"" that Naruto is always trying to save. Sasuke has a horribly tragic beginning in which his whole clan was slain by his brother who then taunts him to grow spiteful and strong to eventually come and get revenge on him. Tobi () - A member of the Akatski with a plan. All I can say when putting the words """" in it. Won't go on about the side characters, except for this following hate part: The characters are great for the most part, except for Sakura... ok, pretty much every female ninja. All the female ninjas in the series are portrayed as weak, emotional, annoying, bothersome, in-the-way, etc.. overall useless individuasl in a male oriented ninja world. Sakura does nothing in fights other than get in the way and attempt to heal people (pretty much always failing) at the end. When she's not failing, she's punching our friendly protagonist in the face and being an all around bitch. Hinata is portrayed as thinking of Naruto all the time, like she has no life apart from her childhood crush, except from when she's being put down at home for being a girl. Ino, short story, she's a bitch that you could never want to relate to. I'd have to say the only women in the whole series that isn't a total failure is Tsunade, because she doesn't take shit from anyone. She still has her occasional emotional breakdown though. [Cons/Hate] First off, I love this series to death. The five minute episodes go by so fast, and I say five minutes because that's about all the time in each episode that isn't dedicated to some flashback of the last episode's flashback. When the plot is actually being advanced, it's exciting and attention holding. Unfortunately the show is also so entangled with filler episodes, which I skip, so much so that it feels like they make an episode once a month! [Overall] Great show, been following it weekly since the original Naruto series first aired. If you are looking for something entertaining, this could very well be it. This show would be great if you just start watching because you can browse through the currently 254 episodes, skipping over countless fillers and flashbacks, and actually enjoy the advancing plot, exciting battles, and interesting twists. Even though I consider Shippuden superior to the original series, I would recommend watching the original first to get some background as to what is going on, or you can actually watch the flashbacks. 10/10 - I hope Naruto Shippuden stays alive.",10,Recommended,"May 11, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_304075c1d8,2,4255

"An incredible work ethic and boundless determination should never be underestimated. At first glance, Naruto Shippuuden, the continuation of Naruto, has a few noticeable differences. Firstly, Shippuuden shows its complexity and serious undertone early on in the series, through the obvious change in Naruto’s personality. And secondly, protagonist is easily defined as Naruto, opposed to our duo of Naruto and Sasuke in the previous season. The story of Shippuuden is driven through the ploy of the Akatsuki, whom are fixated on capturing the jinchuriki and extracting the tailed beasts within. The canonical plot of Shippuuden is definitely attention grabbing, through the use multiple plot twists and numerous life or death situations. The non-canon plot however, is not so great. Overused flashbacks, dwelling on insignificant season one plot, and the apparent need to remind us of events that take place no less than a dozen episodes ago gets tiresome, quickly. It’s truly a shame that the amount of filler in Shippuuden is so high, because the canon portion is outstanding. Once the storyline unfolds after a few episodes the character cast of Shippuuden presents great depth and variety. Each of the reoccurring Hidden Leaf Village shinobi and kunoichi are developed to a great extent, they each have a unique back story and you’re almost certain to find someone you can relate to, if not, become attached to. The ninja of the other main villages and the antagonists all display distinctive features that allow them to be memorable, be it the untouchable Kazekage, Gaara or the cunning missing-nin Orochimaru. The quality of artwork in Shippuuden’s canonical differs greatly from the non-canon. It’s painfully obvious that the filler in Shippuuden is of a lower standard than its counterpart. With that being said, in the main storyline, Studio Pierrot has done a great job. Battle animations are fluid and eye-catching, the scenery is vivid and emotions are portrayed outstandingly. Simply, an outstanding soundtrack, those are the first words that come to mind when I think of Shippuuden. With outstanding openings such as OP3 “Blue Bird” almost welcoming you into an episode with open arms, and endings such as ED12 leaving you begging for more, the soundtrack of Shippuuden is definitely a memorable one. The composer Yasuharu Takanashi incorporates gritty strings, rhythmic percussion, penetrating woodwind instrumentals that captivate the moment, from intense, heart pumping battle music, to calm, vivid emotion evoking melodies, no expense is spared. Overall, Shippuuden is an amazing ride if you can either grind your way through the filler, or skip it entirely. The canonical plot more than makes up for the shortcomings presented though out its counterpart. Comedy is used at appropriate times, the action is engaging and the emotions are high. If I’ve learnt anything from this viewing ,it’s that sticking through the bad times with your head held high whilst never lowering your work ethic will rewarded, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but definitely someday, believe it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 12, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fc82b6db7b,2,3095

It has provided a story that still makes its fans wanting more, it has revived criticism for its filler but when filler is not being aired it is excellent. Story 10/10 Naruto Shippuuden is the sequel of the first series of naruto and continues on from when naruto goes to train with his personal sensei jiriya so he can get stronger to find and rescue his best friend and rival sasuke. But the story of naruto becomes much more than that as the series progresses with so many unexpected twists and turns. If you want a good story i strongly recommend this anime. Art 7/10 Naruto has shown that is has many strong points when it comes to animation but when it comes to consistency of quality in animation it dose not fair to well. The anime has had moments when the quality has strongly declined (Battle of Pain) but most of the time the anime keeps up the quality. Sound 9/10 The sound fx of Naruto Shippuden to the soundtracks and sounds of attacks are nothing short of awesome. The music playing while people are fighting in the anime have an elegant sound to them and gives a nice feeling of relaxation while watching the fight unfold.

There is and gonna be more action in Naruto Shippuuden, I can tell, since I read the manga, some do too. If you are a Naruto fan and just can't wait until the new releases for the episodes, I suggest to read the manga, there are some sites online like; onemanga.com. If you've seen the latest release of Naruto Shippuden, which is episode 27, you should start on Chapter 276. But it would be nice to keep up with the new releases of the episodes and chapters. The new releases of chapters also take 1, sometimes 2, weeks to be release, similar to the episodes' releases, but the manga is way far ahead. The Characters in Naruto are totally awesome and have interesting powers/skills/techniques, well, the characters that are going to appear, later on in Naruto Shippuuden, so the excitement of Shippuuden only just begun, there's much more that's gonna happen, Enjoy!

I clearly remember the first ep of naruto which I ever watched its was a episode from the chunin exam when naruto is writing the test which he doesn't know but the way he handles the situation was pure epic then I watched the first season of the series the zabuza arc and I was star strucked. The strong desire of the main character to be acknowledged by by his village and his friends was something that resonated with my thinking's. Then the series was such a great part of my life that I cannot put it into words When naruto cried I also feel the pain when he work hard he inspired me to do the same and when he achieved some thing it made me so happy that tears started to flow from my eyes There were many moments which I will never forget like say for instance The first time he defeats neji after he wins he takes a victory lap around the arena and everyone in the audience is just shocked to see him win. At that time I was feeling like this is what I want to be. And the infamous scene from after naruto returns the village after defeting pain and the scene in which iruka is telling his story was so heart touching that it made me proud. The story itself was so good that I can overlook many things The back story of naruto was so sad I clearly remember the ep 'thank you' in which he meets with his mother it was just so beautiful At this point you may be thinking that he is just overestimating the series so yes I am. But I too cannot ignore the curse which was making a epic series a avrg one 'filler' it was bullshit pure bulshit, no no it was worse the bullshit Only the novel adaptations were worth mentioning. But living that aside it was a good series and for me a inspirational one So seeing the last episode made me a bit emotional it was 9 years of journey for me and yes I am happy that it ended but I also feel a bit sad So if you have not watched naruto a you feel that you are a failure I think you should give it a try Bcz I know if you can connect with it you will not be disappointed.",10,Recommended,"Mar 23, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d24dafa5d9,3,2345
"I find the series enjoyable and captivating at times although it does occasionally lose track of the main story due to filler episodes and becomes quite dull when it slows down a bit, it will frequently pull you back with spectacular fights and hilarious character situations that will keep you watching. Overall I recommend this anime because it makes you feel almost as though your are standing next to the characters, fighting alongside them and makes you hungry for ramen... You will often find yourself getting attached to characters, whether it's because they are similar to you or you like the depth of their character you will find yourself rooting for them whenever they are in trouble.",8,Recommended,"Apr 27, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_87cdd57408,3,695
"Did you enjoy watching Naruto, or are you still reading Naruto's manga, impatiently waiting for next chapter? Then Naruto Shippuuden is NOT for you. As Naruto was an great anime, it's successor is just one, big soap opera. This &quot;work of art&quot; is overloaded with fillers and many sub-plots. What is more, every one fight or event is extended to the maximum possible amount of time - because of &quot;we-don't-want-to-reach-manga's-plot-so-soon&quot;. Oh, look, it's Kakashi preparing an eye technique! In manga, it was prepared within 2 frames. In anime, it took _whole_5_eps_ to make it prepared (that's 5 weeks of waiting! o_O) If you have plenty (I mean, very, very much) of free time and you're sure NOTHING will bore you, try watching Naruto Shippuuden.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 19, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ceef94df73,3,766
"FAIL That sums up Shippuuden in one word. The animation looks cheap and the facial expressions are not noticeable. Not to mention, the lack of character development is unforgivable, especially in the sub-characters. They show up in the first episode and then disappear. Very good. -__-' Just don't watch it. Watch something interesting like Gintama. At least it retains it's sense of humour, which is sadly lacking in this anime.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 3, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0ac67ea98e,3,429
"How do I even sum up this series? How can I review something so special to me? Still, it must be done, so let me tell you why Naruto is a series you can't leave on your PTW list. Let's start with the basics: sound and art. Naruto (especially Shippuuden) has one of the best soundtracks in anime. Not only with its openings and endings, but its OST songs fit the anime and its tone better than any other anime I've seen. The art is GORGEOUS. Again, especially in Shippuuden because it's more recent compared to the older animation of the original Naruto series. The lighting effects and bright colors make every scene entrancing. I don't know whether to talk about the story or the characters next because both are as high quality as high quality can be, but I'll start with the characters. You can't FIND development like this anywhere else. For one thing, each character is indisputably unique, and it's nice to watch an anime in which you can find a piece of yourself in every character. Also, each of their stories-- heroes and villains alike-- was developed with such care that you can't help but be interested. More than both of those things, though, the sheer power that these characters hold is what really makes them remarkable. Not physical power (though, that type of power gets developed really nicely and realistically throughout the series as well), but mental power. These characters are written with goals and convictions that bring them to life in a way that will capture your heart. You'll become addicted to the characters simply because they give everything all they've got. Now, finally, we come to the story. This is going to be hard to talk about without getting detailed, so I'll keep it as brief as I can by saying this: this story is special. It isn't always unpredictable, and things don't always end happily, but the journey you'll take is-- dare I say-- one of the best you'll ever take. The care that was put into developing this story so that it had the most impact it could have must have been immense. This very well might be the only story I've ever experienced in which I didn't want to skip ahead to see the ending at some point. Every part of the story was important and made me feel so lucky to have found a story like it; I wanted to savor it as long as I could. The story itself is an art piece. A lot of that was my emotions reviewing the anime and not actual critiques, but isn't that more convincing? Naruto has become so special to me, and I'm really, really glad that I got past my assumptions about it beforehand and took the plunge to watch it. I don't think I'll ever find something quite like this again-- and that's why it's so beautiful. Please watch this if you're even a little curious because it'll change your life, I promise you. ありがとう、ナルト.",10,Recommended,"Apr 27, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_46f4ea1169,3,2795

"Naruto Shippuden. One of the most hated series that is super popular. Why is it so hated? No real reason to be honest. Atleast that is what I believe. But don't worry I am not calling anyone who hate it 'morons' or whatever i'm just saying I 'think' it should NOT be as hated as it is. Not even CLOSE. I myself though think that episodes 1-110 aren't THAT good but after that is when it starts to become a 10/10 anime. I will get on to the why. And don't worry I will not make it too long since I think people won't read it all meaning it will all probably go to a big waste of time. I will not give a summary of the series because you can just read it in the main page or pretty much anywhere else. OK now I'll say why I gave it a 10. (Scored FILLER-FREE). Animation (for the most part) gets a 10 and the music gets a 10 too (i also believe EVERYONE should give this a 10 music wise). I believe it has the best music ever along with One Piece CLOSELY beating the music of Pokemon, Bleach and Fairy Tail. The story gets incredible as it progresses and so does the level of enjoyment. Naruto and Sakura become better characters than before but Sasuke declines character wise (that's a given though since he does turn into a heartless villain). All the other characters are as awesome as they were from before (I myself only don't like Ino). The akatsuki are the main villains of the series and in my opinion best villains ever (beating Phantom Troupe and Homunculus by a LITTLE). They have unique special abilities and are VERY fun to watch. And there's Sai, Sasuke's well ... replacement and he is actually not a bad character at all either especially as the story progresses. The action is superb and VERY entertaining and at times you don't know who is going to die (not mentioning names). Sometimes the action is clever too. A lot of strategy is going on in them. So as a result from these things there is too much suspense in it for words. It is unpredictable and VERY suspenseful. They are in such situations at times that you do not know how the problem might get solved. Now I will counter the negative things it might have/people say it has but some reasons might not be good. First problem people say it has- Some parts are RIP-OFF from hxh (both). I have watched hunter x hunter 2011 (my 2nd favourite anime if anyone is wondering where it goes in my personal rank) but I do not at all think this series is a ripoff of Hunter X. The whole eye deal is similar. But it is not a copy.More like inspiration. a copy is doing it exactly like it was but the eye deal in Naruto has a different twist and special things added to it. Like i'm pretty sure Kishimoto (the author of Naruto) knows that something this big will be noticed. Why did he do it? Because he knows it's no big deal or that it shouldn't be. And I haven't heard the author of hunter x complaining to him either so yeah Naruto is not a copy of hxh at all. And to anybody who mentions the hunter exam and Chuunin exam rewatch both they are VERY different. The concept (again) might have been taken but the actual content is EXTREMELY different. Second problem people say it has- FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. Naruto doesn't have too many enjoyable ones but some (Chikara arc for example) are very good (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of Naruto (Shippuden in this case) filler' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. Third problem people say it has- the length. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 4 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). Anyways I know there might be reasons you will disagree with but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this a 10. Action, suspense, great animation, it is almost perfect (for me). Finally, I hope you enjoyed the review (took me quite a lot of time to do it) and that you give it a chance (especially from episode 110). Before that it is enjoyable but I find from episode 110 it's MIND-BLOWING.",10,Recommended,"Mar 19, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e89f098270,3,4223

Though I really like the storyline due to reading the manga I must say i'm really disappointed with Shippuuden. Before this series came out I couldn't wait to see it because of how good the manga is but sadly I realized it's different. Naruto Shippuuden has got to be one of the most boring animes out. If you think you're gonna see an action packed anime think again for the characters stare at each other for 15 minutes before anything happens. By the time the fight starts you're already asleep.

after seeing 109 episodes Story: 7 - Good The storyline is somehow predictable but it never failed to convince me to watch the next episode.. (most of the time) Art: 6 - Fair The art was pretty fair. Not that good because i had seen other anime that has pretty good art than this. Plus point for the Akatsuki Costume. (even though its still simple but cool) Sound: 7 - Good The sound was good but sometimes they put weird background music! I can't just believe they see that as a good for the ears! Mostly the sound was good. Openings and Endings are about 90% good. Character: 8 - Very Good Some have unique characteristics and others are common. Some are annoying and others are likeable. Characters are made in such a way that they represent a unique characteristic. So it is likely you can choose easily your favorite character. Enjoyment: 9 - Great Enjoyed it up to this part. Action ~ Comedy ~ Ninja ~ Overall: 9 - Great OVERALL it is GREAT. I don't hate the fillers. Sometimes its annoying but the filler arcs are not bad at all so still the anime was GREAT. here are my plus and minus factors + (plus) action is very good... mostly this is the viewers are always looking for.. ninja action. kage bunshin no jutsu! awesome techniques! comedy is good too... it made me laugh in some ways... - (minus) too many flashbacks! super slow pace! (it almost took 5 episodes for a fight to finish) new characters are not that unique... they almost look the same from the others! an episode of pure talking! that's is so boring... most common example... jumping on trees then they talk about something for about 15 mins! ( this is too common!) ~ how many times did i see this? hmm... ~ the fillers are not bad but i hate it when they do it in a real slow pace making the filler seemingly unending that viewers are so irritated about it!,9,Recommended,"Oct 20, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f52b5cc9d2,3,1832
"Naruto Shippuden is the continuation of the series Naruto. Well, this is more exciting compared to the first one because it talks about a more mature Naruto. The plot is getting to its climax (according to the Mangaka) and it is really good to the point where it can make you cry. Trust me, you'll cry a lot of times because of this series. The art is good as well as the music. You'll enjoy the fight and every character.

this is a very good series if you were a big fan of the original or before the time skip. The only thing is that it relies heavily on the original series. It is highly recommended that you either read or watch what is before the time skip. Other wise it is amazingly good. There are a lot of improvement from the original anime. I personally think it has a better detail in to what is going on. Another one is the soundtrack. It has a more serious tone to it which add to the intensity of the situation.,10,Recommended,"Jan 1, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fa129b0e43,3,503
"I only read the manga of it. But the anime; I stopped at 263. This anime is the like the COD of anime. Well, you know why. If you are a MAJOR Naruto fan-boy; then do not read this. And please be mature about this. I also want nice comments about this review. And it's a tad bit long. 'Tis appeal. Well: as known as some might say; THE MOST POPULAR ANIME IN THE WORLD.

I used to love this show. But, there is something about this such as on fan-base and applause for this. Many also compare this show to other shows even some from a different genre. Like, some person at my school said that: NARUTO IS THE BETTER THAN FRUITS BASKET BECAUSE NARUTO HAS THE NINE TAIL CHAKRA!''. And many say that this anime can kick any other anime's ass. And I know it's an opinion. But, this starts a bad view of mere. At my school, not a lot of people like anime and some don't even know what it is! Baffling! Pretty much; people at my school only care about sex, dating, and reality shows like ''Jersey Shore'' or ''My Big Redneck Island''. The few that know what anime/manga is only know about Naruto, Bleach, and the BIG 3. They are not real anime fans really. They are just enthusiastic about anime. Let is be specific here: Naruto lacks character development. I don't want to spoil anything; but this has to do with THREE CHARACTERS that appeared in the manga and anime; but introductions for them was bad. And art was fine. Story was dreadful because with poor character development and there is no other form of intro to us when in lookout for other parts. Trying my best not to spoil. Sound and music was good; ARR-DUFF!

"Naruto: Shippuden - what can I say? I used to love this shit. Back in 2007 I would wait for the episodes, coming back from school every Friday to excitedly check whether or not the latest episode had been uploaded and subbed. Unfortunately I no longer find the series nearly as enjoyable as before. STORY I know this might anger all you angry Naruto fanboys out there, but come on guys, where is the story in Naruto: Shippuden? All it's about is our title character, Naruto, trying to bring Sasuke back from the dark side. I admit that Kishimoto isn't as bad as Kubo in this department (who seems to be making the shit up as he goes along; either that or he likes trolling us (eg: ""Who said the Espada numbers go from 1-10?!?!"" *trollface*) but of course that is an entirely different matter. All I can say is that at least Kishimoto seems to plan a few weeks in advance). I wonder if people ever get bored of Naruto chasing after Sasuke. ""But no, psyxwar, Naruto isn't just about him chasing after Sasuke!"" I hear you say. Maybe you have a point. It seems that the series is now about the Akatsuki, a criminal organisation, chasing after ""tailed beasts"", beasts of ""chakra"" (that's Naruto terminology for energy, ki, etc) with tails and their plan of world domination. I agree. There seems to be a little variation in events. This is why I have given Naruto: Shippuden a very generous score of ""2"" for Story. Of course, you, being the passionate, die-hard Naruto fanboy that you are, probably do not accept my reasoning and justification for giving Naruto: Shippuden a ""2"" in the Story department. Fair enough. But shouldn't you put this into perspective? Would you read a book that had a guy chasing another guy as its plot? I know I wouldn't. tl;dr: Naruto: Shippuden is about a guy chasing another guy ART The art of the anime is okay - nothing exceptional, but pretty good nonetheless. There are countless examples of newer animes with better art and more fluid animation, but I won't hold this against Naruto: Shippuden. I've seen far worse in my years as an otaku. SOUND The sound is good as well, but again, nothing exceptional. I would usually skip over the same opening after watching it one or two times which usually just means it's ""meh"". There was nothing godly like ""Hare Hare Yukai"" (where I would watch that every. single. time.) CHARACTER The character development and characters in general admittedly weren't that bad. Naruto definitely develops in skill (and maturity?) a fair bit over the course of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything so I won't really elaborate further on the issue of character development. I'd like to add that despite somewhat ""maturing"", this may simply be superficial as he still chases after Sasuke. He should know by now that he's a goddamn sociopath and wants to kill everyone and destroy his village. The characters are for most part unique with their own personalities. ENJOYMENT Did I enjoy it? Meh, it was alright. Nothing exceptional. I feel as if I've wasted hours upon hours watching this shit though. I feel that if I wasn't such a dedicated fanboy in my youth, I would have enjoyed this series a lot less.

"Okay so after seeing so many bashings of the anime i've finally had enough and decided to write my own review. STORY:10/10 Okay so the story is the same as the original Naruto series or rather almost the same , because as the characters develop and change so does the plot. And even though everyone complains about how the whole ""Save-my-best-friend-from-the-evil"" is really cliche i have to disagree. The story is so much more than saving Sasuke if you have failed to see that then it's understandible why you don't like the anime. Every character in the anime and their own story can be made into different animes that's how interesting some of their past and future acts are.There are alot of plot twists and i don't know about you guys but i find the idea to split Naruto into two part , Naruto and Shippuuden as in young and older, is really great. Even though we have this gap of 2.5 years of training ,as the anime progresses further we ,step by step, begin to uderstand just how much the charcaters and their atitutes have changed. ART:9.7/10 I don't know about ypu but i personally love the art , true at some point it does get lower in quality but i still like it. The fight scence are done really well ,you know the more inportant fights.Lately as the Kage Summit arc has started the animation is really smooth and good, too. SOUND:10/10 The openings and endings are great i don't know just how many of them i have downloaded and i listen to them ,like, everyday.The backround music is fitting too and the voice actors are doing an amazing job so far, too .I can't even imagine what it would be if the VAs change . CHARACTERS:10/10 Okay this is one of Shippuuden;s strong points, if not the strongest. Every character,almost, has development and if you actually look into them you'll see that Naruto, the main hero, has one of the littlest developments. We see that Sakura is stronger and she doesn't cry that much she is more independent and she has some feelings for Naruto as well , to what extent is unknown yet. Shikamaru's stories is also one of the best and we get to see just how responsible and genious he is. Sasuke is well.........Sasuke but he has changed alot too [ and i actually started to like him ] His and Itachi's stories is amazing you have to see thaat it's really complicaded and yet sp meaningfull and tragicly beautiful. Gaara has really been opening up to people , he smiles sometimes and he is friendlier and he puts alot of effort to change and act like a normal person.So as you can see most of the characters's backrounds are revealed even the Akatsuki members's and it's done in a really good way. ENJOYMENT:10/10 Naruto/Shippuuden is one of the best animes I have evr seen , even though i used to not like it so much at one point . The fillers i have nothing to say about, every long anime has fillers so that it won't chatch up to the manga that way there won't be anything to animate. OVERALL 10/10 I love this show mainly 'cuz at first it seems so childish and so smiple but it's actually alot more complicated and wonderful but i guess it's not really for everyone.

"Because of the obvious deviation and independence from the main series of Shippuuden filler material, I am not regarding it as part of the series. Shippuuden picks up where Naruto left, only to shine on with the same brilliancy that made Naruto famous. A new, even more intense presentation form, with epic soundtracks, great animation, and the most badass characters ever. The plot does not stagnate, it continues to grow in complexity, going to even more staggering depths as one learns about the great conspiracies and injustices of the ninja world. Do expect big surprises and plot twists. Also expect no less than the elite of the elite ninjas - to help situate their power, some of them should defeat with ease even Jiraiya, the lengendary Konoha ninja. It is true that the first arc takes a while to develop and spends much time building tension, but if you watch the episodes in a row, it will be just as enjoyable in its new way. The pace is not artificially slow, just fittingly slow. While Naruto was awesome, this is now an epic series.

"Before I even start the review, I would like to mention this is based off of the anime only. Story 6/10 I have to admit Shippuden starts off weak, but gets better once you reach the Hidan and Kakazu Arc which is the 5th anime arc. Then it keeps getting better until the Shinobi War Arc where both the manga and anime go way downhill. I always found Naruto had the best pacing and the most consistent story out of the big three. Even though many fillers, it wasn't until the War Arc where it started to directly affect the canon material and this was due to canon episodes and filler episodes being mixed together in one arc. Art 1/10 At first I defended Shippuden's animation because it was just new, not worse. And it was like that for a long time. Then came the famous fight between Naruto and the final Pein where the animation was just horrendous. Then it got a bit better, but when the 5 Kage Summit Arc started, animation began to go downhill. The point where I stopped defending the animation was the double episode 220 & 221. This double episode was the most inconsistent animated episode I have ever seen. Even if you are an anime only watcher, you could tell canon from filler just based on how the scene was animated. I am serious on this. But that wasn't even the worst yet! And the next example I am going to use may not be either since at this point it is only at episode 321, and unfortunately the animation may get even worse. Anyways the worst animated was episode 298. This was the first episode of a 2 episode fight; the fight Naruto and Killer B vs Itachi and Nagato. Don't get me wrong episode 2 was also bad but this was worse. Not only did the characters look like rag dolls swinging around when they fought, but Itachi didn't even look like Itachi. At least in episode 2 he looked like himself. And BTW these were canon episodes. Sound 9/10 I've always like the openings and endings better in Shippuden than in Part One. I guess they are more of my type of music. As for the soundtrack, it was different than Part One, but I enjoyed it just as much. I have always found that the OST's in both Part 1 and 2, were matched perfectly with the scene and the music is just really overly well done. Characters 5/10 Why I am giving this such a low score is because all attention is focused on either Naruto or Sasuke and every other character that showed promise in part one, seemed to be instantly dropped from the canon material. At least the fillers gave them a bit of spotlight, but in my opinion it was by no means enough. Enjoyment 6/10 Why I am giving this such a low score is because of all the filler that interrupts the series. Now that wouldn't be necessarily a bad thing if the filler was good, but its just really bad; except for the Konoha History Arc which was done well. Overall 5/10 Face it, Shippuden just isn't as good as part 1. Maybe if Masashi Kishimoto would have focused on making more characters a part of part two and he paid even a little attention to what goes on in the anime, it might have been decent.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 11, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_98f72f01e1,3,3048
"Here I am, typing out my second review of Naruto. Apparently I feel pretty strongly about this series, and not in a good way either. But first, let me tell you why I even bothered with this series. If you were in middle-high school in the mid to late 2000s, then chances are you were exposed to the full brunt of the Naruto craze. I was in 5th or 6th grade at the time and all I was ever exposed to were AMVs. It wasn't until a few years later that I decided to take it upon myself to watch the series to the bitter end. And what a wonderful mistake that was. Alright, with all the personal bullshit out of the way, let's get to business. Since I'm lazy, I'll just write a review for the original series by extension as well. Story: 3/10 About as predictable as you can imagine. Some bratty kid has an overly ambitious goal and the story revolves around him trying to reach it. And of course, he does, and some people might argue that the suspense lies in how it all happened. In other words, when there's already a foregone conclusion, all the stuff in the middle is supposed to be exciting. While the story is not necessarily ""unexciting"", it IS drawn out, bland, and riddled with plot holes. Villains are constantly revealed to be mere puppets for an increasingly more powerful villain, and all Naruto has to do to convince them to his way of thinking is talk to them. Rinse and repeat like four or five times. The story also contains way more characters than it can handle, as key characters from early on in the series, like Orochimaru, are simply forgotten in favor of other plot developments. The bigger fights can easily span over 5 episodes, leading to the action being just as slow as the plot progression. Ultimately, the story seems to take its focus off of Naruto and his journey to reach his goal and devolve into a somehow even less interesting Uchiha clan soap opera. Art: 4/10 The art is nothing spectacular but also not totally hideous to look at. The REAL flaw lies in its animation, which fluctuates in quality and shows a lack of care on the animators' part. Everyone knows the notorious Naruto vs Pain fight, one of the most major fights in the series. In an attempt to make the animation look more fluid and polished, the character's faces and bodies are stretched and skewed and basically everything goes to hell. Plus, there's the animators' crippling inability to draw faces or objects that are far away. Some of the filler characters are either intentionally ugly or just lazily drawn, but we're not touching those. Sound: 7/10 The soundtrack is admittedly pretty impressive. I mean, it's normal to get sick of the opening after the tenth or so time, but some of them really shine. The music is a mix of traditional Japanese instruments and punk rock, and somehow they just mesh so well together. However, I can't particularly choose a favorite track. There are very few that really stand out, but all of them are great. However, I think I have a clear bias towards Shippuden's soundtrack, because it feels grander and more emotional. Character: 2/10 (this is gonna be a long one) For me, THIS is where the series truly fails. As I said before, Naruto has way more characters than its story can handle. Stories with large casts that all have good development is possible, but this is not the case for Naruto. The first problem is that the main characters are significantly less interesting than the side characters could be. Naruto is designed to be a goofy yet charismatic guy who just draws people to him without explanation, but instead comes off as annoying and preachy. He inexplicably converts the worst of villains to his way of thinking, and it comes off as just plain stupid. It's possible to have one character be a moral compass and not have everyone worship them. Then there's Sasuke, who's designed to be a polar opposite to Naruto, but instead comes off as an edgelord. Rounding off the main cast is Sakura, who is supposed to be a strong heroine type but instead comes off a doormat who lets Sasuke toy with her emotions and relies on Naruto to do shit for her. The main cast is simply bland, but it's the villains I was most disappointed with because of how they were handled. After shaping them up to be generic bad guys without feeling or remorse, Kishimoto likes to trick you into feeling bad for them by slapping on a tragic backstory, usually shortly before or even after their death. Their backstories almost always involve the death of a loved one driving them to their current state. This is part of Naruto's message about forgiveness, but it still doesn't work as a narrative device. To make a villain sympathetic, you have to humanize them while they're still alive. The other reason Kishimoto fails at writing tragic villains is because their true motives are usually only presented to the audience as opposed to the characters in the story, and so the good guy never questions what they're doing (not that this would have worked anyway). In short, Kishimoto shouldn't have even bothered trying to make most of the villains sympathetic. Enjoyment: 4/10 As you can tell, I got bored with this series after all was said and done. Almost the entire cast was underdeveloped, and while the side characters had the most potential, they slowly but inevitably became part of the Naruto circlejerk that encompassed the entire ninja world. The animation tends to fluctuate depending on the animator's budget, and the story is exactly what you would expect from the Big Three: bland, incomplete, and way longer than it needs to be. I should mention that one of Naruto's messages is that previous generations should carve the path for the next generation to take their place. Now that its glory days have long since past, I think Naruto should do the same.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 12, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_139897a6c8,3,5798
"Story: Its the continuation of Naruto so its got alot of back story and character history, right now there is alot of people who dont like how this series is turning out and is not much to compaire to early naruto. But if you love the series and want more after the end of the first chapter of naruto then this is what you have been waiting for. Animation: Characters have changed a bit, nothing much besides that, same style. Sound: Same as naruto. nothing note worthy Character: Everyone is back and they added someone new people to and it will just get better. However naruto is still pretty lame so it isn\'t perfect. Enjoyment: You get to see what happens after naruto, thumbs up to that. overall: Meh, IMO it should have been done like the manga and they shouldnt have changed the name of the show but hey atleast they havent had a single filler because of the giant span in story between the manga and anime.

"I have to say, shippuuden's a great show, but naruto could've started shippuuden a little after the sasuke retrival arc, and skip all of the ridiculous fillers! But thats not the point, the point is that shippuuden's a great anime pick if you want your fill of great naruto action and comedy!(filler free, mind you) The show's pretty good itself, but one of the flaws that most animes have is theres TOO much talking and flashbacks during fights! I mean, when some ninjas bust in to an evil ninja groups lair, you dont have conversations with them!!!!! But overall, the shows great! Also, it has one of the best theme songs EVER!!!! If you've finished the entire naruto series, then shippuuden's a great choice for you!",8,Recommended,"Aug 16, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f5cd6aba73,4,719
"I really love this series. Since the first inception of Naruto in 2007 up until now, I have not been disappointed. Naruto, a seemingly trite and boistrous young man who wants to become the next Hokage in the hidden leaf is now fighting to keep his friends and family from harm from the most volatile enemy he can ever face, which is Sasuke Uchiha. A long time classmate until Sasuke's sudden disappearance to join a hidden group of cut throat killers. Naruto now finds himself closer to his nine tailed demon as a partner rather than foe because of his mothers implanted consciousness. With the help of her, Naruto nears his goal of attaining the most powerful demon as his own weapon. But he still has a few fights left to overcome the obstacle. However in the middle, are his new friends from the hidden cloud clan. Bee, a man of weird intelligence which he likes to mix with rap in a conversation, helps Naruto beat his Nine tailed fox to such a degree, that the fox has no choice now but to listen. Yet their foe the Akatsuki, still need to acquire the nine tail fox in order to bring back the original demon - The ten tailed fox. All that is left is Naruto's and Bee's demons to make it happen. In the middle is Sasuke who wants nothing more than to destroy the hidden leaf, and with the akatsuki's help, his dream might be realized. Although now, with naruto's new powers of his sage mode and nine tail, sasuke will have even more of a challenge using his own dark evil demon. I think this series is great, to see naruto grow up from series episode to the next until his teen years, to now where he is virtually a full grown man, is enlightening. I have to say that for all the anime's I've watched, the story just keeps getting better and better. I can't wait until the huge final showdown between Sasuke and Naruto. But for now, I want to watch the Naruto Blood Prison movie coming soon. That should be quite the story.",10,Recommended,"Feb 23, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d6769e37a8,4,1927
"This thing which many of you call anime used to be cool at some point until the producers decided to just destroy with loads of fillers. Of course, it was never a top anime. The twists and the storytelling is fine but I don't understand why is everything so Cliche in it. I mean, one character dies on the battlefield and everyone just stand still and stop fighting and look at that dying character. Also the dialogues appear to be the work of 9 year old writers. The art is fine but it got very bad in some critical points like the Pain arc. (I'm pretty sure everyone remembers the crappy animation and style during Naruto's fight with pain) The character development is fine also but they ruin it by giving them too many crappy dialogues. Overall it is good at some certain points but the story started to get worse and worse with time until recently when the story was just totally destroyed.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 3, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fda565c4a0,4,895
"Naruto makes up one of the Big 3. This review shall be for the entirety of Naruto and Naruto Shippuuden and shall contain my opinion of Naruto while trying to be as unbiased as possible. Before anyone asks, yes I have read Naruto entirely, and it was one of my first mangas/anime and I was somebody who thought Naruto was a perfect anime before realizing its fair share of flaws and before watching/reading other animes/mangas. Progression (6): Naruto is a manga with 700 chapters... 700 CHAPTERS, it is definitely long and of course has some useless arcs which make you wonder what the point of that arc was. There are also useless conversations that feel repeated between two characters in the show, and there are the past of characters remembered that are often repetitive. However, the fight sequences are done absolutely spectacularly. The hype level while major fights occur are often unreal and are often deserved because the fight scenes are quite good. Story (4): The story of Naruto is somewhat mediocre to be very brutally honest. It is riddled with Deus Ex Machina writing, so much so that the fans have dubbed the very often Deus Ex Machina writing with a term called ""Plot no Jutsu."" There are also some plot holes within the show, but I do not find too much fault with the plot holes as any show this long shall probably have at least one plot hole. The themes of Naruto would be good if they were not told from a black and white morality viewpoint in which the victor of the battle was always correct. Also the themes are not depicted very well (as with the case of Neji believing that heritage meant everything, and oddly enough turning out to be correct in the end as we find out who Naruto's father is, even though he concludes that heritage does not matter.) The biggest theme in this show seems to be about friendship, and although it's interesting the first and second time they talk about it, it becomes too repetitive whenever all Naruto says is his answers are his friends. Humor also loses its effect in the story when it's done in the middle of the story which breaks immersion. I wouldn't mind it if it was a slight chuckle, but the fact that they are trying to make you laugh uncontrollably drives you away from the story. Art (8): The art is not anything to write home about in Naruto, however the fight scenes are done very well. Very little times have I seen fight scenes in other anime and manga be able to compare to Naruto. Sound (10): The music in Naruto goes very well at times with what is going on in Naruto. In fact some soundtracks are good enough to be listened to without any accompaniment of the episode, such as ""Sadness and Sorrow."" Characters (1): My reviews are always honest, and being honest, I must be brutally honest that the characters in Naruto were AWFUL. The reason why I say this is that although there are interesting characters in the show, they become quite insignificant. My point is this, there are maybe 10 characters that matter in the entirety of Naruto, and everyone else could have never existed and the plot would have been relatively the same. Fan favorite characters such as Rock Lee or Neji become insignificant enough that towards the end of the manga, my brother (who also reads this with me) asked me who Rock Lee and Neji were. The characters that do matter are often cliche and even boring. There is the main character who falls very easily into the shonen mainstream hero archetype, there is the angry child archetype, the girl who has a crush archetype, and the wise teacher archetype. Enjoyment (5): Although the story was not very great and the characters were terrible, at the end of the day the product was still somewhat enjoyable. The main reason why was because of the fight scenes and the fact that you get to see MAGICAL NINJAS FIGHTING. If that isn't an awesome setup for spectacular fight scenes, then I do not know what is. However, the really boring and generic story, the boring characters, and the nothing that often happened in an arc puts this score down quite a bit. TLDR? Pros: *The fight sequences are spectacular *Good soundtrack with the fight scenes *Chuunin Exam arc has remained up to date one of the best shounen arcs I have seen *The humor can be funny as a pick-me-up. Cons: *Terrible Story - Much deus ex machina (plot no jutsu) writing, or writing that feels as though it were made up in the last moment, and there are few plot holes. The plot holes are faulted slightly less by the fact that any story this long will probably have at least one plot hole. *The length of the story is far too long. It loses much charm and interest after such long periods of time. After a while you lose immersion. *Much filler (doesn't really apply to the manga or to those who skip filler so it does not have much minus on the review) *Very cliche characters, and the minor characters who were fan favorites become completely irrelevant to the point where they could be nonexistent and nothing would change. *Themes are not depicted well, especially with the black-white morality. It feels as though whoever wins the battle has the correct viewpoint which is narrow-minded. *Plot often feels repetitive, just about everyone has lost somebody close to them in the past and have decided to become the villain because of that. *The pacing is inconsistent. At times you'll be going down a rollercoaster ride having a character learn much at one time, other times Naruto will be yelling Sasuke's name and looking for him in a fruitless attempt to reconcile. *The humor can also get in the way of the story. At times, the tone will be feeling more serious, but when comic relief (beyond a chuckle) happens the atmosphere is broken, immersion is lost, and you lost the chance of taking that scene very seriously. Overall Score: 5.5/10 (Just round it up to 6/10) ***Please keep in mind that this is just a review and a personal opinion. I am just being entirely honest here about what I thought was good and what I thought was bad. This is not a hate review or a love review, and I try my best to be unbiased and write what I truly thought about the show/manga after watching/reading it.

"Covering the 2nd half of Naruto manga, Shippuden adapts the teenaged years of the titular character. I wanna start this review by admitting that I am quite thankful there were people who managed to really enjoy the full road Shippuden brings. It's a long one, 500 episodes counting filler and around 300 even if you aren't. It took me 5 months to get through all the material skipping everything filler related. Now, it's actually been quite a while since I finished Shippuden (finished it last November) but I feel with a clearer head now's a better time than ever to go over everything with the series. I enjoyed very little of Naruto Shippuden. To start with, Naruto is... Well, not a very fun protagonist to say the least. He starts off the series seeming at least a little more mature and less annoying than his original counterpart but as the series goes on his character takes a complete nosedive and it was hard for me to really enjoy him as a character by the end. His obsession with getting Sasuke back (who at the end of Naruto abandoned the Hidden Leaf to join that series' big bad in a move that would've potentially ended with his death), while understandable, feels completely unbelievable and unjustified. I feel this could've been corrected by exploring both characters similarities (which happens... 470 episodes in...) But for the majority of the series the goal of bringing back Sasuke feels so hard to care about. Another one of the main characters I enjoyed very little of was Sakura. Sakura is actually just not good. Her character in the previous series, while annoying and mostly unlikable, made sense. She was the most realistic of the cast, reacting to events how an actual 12 year old girl would in the events. Her treatment of Naruto and obsession over Sasuke back then felt understandable and it led me not to really dislike her much. Enter Shippuden Sakura. She starts off fairly well with some new abilities (becoming stronger plus learning to heal from Tsunade). However this only lasts for one story arc as by the second story arc she's reverted back to her old ways fairly quickly, rarely amounting to much in the story. She gets one cool moment towards the end of the Ninja World War when Team 7 reunities but not only is the scene poorly built up, aside from landing a good blow to the final villain she doesn't do too much. As a character her interactions with Naruto are dreadful. Really amounting to nothing more than Sakura deriding Naruto for being stupid, praising him for managing to do things despite that or maybe sometimes a little bit of hero worship. However she hits her absolute lowest as a character anytime something involves Sasuke. Her little childhood crush never goes away and while it doesn't seem to bad, the 5 Kage Summit arc is just... Well lemme explain. Once Sasuke is officially labeled a rouge ninja which means he must be eradicated, the majority of the original Genin kids (Sans Naruto and of course Sasuke) decide that'll it'll be up to them to take care of Sasuke. Sakura however decides to fight him on her own. I didn't mind this because it shows a small semblance of character development. However she struggles to do so due to still being in love with him and honestly she is unable to hold a candle to a weaker Sasuke (having just killed a man after all). I find it very disappointing and really dumb of Sakura. Otherwise, the cast of characters in this series is VERY expansive but good luck seeing them on screen at all. Older characters that could use development or could be used in new arcs end up getting replaced with new characters who serve on simple purpose and then usually get put on a bus and forgotten anyways. Heya Sai, Taka members. The one exception to this is Shikamaru, the only member of the original Konoha 12 that isn't Naruto or Sasuke who continues to develop. He actually gets his own story arc, the first story arc in the anime to actually be above ""meh"" level. In fact, I'd say it's pretty damn good. Otherwise, the cast of characters is mostly dreadful in this arc. However I will admit: even many months later Shippuden has some great villains. Wasn't big on Orochimaru in the original series, so the amount of good villains actually surprised me. Whether they be mini-bosses like Hidan, Kakazu, that one guy who flies on a clay bird and uses explosives (forgot his name my bad) or Itachi. The bigger bads are definitely some of the best though. Pain and Obito are still my two favorite anime antagonists. Kinda surprising considering my thoughts on the rest of the series so far... Though to be honest I still don't like Madara. He's not really bad, just very basic imo. That being said, what about the story. *Large exhale* The story isn't bad when it starts off if I'm gonna be honest, but they aren't really all that great either. I felt very little reason to care about the story, a thing which I blame on it's characters. It's not until a major character dies around 70 episodes in where I actually found myself getting invested in the series. Episode 81 (The Episode titled ""Team 10"" is one of the most well directed anime episodes I believe. From there on the series begins to start getting back to original Naruto levels of decent. Sasuke's fight with Itachi, the reveal of Pain, many major plot events all culminating in ""The Pain Invasion"" as Naruto becomes the last objective of the Akatsuki's hit list. While overall the arc tends to become quite frustrating (One notable thing being that Naruto isn't around for most of the invasion, training in another dimension, which is something that could actually work in the other characters advantage as Naruto's capture would mean the end of the world. However Tsunade objects, wanting Naruto to be apart of the fight which is a bad idea in every way knowing how more experienced fighters lost to Pain and Naruto is a 16 year old). However the fight between Naruto and Pain makes up for it. A battle between two different ideas of peace with some amazing animation and Naruto's subsequent breakdown towards the end I'd quite heartbreaking. However, at the very end Naruto simply talks Pain out of his evil ways turning him good. While this is a fairly common Naruto story element and on that I defend in fact, it was poorly implimented and was the beginning of the final downfall of Shippuden. I could go on about the Fourth Great Ninja War arc but it's fairly lengthy (About 2/3's of the whole anime) and so a rant would probably be quite long. Overall the plot sets itself up as interesting but nothing interesting actually happens. I found more often the not I'd either be anticipating a singular event that was to take place in the story, or just straight up anticipating the arcs ending. Can I also talk about the series' animation? The art design becomes a lot softer and more exaggerated as the series continues, which I appreciate. However for the most part the characters look and move stiffly no matter where the series is. Every now and then the series gets its best animators on a single episode (mostly fights with spectacular results see Sakura vs Sasori, Sasuke vs Deidara and Naruto vs Sasuke) but this is only 5% of a 500 episode anime. The show looks DREADFUL through and throughout I can say though: Its soundtrack is phenomenal. Probably my favorite or second favorite soundtrack. It's a little weak at the start but by the end of the ninja world war it really hits its peak. Honestly what can I say about Shippuden. It really hurt to get through and unless there's some sort of Shippuden Kai, I'm never watching this series again. Oh, but one thing before I finish this review. Don't forget how the series tore down it's whole heartwarming idea that hard work will pay off. Naruto, who was always played up as the underdog who came from nothing, turned out to be not only the chosen one, but was also related the VARIOUS strong individuals from the past (1st Hokages wife is his ancestor. Son of the 4th Hokage. Reincarnation of ninja Jesus etc). *Sigh* Why Kishimoto... Why...",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 25, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_b26b5b9b92,4,8058
"So it goes like this - Akatsuki a criminal organization of rogue ninjas is on the move to capture all the jinchurikis. Naruto is on the move to bring Sasuke back. Sasuke is on the move to kill his brother Itachi who is an Akatsuki member. Other characters are inconsequential in the eyes of the writer. There are a whole lot of problems with this series but the main problem is Naruto himself. Why would he go so far to bring back a dick like Sasuke who does not give a shit about him or any other person. Naruto completely sidesteps his ambition to become a hokage. His new goal is to bring back Sasuke. Why the hell is Sasuke so important? For this series to work Sasuke should have been a real great guy who was loved by and who was a real hero but Sasuke is a self centered dick,piece of shit,asshole. The only persons who care about Sasuke are Naruto and Sakura and it is an established fact that both of them are retarded. So the main problem with me is the motivation of the hero which is completely illogical. The second problem is the hero itself. Naruto is a weak person. He has had his balls removed. He is a self pitying piece of shit who cries on a drop of a hat , who treats important people like shit and sucks up to Sasuke. It would have been great if the hero had been a guy like Edward Elric because Ed also has a tendency to get emotional and well up but no one can call him a sissy pants. However the most excruciating aspect of the series is its pacing. It just goes on and on and on. It eats up a whole episode to do something which requires merely 5 - 6 mins. There are flashbacks to remind you about what happened five minutes ago and this also happens during action sequences which kills the momentum and intensity which is already lacking. Finally I am so angry because I think this series had so much more potential. It throws you into a complex and interesting world of ninjas but focuses on the faggots - narusasu. It gives us awesome characters like Kakashi and Ero Sennin and sidesteps them completely. They should have been the heroes.

"I was all into this show back when I was was in middle school. At some point later, this show was moving too slow for me so i started going with it through the manga releases. Eventually I ran out of time and lost rhythm with the anime. I ended up finishing the manga version though. I already know what happens story wise. This manga is too slow paced and long winded. They could of made this show happen in 250 episodes combined. Both naruto and shippuuden. Instead it became a cash cow and quality suffered. It could be I fell out of love with this show because perhaps my tastes changed as I got older. It was one of my favorite shows when I first started watching it. Then when at some point during high school it just didn't attract me, it ended up feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyment. Story wise it started out good, then became way too repetitive and predictable. They drag things out for no reason. Its not like this show will make you think on a deeper level.

Think About it We're currently 90 Chapters Behind them, And i'd say about 3-4 chapters are in each episode. That leaves around 30 or Less Weeks. at the same time, If We're going at 3 chapters a week, and they're going at 1 chapter a week, without fillers or DELAYS, We would catch up in almost no time at all!

"Naruto Shippuden is the long awaited sequel of Naruto. Naruto is a good anime that's why it's no wonder why it became so popular,however Naruto Shippuden ruined it. Story: 4/10 Naruto Shippuden started off really good, at least it didn't failed everyone's expectation after the long wait. It was nice to see Naruto and the rest grew up as teenagers -with their new missions and new journey. However... as the series continue, the story started to get messed up and slowly went downhill. The story started to focus more on Naruto and Sasuke's relationship - on how Naruto wanted to keep his promise to Sakura and bring Sasuke back. The fights took so long, not because a fierce fight was going on but because of the long talks during the fight. Art: 2/10 The characters doesn't look as good as before. The animation is also really bad, it looks so dull. There were fight scenes that could've been great to watch, but because of bad animation, it became boring to watch. There are also times when the characters look distorted -especially during fight scenes. Character: 6/10 Nothing much has change from the characters...except: Some old characters that we thought of as cool ended up doing nothing really helpful and ended up like side characters. There are new interesting characters but the attention for them slowly fade. The are lots of characters that wasn't given the attention and development that they deserve.

"This is one of those childhood anime that is full of memories, but after I watched it thoroughly, I decided not to recommend this anime. The reason is simple, there are too many flashbacks in each episode, this is the worst motive for stalling time in my opinion. there are a lot of useless episodes but most of them are filled with flashbacks which are very long, long, very long and even take up several episodes. I don't have a problem with flashbacks from each character, but the problem is the positioning, for example, I was enjoying watching Naruto fight but suddenly I met another character and the flashback started, seriously? The worst thing was the flashback of Sakura saying to bring Sasuke back, I was really tired of hearing that, I don't know how many times I had to hear Sakura's cries for help! So in conclusion, this anime is good, but there are many negative points, especially for flashbacks, imperfect placement, as long as you put flashbacks anywhere, In other words, this anime is too fixated on flashbacks, really badly, and what's worse is that the same flashback is played again in other episodes, only with a few scenes added, and this applies to other flashbacks.

"Inconsistent the whole way, even when it comes to its strengths. - Naruto is sometimes his entertaining and cheeky self from before the timeskip, other times he's just a goody two shoes protagonist. - Sometimes the dialogue is very solid, but other times it falls off the deep end (sometimes even in the same conversation). - The animation can be anything from appalling to passable, occasionally being amazing. - Some story arcs are really engaging and fun, others feel like filler. - Sometimes, the filler episodes feel canon (Itachi's backstory) while some canon episodes feel like filler (anything involving Sai). - The story felt consistent and cohesive the entire way, except at the very end where they create plot holes out of thin air for absolutely no reason. - The show explores a lot of interesting themes, but some of them get completely butchered (such as hard work vs talent) - The climax is butchered only to be saved and then butchered again immediately. - Sometimes the show nails something you would never imagine, but then completely flop on very obvious things. The one thing I can grant Naruto Shippuuden is that it has the best villains I have seen in any series. There's such a wide variety of villains and they are all interesting in their own specific way. Every villain seems to have their own motives, and the best thing is that all the motives are believable. Skip the filler, but also understand that a lot of the time will be miserable, but there will be some very strong arcs and moments. If you prefer a consistent, entertaining experience, this may not be it. However, if you think strong moments are worth waddling through the mud, you might like it.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 4, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_420f5d23eb,4,1684

"Naruto Shippuuden, the sequel to Naruto, finally resumes the main story after endless amounts of filler. Some people say that this is the worst anime ever while there are also some other people who say that this is the best anime ever. After catching up to the latest episode, I can safely say that this is not the best anime and it is also not the worst anime ever. Story : 7/10 Now before you start watching this show make sure that you must watch the prequel as you will not understand a single thing without watching the prequel. The show begins with Naruto returning to his village , Konohagakure after 3 years of training with the legendary sannin Jiraiya. He looks stronger , taller and more muscular however he has not learn any new jutsu at all even after training for THREE YEARS. The organization , Akatsuki has also began to take action as they are starting to take action as they are slowly kidnapping the Jinchurikis for their plan. A new dark threat lies ahead and also Orochimaru is also planning to make Sasuke his new vessel and Naruto must save him from it before it happens. Now the story is pretty standard and good however the only thing that makes me frustrated is that there are always fillers that makes you think what the hell is this? What is the point of showing this? If only there are no fillers and freaking 10 minute flashbacks that always happen frequently this show would have been definitely less than 400 episodes.However, if you remove all the fillers and flashbacks, you will have a fantastic story which is filled with great action and some of the saddest scenes I have ever seen. Unfortunately the story is overshadowed by huge amount of fillers that is just plain annoying. Don't get me wrong, there were some fillers that were just plain awesome such as the Kakashi anbu arc which is a must watch. Art : 7/10 The art of Naruto Shippuuden is definitely a lot better than its prequel. There were some ups and downs which there were some episodes which the art just looked plain weird but there were some episodes in which the art looked fantastic (Episode 322). Overall the art is average and there is really nothing much to complain or admire about. Sound : 7/10 The soundtrack for Naruto Shippuuden is pretty fantastic. There were some ost that I listen to frequently (Pain's theme). The openings and endings are pretty average as there were some which is so awesome (opening 6 and 16) and there were some that were just plain awful. Overall the soundtrack is pretty decent as there were nothing to complain about. Character : 9/10 The characters are the keypoint and the best part of the show. Each and every character always has enough depth and background which shows you why are they doing this. Naruto Uzumaki has really received so much character development and has grown from a young kid who loves to pull pranks to a strong and dependable adult. The supporting characters are all fantastic and amazing especially Uchiha Itachi and the Fourth Hokage who are both just plain awesome. My only complain about the characters is Sakura Haruno who at first looks like she has become stronger and more independent but as the story progressed, you can see that the author just doesn't give a crap about her and makes her do all the annoying things. Hell the only thing she did was yell either Naruto or Sasuke's name. The fillers character were also just annoying. For example there was this kid who keeps talking about his home which annoyed me to no end. Despite me complaining so much about the characters the characters were really great and it was really entertaining to watch them do the things they do. Enjoyment : 6/10 To be honest I really enjoyed watching Naruto Shippuuden main story but when it comes to the fillers all my excitement goes down the drain and I just multitask while watching it. For example the current episode is also a filler which seriously pissed me off as they just showed an incredible twist then boom they suddenly show a flashback about a story which I don't give a damn about. Well the show is really enjoyable when it comes to the main plot. Overall : 7/10 Overall Naruto Shippuuden has its ups and downs. Hell I cried like a baby so many times at some scenes which were incredibly sad. I also had goosebumps at some scenes which were just plain awesome. Naruto Shippuden is definitely a lot more mature and better than it's prequel and best part of all is that people actually die in this anime. Such a pity that the large amount of fillers and flashbacks really drags this show down as if they remove the flashbacks and fillers from the show, I would have given this show a 9/10. I hope you guys enjoyed reading my review!",7,Recommended,"Jan 27, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3456af3b8f,4,4703
"I've seen all the episodes broadcast so far, what I can say is that it confirms the expectations I had of this anime, which is one of the best ever made. Past the filler, the series opens in new facets in an incredible way, and the story begins to take hold, smooth as glass with great skill, as it happens in the manga. The only criticism that I can relate to the graphics, which compared to the first series has dropped in quality, not much is clear, however, an improvement was due at least as quality goes the others Anime. The sound, I would say that there are not equal, along with Bleach, I think they are the best soundtracks ever made for an anime, there are no words to describe the great and splendid quality of the music that accompany the anime. There is everything in Naruto, comedy, drama, spectacular fights, psychology ... I repeat, nothing is missing. For this reason I think it is superior to all other anime of its kind, even when compared to giants like Dragon Ball. The last comment: Although perfection does not exist, I put 10 because I saw that the negative votes were the result of the insertion of filler which in effect have created much discussion, I shared it too, but it seems too fall into exasperation, because they are interesting and related to story. STORY: The story starts from the drain Sasuke. The protagonist in the meantime has to train to be able to bring home his friend and defend himself against Akatsuki, an organization that wants to capture all the devils with tails, also it is precisely in this series that you discover many secrets, like the story of Uchiha’s clan or Naruto’s parents. CHARACTERS: here are introduced to new characters very well characterized, especially the Akatsuki’s members. FIGHTS: here fights are a bit longer and made much better than the first series, in some cases are even epic.",9,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9b2938660f,4,1857
"Naruto is my favorite anime so this review will be a long one. If I had to describe Naruto in just one sentence, I would say, ""An Epic Journey of Ninjas, Friendship, and Self-Discovery."" This masterpiece not only offers epic and thrilling battles but also presents rich and profound character development, engaging storytelling, and a lasting message of perseverance and friendship. As someone who grew up following Naruto, this journey was more than just an anime - it was a fundamental part of my own growth journey. Let's start with the fights. Naruto is widely recognized for its intense and exciting battles, skillfully choreographed and full of thrilling twists. From the epic clashes between Naruto and Sasuke to battles against threats like Pain and Madara, each fight is an action masterpiece that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. However, the true heart of Naruto lies in its character development. Throughout the series, we witness the growth and evolution not only of the protagonist but also of a diverse cast of characters such as Sasuke, Sakura, and Kakashi, each with their own emotional struggles and journeys. In particular, Naruto's transformation from an undisciplined and lonely kid into a full-grown man and hero is inspiring and emotional. His dream of becoming Hokage is not just a personal ambition but a testament to the power of hard work and determination to overcome adversity. His unwavering determination and indomitable spirit serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for viewers, teaching valuable lessons about hard work, friendship, and self-discovery along the way. Furthermore, Naruto is rich in universal themes such as love, loss, redemption, and sacrifice. Moments of humor and camaraderie are balanced with moments of great emotion and drama, creating a truly captivating and multifaceted viewing experience. The fact that I grew up following Naruto makes this journey even more meaningful to me. As Naruto faced challenges and overcame obstacles, I was also going through my own experiences of growth and learning. Through his struggles and triumphs, I found inspiration and courage to face real-life challenges. In summary, Naruto is more than just an anime - it's an exciting and inspiring journey that resonates deeply with viewers. If you haven't watched it yet, I encourage you to embark on this life-changing adventure.",10,Recommended,"Mar 26, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f98e435b31,4,2377

The series occasionally suffers from pacing issues, particularly during certain filler episodes that deviate from the main plot. Although these episodes may provide additional character development or backstory, they can test the patience of some viewers.

"It's 2 and a half years since Naruto left to train with the Legendary Sanin Juraiya. You'd expect him to be bad*** right? Guess again. Naruto is still the goofy little kid who still gets his *** handed to him in every fight. What exactly has he learned? No new jutsu to be sure, just learning to control his Kyuuba. That sounds cool but it's really not. This lies a problem with character growth. It's nonexistant in shippuuden until around episode 50 (avoiding spoilers). Naruto still wants to find Sasuke. Guess what? SASUKE WILL NVR COME BACK, GET THAT THROUGH YOU'RE THICK SKULL!!!!! Another problem is the story. Shippy progresses too slowly. Half an episode is just talking, the other half is the slow fighting. It will literally take 5 minutes just for someone to punch the other guy. And the flashbacks are just silly. Why do I need a flashback for something that happened 5 minutes ago? This has happened quite a few times. The character designs aren't bad except Ino's. She looks like a Britney Spears wannabe and who'd wanna be her? I gave Naruto shippuuden a 7, but my review makes me sound like I hate it which is not true. Shippuuden actually has a deep story. If it progressed fast it'd be epic. More about the Akatsuki's goals are revealed and when a fight actually occurs it can become an awsome fight. Naruto Shippuuden also has a different animation style to it that I enjoy. It sets the mood for a dark and deep story which I enjoy. I gave it a 7 because when something good happens it becomes REALLY awsome. The story pacing just keeps it from it's true potential.",7,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_408f58f220,4,1585
"I really, really, REALLY tried to like this show. I was a fan of Naruto (the prequel to Shippuden) and I really enjoyed it.... but trying to finish this show was as fun as watching seniors play checkers. SERIOUSLY. Story: Ehhh it was same old Naruto plots and stories. Easily predictable and boring. Some friend is in a pickle and Naruto goes all emotional to save him even if he met that that guy 2 minutes ago, because he wants to be hokage. Yawn. I saw enough of that in Naruto. Basically, if you watched Naruto and liked it, think of it as the same thing... minus the excitement. Art: It was no eye popper, but it surely was no total trash. The action and fighting scenes are still eye candy for actionholics, but other than that, it pretty much is what you'd call standard Naruto animation. Sound: The sound is possibly the best part of Naruto Shippuden. The OPs are still great, expected from Naruto, and the endings weren't that shabby either... Shooting Star (the first ending) grew to be one of my most favorite endings of all time. Character: All the characters show some development... but in an easily predictable way. Naruto ends up a BIT mature, Sakura grows ladylike... at least for her, and Sasuke grows to be more of a bastard than in Naruto. Some new faces pop up now and then... but they are as memorable as the dust in your belly button. Enjoyment: Now this is where the opinions get diverse. Some Narutoholics will say this is that best thing since Spam and some will say that they watch this show at night just to go to sleep. I'm no Narutoholic so I'd say that the enjoyment for this show is just horrible, but it will be a way for you to waste time if you can get through all the predictable plotlines. Overall: Naruto Shippuden could be, should be, and WILL BE a huge disappointment for Naruto fans who enjoyed the show out of pure action enjoyment. But of course they say that 60% of Naruto watchers end up dying their hair yellow out of love for this show, so it all depends on how you look at Naruto. But overall, Naruto Shippuden isn't something you'd go crazy for. Take my word for it. Overall:",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 20, 2008",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_53ce98419d,4,2124
"Tl;dr: This title is a masterpiece, but with the excessive volume and poor quality of the filler episodes, watching the filler destroys any prolonged enjoyment. This show starts out delivering a 10/10 experience right out of the gate. Its a more mature Naruto with some great villains and a story that keeps on delivering. The anime however falls into the ""we don't have enough content"" category and consistently pushes arc after arc of terrible filler that is by far some of the worst of any show. I don't know why the quality drops so much but it just does. When the show is on manga content it delivers superb animation with great character and scene design, top notch voice acting and music, and an excellent plot with character development. Where I am now with watching the show (roughly episode 415) nearly 30-40% of the show has been filler and the current story line shows 1 or 2 episodes from the manga then goes off on a filler flashback tangent for 10-20 episodes, then back to 1 episode of actual story, then back to another 10 episodes of filler garbage. Specifically right now, we're on our 3rd (maybe 4th) flashback on the same character. I can't stress that enough, we're on the 4th filler line for one specific character and they don't even try to hide that they have 1) no more ideas for original story, and 2) they've transplanted Naruto's character and personality into the other character's past. So basically we're watching Naruto, if Naruto was another character, in the same village. It is a complete degradation of the story back to the original Naruto series before this title grew out of the childish plots and ploys that made that show work, but also makes me never want to return to it again. Awful. I don't have much hope for this pulling any higher than a 6/10 for me at this point. If you had asked me 100 episodes ago if I thought that I would rate this show any less than a 10, I'd tell you that you were out of your mind...

"Story continues where previous Naruto series left off with few years time-skip. If you haven't seen previous series, don't worry. Story this time is full of flashbacks and fillers in case you missed anything from last season. Dialogues are dull, fillers are there just to drag the series (they serve 0 importance and events are instantly forgotten in the first normal episode), pacing is incredibly slow, characters are dumb, fights are predictable. Story in short, Naruto looks for his lost best buddy who is blinded by revenge against pretty much everyone and gets slowly consumed by darkness. One thing lead to another and now Naruto's trying to save the world. Main themes: friendship and determination. Animation is almost non-existant. Most episodes consist of still images with slight mouth or limb movements, this makes them all look awfully stiff. It's painfully obvious that they'd rather change a scene than do proper animation. Even in fights, you can see a lot of changes from one still image to another, because the ""characters move so fast""... .",2,Not Recommended,"Dec 3, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9626cac1ea,5,1060
"Given the voracity of the backlash against the ""not-so-bad"" rating that Naruto received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Naruto is plainly more hype than substance. So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Naruto, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Naruto will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Naruto the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality. The characters, like the plot, are mostly OK while being admittedly cliched. Uzumaki Naruto, our primary character, is much like the leads of many of the most popular fight-styled anime. Like Goku (of Dragon Ball fame), Naruto is headstrong, motivated (mostly to become stronger), and cares deeply about his comrades. Like Yuusuke (of Yu Yu Hakusho fame), Naruto is rambunctious, brash, and a bit of a slacker. Despite his being particularly formulaic, Naruto at least combines the finer qualities of his predecessors. Such can not be said of his archrival Sasuke, a figure for whom blandness knows no depth. In fact, many of the characters fall somewhere in-between Sasuke's blandness and Naruto's charisma and coolness. You will come to care for the cast of Naruto for sure, just not at any deep or meaningful level. The animation, much like the characterization and plotting, is spotty. At times great while at other times shoddy, the quality of the animation here lacks any real consistency. During the arcs in which the animation is still on the minds of the animators, the viewer is treated to a fluid frame-rate and artistic renderings that leave little to be desired on the part of fans of the manga. Nevertheless, when the animation is bad it is painful. At these times the once faithful renderings degrade to craptastic levels. It is as if you can feel the framerates slipping before your very eyes. Like most aspects thus far examined, the animation of Naruto is a mixed bag indeed. It is perhaps a bit unfair though to judge a fight/action anime based upon factors such as characterization and plotting. True to its genre, it is in fight/action scenes that Naruto receives is highest accolades, though that isn't saying a whole hell of a lot. Despite very wide employment, the fight scenes manage to remain remarkably fresh. With such a large extended cast, invigorating and unique fighting styles/techniques manage to continuously infuse action sets with life. Additionally, the background music manages to add some tension to these scenes quite effectively. There are some negative aspects to the action sets however. One is the overemployment of certain special techniques, particularly Naruto's Shadow Clone technique, a move in which he creates multiple clones of himself. When a character uses the same move over and over and over and . . . well, things get bland and repetitive. Another detriment is that the sheer number of fights impedes the potency of plotting. Still, the combat stages are pretty intense and there are plenty of scenes for action fans to get pumped about. How one feels about Naruto probably depends, in good part, on their anime viewing mileage. As a person that has been watching anime for a decade and a half, there isn't too much here that I haven't seen done better elsewhere. However, it has managed to get better as it progresses. Although uneven in most aspects, this show is a good introductory title that will likely bring many newcomers into the fold of anime fandom. In closing, Naruto, while being better than worse without a doubt, doesn't quite succeed in being as mind-blowing as the hype-machine would have you believe. This anime volleys between a two-star and a four-star feature depending upon your anime viewing mileage and how easily you can stomach an anime so action laden. If you are relatively new to anime and a fan of DragonBall Z and YuYu Hakusho, it is a four-star feature. Otherwise, this is a three-star series at best",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 19, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_75044d0a25,5,4890
"The series brings some new things, and repeats some old weaknesses to the storytelling. I'm assuming that anyone reading this has seen at least some of the original series, so please do so if you have not before reading this. Story: Just as there was a timeskip and gap between series in the anime, the author took a slight break between the two series too. Which places the studio in an awkward position of when to start releasing the anime series and what pace to set. Afterall, the reason for almost 100 filler episodes in the original series was to give the manga author time to work. Even then they are catching up frighteningly fast and are already beginning to ""pepper"" in a couple of filler arcs. Unlike the old filler arcs however, these segue nicely into the original plot and don't stand out as much as the old ones did. As for what happens, it picks up as Naruto returns to Konoha after 2 and a half years of training with Jiraiya. I will say that I'm somewhat dissappointed with how little he's improved. Pervy Sage must be a slack-off because the other characters seem to have improved a lot more than Naruto has (even though he's all around stronger, faster, etc.). He's matured a little, but of course that leaves room for improvement. As Jiraiya stated before filler hell settled in during the first series, he intended them to return right as Akatsuki would begin to move and Sasuke's life would be in potential danger. That prediction is dead on as after he is back less than a day Akatsuki begins it's quest to capture all the ""jinchuriki"" (ninja who have tailed beasts within them) starting with Gaara. You can go on your own from there. Art: The world seems less...fresh than it did in the first series. They, so far mind you, have stuck to the seemingly endless woods around Konoha and a brief foray in the lands of the Sand Village (Sonagakure). The difference in character design is fascinating, all due to the original author of course. Both Sai and Yamato are intriguing for their lack of distinguishing features. While all the other characters are as notable for their looks as their personalities. Of course all the original young ninja have matured, all hanging around ~15 yo by the looks of things. The differences are largely subtle and well done. Sound: This is the biggest letdown. Not because it's poor quality, but because it's always the same 3 tracks playing. There is no variety in music and the same ""Battle/danger"" music plays all the time. The variety of music from the first series is gone and that is sad because the original Naruto has an excellent soundtrack. Character: Naruto is much the same, but tempered with maturity in that he is able to understand others (except Sakura of course) much better. He is still obsessed with rescuing Sasuke, and is still reckless and rash. He seems especially stagnated in comparison to the others who have all become Chunin and even Jonin. Naruto does show maturity when he learns that Gaara has not only surpassed him but has achieved his own goal by coming Kazekage of his village (though it's later revealed it was for political reasons). Sakura has changed the most. One of my fav moments from the new series is how she actually becomes interested in Naruto (noting his physique has matured) but is quickly disuaded by discovering his lack of ""coolness"" (aka bragging about a ""new"" sexy jutsu to Konahamaru and telling her that she looked the same (she's ""filled out"" BTW)). Due to 9 tailed fox's increased power within Naruto, and the fact that they are lacking Sasuke, Tsunade assigns two former ANBU members to join their squad (Kakashi ends up back in the hospital right away of course). They are Yamato and Sai. Yamato is the result of one of Orochimaru's experiments, which gives him the powers of the first Hokage. These are the power of wood element (he can build a mansion in seconds) and limited control over tailed beasts, namely the nine-tailed fox by using the pendant that Tsunade gave Naruto. Frequently they play off his amazingly blank face. Naruto, and the viewers for that matter, find his face kinda eerie at times. They don't hesitate to have fun with this. He's very kind-hearted though and looks up to Kakashi, calling him Senpai (implying that he served under him in ANBU. (note: Yamato is not his real name, but he continues to use it) Sai, is originally planted in the group by Danzo, the leader of ANBU root and Tsunade's political nemesis within Konoha. Trained not to show any emotion, he eventually begins to respond to Naruto and the others. He provides a lot of comic relief by trying to interract with the others. Enjoyment: It's not as groundbreaking as the orignal, but the series continues to be fun. Naruto continues to grow and mature over the (now 100 episodes) series and is even learning to better use his current jutsus, thanks to Kakashi actually involving himself in Naruto's training for the first time. The gags continue a lot but now that characters are actually dying (other than enemies or the elderly (3rd Hokage) it's gotten more serious as well. Overall: The series has a long ways to go, and since the author is far from finished it will be interesting how they decide to keep pace. They are currently on their 2nd filler arc. The first was somewhat silly, but gave everyone background on Asuma which is very important for reasons I refuse to give away at this time. The 2nd seems to be explaining where the 3-tails jinchuriki came from so it'll be interesting to see how they handle it. Of course the original story is very strong and fast paced. To this date the highlight of the series has definately been when Naruto takes on Orochimaru. It helps you appreciate just how strong Orochimaru is. The battles with the Akatsuki have been fascinating, mostly because they have so few weaknesses and how hard the Konoha ninja have to work to defeat them.",7,Recommended,"Mar 29, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4e80370bb7,5,5892
"Note: Review has been suitably edited to match my views on the anime as of present time. Will have spoilers. You've been warned. -I'm not a native english speaker, there may be some errors. Please accept my apology.- Naruto or Naruto Shippuuden? If I were to compare naruto and naruto shippuuden, somewhere down the line I would still prefer the former. Although I accept naruto shippuden has better fight scenes, the disappointing twists and turns have multiplied considerably too. Characters: Naruto shippuuden has an army of fans for a reason, and one of the biggest reason is this - the characters. Almost all types of people will find atleast one lovable character in this series, not to mention there are so many! In naruto there are no outright good or bad guys. Almost every character is very believable although sometimes they tend to get repetitive (spoiler >> all those ""healed"" by naruto pretty much have the same sob history as him. Gaara, pein..why?) Character development: The leads: The thing I find irritating about the series is that sasuke is hyped too much. (haven't we had enough of mourning for sasuke while the characters grew up?) ..and yet he is nowhere to be seen. I'd prefer if the entire series stops going hush hush about him and actually have him take up proper screen space for once. The ""mystery"" charm is not working anymore, in fact its getting irritating. In the recent episodes, naruto's significance has considerably increased which makes me happy because to me it somewhat always felt like naruto as the lead was being sidelined a bit. A character's importance is not entirely calculated by his screen space. He has grown up wonderfully after his recent encounters with akatsuki, and for once something in naruto made me feel all happy like the good ol' naruto series. Sasuke, he seems to be really strong now after training for years under Orochimaru but much can't be said as the anime hasn't progressed so far. The manga is another ball, ofcourse. Although on personal or emotional level (whatever way you like to see it) he still remains the b@st@rd who will not even twitch for a split second before tossing naruto's feelings aside; who along with sakura is still ever so determined to bring him back home. Such level of coldness for someone who loves and cares for you so much is not ""cool"", its outright irritating. The third and probably the most criticised one, sakura, is a complete contrast from her old days now. While the heartache of losing sasuke is still there, she's become a gem of a medical ninja AND has the much in/famous montrous strength inherited from Tsunade; which is impressive. I don't mind if she's not in the war zone fighting, as long as she is good in what she's doing which she is, so even though I didn't like sakura initially; I do not completely agree to her being criticized now. I just hope they give her more significant role to play. Also, her relation with naruto has developed considerably and in a good way. The side sicks: spoiler >>One thing I find really irritating with this series is that every character you start liking meets an unexpected end, and not in a good way. Sasuke is TEH GOD, naruto is the broken hearted kid in distress and sakura..well she still exists. Not that I have any grudge against sasuke, infact he used to be one of my favourites in naruto series; but I think there are far too many good characters with great potential in the series that are majorly sidelined while sasuke is being hyped to the level that it left some fans irritated. (Again I must go back to the point that if he is so important then don't have almost 100 episodes with pretty much no screen presence of him at all! Talk less and show more is what I want to say, and minus the army of fangirls if at all possible.) Akatsuki: SPOILERZZZZZZ!! What excited me most about naruto shippuudin is akatsuki. What excited me most about the entire naruto universe ever since I came to know something like akatsuki existed is AKATSUKI. When they were finally introduced, I was nearly ready to shed tears of joy. I guess that was one of the very rare fangirlish moment I had in my life as an otaku. But the way it happened made my jaw fall on the floor. With disappointment, that is. They make an awesome character like hidan, and he pretty much (almost) dies with not even one ""proper"" fight. It left me utterly frustated. And I just couldn't understand someone like kakuzu who survived a fight the great you-know-who got his ass handed to him just like that by naruto. Okay, naruto got stronger and all that but still, the transition was a bit too sudden for me to believe. As for sasori I really can't complain because what happened was no surprise (and one thing .. please he did not get owned by sakura. I find it so hard to believe why people keep forgetting that someone who actually knew so much about him was there too!! Defeat was only natural).. but I'd have been really happy if he had made a come back or something. Whatever, illogical demands.. heh. Anime progress: Another blooper is the progress of anime. With animes where anime and manga have become quite close, frequent fillers are acceptable and NEEDED. But naruto manga is like..zillion light years away from the anime then what is the need of such slow progress? I dropped naruto at ep 100 due to its slow progress and temporarily switched to other animes. Once it gains its pace, being a narutard I'm; I'll most likely be lured into watching naruto again. Animation: Something is wrong with naruto's quality, its not just the same anymore. The anatomy sometimes is horribly wrong .. to the point that you're able to notice it even when something really interesting is going on. The jumping from trees to trees scenes almost always look like people are flying, and some things just don't make sense anymore. Considering that the anime takes its own sweet time in progressing compared to manga, this type of quality is a major setback to fans but if you're a narutard fear not. You'll pretty much still be glued to this anime no matter how bad it gets. Sound: I'm one of those people who don't get bothered a lot by sound unless its so off to the point that its ruining the scene so I pretty much find the sounds okay. The openings and ending except one or two aren't all that great compared to other animes but still fine. The biggest setback.. fansub: This is not important and perhaps not related.. but while I'm at it why not cover this too? We all know dattebayo, if you don't then you probably don't watch naruto and shouldn't be reading this review because its full of spoilers. Anyway, the biggest setback came to me when crunchyroll took up naruto leading dattebayo to drop it. My source of watching HQ naruto was lost because DB won't sub it, crunchyroll won't air it for our country because its licensed here and I won't get to see it because for whatever xyz reasons CR doesn't know, NARUTO IS NOT ON SALE HERE! Shipping from abroad costs more than the actual anime, which is obviously not an option. And its not just me, a huge chuck of anime fans in my country stopped watching naruto for the same reason after DB dropped it. In a nutshell, I think naruto shippuuden is a good anime with outstanding characters, but not-so-good priorities and balance between characters. Neverthless, it still deserves at least one time watch. Its one of the most popular anime of today's time, reviews only matter upto a limit.. don't they?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 7, 2009",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e53cbee83b,5,7476
"A much more ambitious continuation to its predecessor. Introduces brand new concepts, expands on lore, and keeps up with the themes of bonds/friendship and ending the cycle of hatred. Though it has some pacing issues and polarizing decision-making at times, this remains a favourite series to many for its climactic fights, emotional moments and diverse cast of characters. While the original series is definitely more cohesive and grounded, Shippuden has much higher highs. No beating around the bush, it is a flawed show, but the positives outweigh the negatives and offer some of the most iconic sequences in anime history. Additionally, Naruto: Shippuden covers a wide range of genres throughout its 500 episode run. There is something for everyone from dazzling fight animation to romantic subplots to fleshed-out side character stories. All in all, this is an absolute must watch for fans of the original series and the universe it's set in. Enjoy the show, and prepare to cry.",8,Recommended,"Dec 2, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f33020c864,5,983
"Naruto...one of the most popular anime to ever be created, and one of the big players in mainstream shonen anime. Regardless of whether you love Naruto or hate it, you have to admit it did something right -- nothing can get this popular while being very bad. Story -- 9 The story of Naruto is probably the best and worst quality of this anime. It's built around the complex world of ninjas (shinobi) that is very carefully crafted with hundreds of characters, tons of ninja abilities (jutsus), and an immersive system of countries/villages. All this creates an almost surreal realistic effect. The amount of work it takes to actually become well versed in all of Naruto-dom is a lot, but anyone that watches the 400+ episodes combined between Naruto and Shippuuden will learn them. So the greatest part of this anime is that it is large, evolving, changing. But the world, can, be at times, almost TOO large. You can have one episode in the middle of Konoha (Village Hidden in the Leaves in the dub) and then suddenly jump to a location far far away, with little pretext. While that's fine and dandy, it's hard to jump from place to place and time to time. Some episodes also are happening at subsequent times with others: randomly making up numbers, but 42 and 43 could happen at the same time in the Naruto world -- just in different places. The world is great, but the method they use to show it can be jumpy and confusing at points to someone that isn't used to it. Art -- 6 The art in Naruto isn't bad. Well, yes it is. Wait, no it's not. Wait, yes it is. And that basically sums up the art in Naruto -- it will be pristine one moment, then trash the next. I remember at one point during one of the ever-so-long filler arcs, the art quality got so bad that you could just see straight lines for people's edges, rather than the often used inventions known as curved lines. But as soon as the story came back into the main story arc, the art suddenly jumped back. I think even the studio that works on Naruto gets tired of the filler, sometimes. Overall, it would be a 7 or 8 normally, but due to the laziness of the studio in some episodes, I'm bumping it down to a 6. Sound -- 8 The other great thing about popular shows is that they can always have an amazing soundtrack. This is true for both Naruto the original and Shippuuden. The opening, closings, and themes of Naruto are not overly complex, but recognizable and not harsh on the ears. Some memorable themes from both series would have to include ""Blue Bird,"" ""Sadness & Sorrow,"" and ""Sengunbanba."" Though they are spread out -- most of the openings and closings aren't bad, just not memorable -- there are the occasional few that you will remember and think ""that music paired up so well."" At one point, a very emotional instrumental piece -- Sadness & Sorrow -- was played during the funeral of one of the ninja leaders. The somber attitude, good artwork (for once! hooray!) and moody and powerful music allowed that particular episode to stay in people's minds. Character -- 7 Character, character, character. The characters of Naruto are always evolving, changing, etc., etc. But the problem is -- is that when you have such a large world, with a couple hundred characters, the majority of them will get put on the side. So you are introduced to Awesome Character Z, who you love for maybe 10 or 20 episodes. But then they're put to the side, and they just become filler every now and then -- it's hard to include everyone. The main characters' development is nice, to say a lot. If you compare the Naruto at the start of the original series to the Naruto now, a lot has changed. Even more so if you compare it to what has happened in the manga. It basically follows his life from the 12 year old child everyone hates (you know there is one of those kids you hate in your life, don't lie!) to a respectable and caring adult (ish?) person. Of course, he's still the same old perverted, bloody-nosed kid on the inside, but the change in attitude, thinking, and manners is noticeable to say the least. Other characters -- specifically Hinata -- are thrust into a main-supporting role, with small development -- she basically has a crush on him which cripples her, and then she has to confront that and either save herself or Naruto in order to be productive, and stays like this for well, the entire series. These sort of characters (see: Temari, Gaara, Hinata, Neji, etc.) are basically only used for the advancement of the main characters (see: Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Sai, etc.). Enjoyment -- 7 Okay. Filler. Filler. Filler. OMG Awesome episode-! No, wait, filler. The enjoyment of Naruto is spliced up -- the fillers are generally boring and only put out to keep the massive drones that support Naruto appeased -- but I have to admit, there are some pretty awesome fight sequences and battle scenes. If you are one of the people who likes to skip over / breeze through filler, then you will get a greater enjoyment out of Naruto Shippuuden as a whole. It seems as of late like they've been stretching each of the episodes out a little more than needed (as if to give the manga an already larger head start which it doesn't need), but I'm willing to chalk that up as a decision to explain what's happening fully. At the moment, a lot of complicated drama and plots are coming together and unfolding, so the pace doesn't need to be as fast as in the manga. Regardless, counting filler, enjoyment is about a 7. Without it, it would be an 8 or 8.5; just filler would be a 4.5ish. So as a whole, it's a 7. Overall - 7.5 TLDR: You can't really put ""halfs"" on these reviews, so I decided to be generous and give it that extra .5. Out of the ""kings"" of shonen mainstream anime, Naruto definitely is not the worst (see: One Piece, Bleach) but not as refined as the best (see:Fullmetal Alchemist). It has very strong story and sound elements, and can have both very crappy and very well made art. The character development for main characters is fantastic -- just not so much for the static and supporting characters. The enjoyment value is high when it's following the manga and not in filler -- it is dismal when it is in filler, though. Overall, it's a decent series. Maybe not watching 400 episodes worth if you want to catch up / are starting new, but not a bad series by any means.",7,Recommended,"Jan 6, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5f3a57627e,5,6344
"I started watching Naruto the wrong way. The first thing I knew about Naruto was his battle with Pain. Then after that, I began watching Jiraiya's fight with Nagato. Sakura and Granny Chiyo's battle with Sasori. The Third Hokage's death. And so on... I missed a lot of episode, nevertheless, I knew I should begin with the first episode not in Shippuuden but in the original Naruto itself. But nooo. I was so stubborn so I began to read the manga first. Ever since I heard that Naruto has ended, I was itching to read its manga for good. And I did. A week later, I found myself crying and inspired. I regret not paying attention to such an amazing manga. STORY : Some would say I'm exaggerating, but for me, Naruto is what I can proudly say a ""masterpiece"". I love Naruto so much it pains my kokoro. Any month now, or maybe a year, Shippuuden will end like a flash. Fillers may make this masterpiece a junk but I assure you, some fillers are worth a shot. If you hate it, then don't watch it. The pacing will still be the same. Naruto will remain the same. I may not be a super Naruto fanatic, I can't call myself that yet. Naruto may not be my childhood favorite but it is my inspiration. The heck with Naruto-more-then-a-decade fans. I, too, has Naruto inside me. Ninjustu. Gengutsu. Taijutsu. Senjutsu. Fuinjutsu. There are so many justu to elaborate with but that makes this anime special. Over the past decade, I hear many jutsu throughout my community. I remember how I used to play games on my friends ps3. Naruto here, Naruto there. Even now, when I attend cosplay events, Naruto is still popular. I always ask myself why. Why is Naruto so popular? Is the anime even this good? Why is Sasuke such a news word in the society? Now I know why : it's because you can never change time. You can never change hearts. You can never change memories. Naruto has its own place in the anime industry. As well as any other anime out there. Even if A LOT are already tired of fillers and unending battles, this anime will never waver. Who could ever forget Naruto famous ""I'll become a Hokage"" quote? I'm sure that I won't. (10/10) CHARACTER : Ahhh. This is what I love the most in this anime. So let's start with Naruto Uzumaki. The Nine Tails Jinchuriki. The prophecy child. Who would not love Naruto, anyway? He may be a loser, a brat, a stupid shinobi, but who would have thought that he could can the whole shinobi world? Naruto's development started when people hated him more and more as he grows up. And later did he blossom when a person finally acknowledge him. He is not just the nine tails jinchuriki. He is Naruto Uzumaki. And he will become a hokage. A man full of words is better than a man who doesn't recognize his worth. And there's come Sasuke. Sasuke Uchiha, the avenger (coughs). Kidding! I honestly hated Sasuke at first. Unlike Naruto, he only wants vengeance. He locks his self in his own wicked world. He wanted to become strong to kill the person who attacked his village, his parents, his everything. I know it must have been painful to witness your beloved killed also by your beloved, but putting everything aside for vengeance? Alright, that's pretty much okay. No one could ever stop you anyway. And if it wasn't for Sasuke the avenger, things would not end up the way it is in the end. Everyone has a purpose in life. Despite of everything he did, I'd still want him back. He's home is Konohagakure after all. And as for Sakura. Oh, I love her development. From a weak and fragile girl to a strong and powerful woman indeed. I never hated her, really. She has her own issues and I respected that. She love Sasuke (who doesn't?) so much that she was willing to do everything for him. Love is a battle, and so she took her own path by becoming a shinobi that can stand by herself. She is a character that has an open development. Watch the anime and you'll see how she strive everything for her to be acknowledge the same way the rest of the Team 7 were. There are many more characters to praise. Everyone changed for the better. They had their own pain, happiness, beliefs. Thank you specially for Naruto's Will of Fire for leading the shinobi world. Everything was worth it. (10/10) ART AND SOUND : I am not really good when it comes to analyzing the art style but from what I saw, it was an okay for me. There are some fights that I was expecting a lot of animations but thank you for the sound and effects my feels stays the same. I love how the sound can be so perfect from time to time. There are many soundtracks too that I would love to listen over and over. The background music is always fitting with the atmosphere. It makes me cry, ya know!!! I just hope the animation will be amazing in the last part of the series. (MadaraxGuy / SasukexNaruto fight pls) ENJOYMENT : I cried. I laughed. I felt the pain and the hopes of many shinobi in this anime. And I wouldn't have asked for more. Thank you for the roller coaster ride, Naruto. Thank you for teaching me not to give up. Thank you for the comfort and love that I haven't realized all these years. And oh, thank you Kishimoto Sensei for creating Naruto. I love you so much, thank you thank you thank you!!! Words will never be enough for inspiring me to believe in myself. I will never give up. No matter how hard life may be, I'll always remember Naruto's will of never giving up. ""And my future dream is to be the greatest Hokage! Then the whole village will stop disrespecting me and start treating me like I'm somebody. Somebody important!"" - Naruto Uzumaki This anime is worth a shot. Try watching every episode and refrain from skipping fillers. Some of it may be very important, ya know! ""A masterpiece will never be considered as a flawless creation nor idea. Everything and everyone has its own flaws and mistakes. Nevertheless, a masterpiece is considered to be acknowledge and not to be judge by others."" And that is what I learned from watching this amazing anime.

"Tales of perseverance and redemption dominate Naruto: Shippuuden, but the delivery stumbles into the familiar trap of idealistic overkill. Conflicts that should challenge characters morally or strategically often dissolve into speeches about friendship, willpower, or destiny—rendering complex struggles toothless. Every major villain is eventually revealed to be misunderstood or tragic, stripped of their menace to fit a world where no one is truly evil, just hurt. While the intent might be noble, the execution feels disingenuous. All episodes were watched—not out of enjoyment, but out of habit. Completionism has its curses, and few shows test that like this one. The show leans heavily on emotional highs, recycling the same themes until they lose impact. Real nuance rarely survives its determination to turn every story into a morality tale.",4,Not Recommended,"Apr 15, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e04dfd3efd,5,850
"Watching this after it has ended and having the luxury to skip over the filler episodes leaves me with no choice but to put Naruto in the GOAT debate. I won't go into any details as I'm sure most people are familiar with the story of Naruto. However, and in true MAL fashion, I have to rate everything as part of my review. Story: 10/10 Characters: 10/10 Music: 11/10 Everything: 10/10 Not many animes out there can stand the test of time but Naruto/Naruto Shippuden certainly is one that can and has already done so. The story that started with the clueless orange jumpsuit-wearing kid ended up becoming a global cultural phenomenon. Without exaggeration, this anime is responsible for a generational shift in anime culture. As Naruto was probably many people's first anime, it has largely contributed in moving anime to the mainstream. Stories like Naruto has kept audiences captivated for over 15 years keeping those who started it when they young captivated until its end, and until its audience grew older. This anime does not get the credit or the respect it deserves when it is literally one that changed people's perception of anime. Also, anyone that tries to put Naruto down is an edgelord who tries to stand out from the rest and probably enjoys something lame like slice of life animes.",10,Recommended,"Aug 7, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_713bd586a9,5,1298
"It's been nearly 4 years since I reviewed the original Naruto and nearly 8 since I finished watching the Japanese dub. Being bored of recent anime seasons I decided to watch Shippuden. Gosh... 3 months later and 400+ episodes finished and here I am. I'm old now but not quite old enough to be jaded on things I used to love. I still love and enjoy the original Naruto and series like Naruto. It's a light hearted, filled with emotion show that just pulls all the right strings. It's a show that I can rewatch random episodes and still feel the same way as if I was watching it for the first time. Naruto ended on good terms, the turn of Sasuke seemed like a natural progression which was foreshadowed since the beginning. A classic betrayal that didnt need a 500+ episodes. Well.. that's what I thought heading into Shippuuden and boy I was wrong. There was so much more story that needed to be told. While the first half I commented on the strength of the side characters. Shippuuden is about Naruto, when he is absent the show drags. And it drags quite a bit with filler and some boring arcs. But if you go pass the fillers (which have improved somewhat with some really good moments) you get just pure shounen goodness. I'm updating this review to reflect the entirety of Shippuuden. The show is massive there's some good aspects some pretty bad and downright terrible moments. The ninja war arc was overblown and must have been terrible to watch week in. Together it kind of works but barely. What saves the show is Naruto himself. What started as an annoying titular character becomes Naruto the hokage during shippuuden. It's hard to stay with a series for 10+ yrs and almost 1K episodes. So hard in fact if you did end up finishing both series you're pretty much automatically a fanboy/girl. I can see why the fandom died down in favor of shorter with a more 'impact per episode' quotient. However watching Naruto grow up over that long period makes it feel more significant. In that way it surpasses it's contemporaries plus the new upstarts.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_6290be85fa,5,2050
"""Naruto is Naruto"" and though Ive only seen the first 5-8 episodes I would still keep watching it. The only thing you should expect from naruto is a great fight scene and a great story. I didn't think it was that different from the older naruto. The characters do however act differently, such as naruto. Ive seen the new guy and all that. Instead of comparing this to the old naruto, you should be looking forward as things will change when he gets old and you should expect that from a series that continues as the characters get older. Things have definitely got more serious but the fighting is way better. I stopped watching old naruto at episode 120 because it became to childish for me(even though I really love the series). This is why I like shippuuden. Because they have taken a more serious approach with the series.

"15 years. It's the reason I have for this to steal my heart despite its flaws. The story of a loser who changes the world. Positive symbolism is through everything, characters serving as general explanations for wrong human behaviours and the complexity of life are all stirred in a thick and massive stew of characters, affiliation, thoughts, perspectives, feelings...Naruto is a huge world with lots of stories and depth. And of course with so much time you can tell so much but this also means that the franchise targeted a few stages of teenage years to create something bigger than the story itself by adding the element of time to the viewing experience. Some people will call it undeserved hype, but they also probably masturbate to stuff like Aoi Bungaku, Steins:Gate or animes that did not get a second season but oh boy was it going somewhere. This anime is timeless, Naruto and Miyazaki are immortal and if we would be fair enough to only grant access at an hypothetical bar in upscale London to animes that were able to obtain such status, the bar would never be short on staff.

"Naruto series is the reason why i started watching anime and Shippuden is honestly one of the best anime i've ever watched,or simply,the best. i kinda have a perfect life, unlike naruto, but i can relate to him at some point. i'm touched by how naruto is determined to work hard so that the village would acknowledge him as someone who is worth to be watched. Despite his lonely and sad childhood, he didn't let those things to overcome him to become dark, but instead, he let those sad memories as a fuel to drive him to become a better person. i love everything about his character, his annoying yet funny stupidity, his unconditional love towards his friends and comrades, his endless hard work even when everything around him comes crashing down. most importantly, i love how he use his past to understand others instead of judging them. being as strong as he is but still is humble enough to lower himself for something he believes in is just pure inspiration. from being a loner to being around many loyal friends and comrades and have the trust of all shinobi in other hidden villages. he will make an amazing hokage. this anime might be fictional, but i value this anime so much it has more meaning and depth than that. im very sad that this anime is coming to an end, but this anime and the messages it contains will forever live. thank you Kishimoto for this amazing journey you've shared with me and the rest of naruto's fans.

There are very select fight scenes that occur every year or so that are well done, but the corners they've been cutting to keep animation budgets at a minimum is not well hidden. Half of the episodes are now filler that are completely intrusive and have no place in the show. The episodes are now long and drawn out with flash backs or long pauses.

I got so excited as I thought this was gonna be so awesome. Like the be all to end all clash of epicness. The first two arcs were pretty damn good I'll give that. There were some tearful moments when a few of you're favorite characters were seen dying. I thought that was a good way to really get you hooked. But by the end of it Naruto Shippuuden felt like such an after thought. Now for me the original anime got so many things right. The character development was big for some of the characters, The action was enjoyable and of course it really kept you excited for things. My only real complaints were that the filler lasted forever sometimes and it felt like it was taking too much inspiration from a lot of anime. As they were targeting the right audience for both kids and adults. It had just enough humor and serious action for all the fans. But let me get to why Shippuden basically fails on some degree. The first point is that Naruto himself seriously lacks character development. I mean sure he does learn a new jutsu here and there. But he lacks his own sense of humor compared to the original series. It's also very hard to feel for him most of the time. The only time I ever really felt any sympathy for Naruto was when someone special to him died. I'm not going to spoil any of the big moments as if you are curious you can check it out for yourself. The rest of the other character development is take it or leave it. You'll have to decide for yourself which characters you love the most. The storyline this time around is nothing to write home about. While I will give it something for trying to connect everything more. Also the fact that it tries to be very mature in some parts. Though its something I can't get into in general. The fights are also really awesome to some degree. It has a lot of amazing moments and it was really good. But I seriously began to lose interest after some filler arcs and when I was two or three arcs into Shippuuden. The artwork however is very good in general. I think the anime looks very sharp overall and the presentation is quite good to me. The music is great once again. With traditional Japanese music and some epic orchestra music thrown in. The presentation might be one of Shipuuden's strong points. Overall Naruto Shippuden is something that has dissapointed me. I did really enjoy the fights to some degree. The music and artwork is also quite good as well. But to a degree this has dissapointed me so much. The emotion also feels very lacking and you could really careless about the story. But I find it very difficult to really enjoy Naruto Shippuuden in general.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 14, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7e2bc30bb1,5,2777
"Well I dropped this a while back, but I figure I leave a little something regarding it. Naruto was one of the first anime that I did pick up when I was actually getting serious about watching. I watched the original series, OVAs, and movies. It was ok overall, but I felt it could do something with that story. Then comes along Shippuuden, which I thought it would do expand the story and make naruto seriously epic. I was wrong. I don't even know how I managed to get to episode 255 including all those countless filler. I mean sure Bleach and One Piece have fillers, but Naruto takes it to a whole different level. I really can barely recall at least 5 episodes for Naruto that were seriously epic. So on that note, no more naruto for me. I may peep the manga from time to time, but its not a priority.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 3, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1c28c7ac17,5,804
"Alright, Naruto Shippuuden itself is badass. You just can't help but to love certain characters, the action is great and the emotion is there but most of the times you either won't care or you won't even notice. The music in the anime is fantastic and really gives that ninja/shinobi feel, especially due to iconic Japanese instruments such as the shamisen. Some tracks may be overused a bit, but it's not bothering in general. It just makes certain moments predictable. Although I love the story, I can't stand the fillers and flashbacks. They use flashbacks and fillers on the most inappropriate moments. Let me give you an example: In the middle of the final battle they will throw 12 fillers in your face. After that they continue with the final battle for one episode, and while a character's performing a major act for the story.. he decides to have a flashback, continued with another flashback episode. Seriously, it's ridiculous. It totally ruins the atmosphere, excitement and enjoyment. They also repeat a lot of scenes from flashbacks, heck I wouldn't be surprised if some episodes are the exact same, but with the scenes in another order. This is why I rate Naruto Shippuuden a 6 overall. I find myself saying ""AH NO"" way too often on the first frame of the ""Next time on Naruto Shippuuden!"" at the end of every episode, which isn't a good sign. Will they make it better with the episodes to come? Time will tell.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 8, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f958bc310e,5,1426
"Naruto didn’t just entertain me—it shaped me. As a kid, it wasn’t just a story about ninjas; it was a story about being different, about standing tall when everyone told you to sit down. Naruto’s journey from the outcast nobody believed in to someone who inspired the world felt like my own. Every time he yelled, fought, cried, smiled and showed how he still continued his journey, I believed in myself just a little more. Plus great fights, great complex and connected stories. Sure, it’s not perfect—what is? But for me, it’s more than an anime. It’s the late nights trying to pull off a Rasengan, the hours spent working hard in myself, the weeks when I wanted to give up on many things just to remember Naruto's way, and even the tattoo I got as a permanent reminder of what Naruto taught me: that hard work, heart, and stubbornness can beat the odds.

"Naruto Shippuden. This show is both loved and demised. I personally like the series, it's good and nice to watch, nothing overly amazing and not that much overly crap shoot stuff I hate. (OH WAIT) Story: 7 The story in Shippuden is nice, all wrapped up with a bow. At times it is serious and somewhat thrilling to watch, and other times you're blowing bubbles in your chocolate milk as people talk about stuff for over a minute. The overall plot in the story stays the same almost the entire way through, Naruto wants to ""save"" Sasuke, somehow stop Akatsuki, and be recognized by the village. The last one happens after Pain is defeated, and none of the other ones have happened so far so, more sludging through. (WEEEE) Art: 6 The animation changes so much throughout this series, in such varying degrees and yes, I know that the studio has a budget, but when you use the same flashback over five times, barely even ****ing shade anything, keep characters frozen still while they're talking, and try to pass off people staring at each other for a FULL MINUTE as part of the show, you start to wonder how Studio Pierrot is even doing. But the show does have nice, fantastic animation. It's just not as frequent. Also, some of the best animation and shading I've seen in this show have been during fights and the OPs and EDs, and some other places throughout. Sound: 7 This is a another reason why people hate Shippuden. I'm not talking about the voice actors, they're great, I'm talking about the music. Sure, there are nice tracks throughout the series, some are beautiful, others I could somewhat jam to. But when I think that you've played that same stupid ""OMG SUSPENSE SH*T IS HAPPENING"" track for the hundredth time, I feel like face-desking. So many tracks are overly repeated to the point where you feel like you could play them if someone gave you the instrument they were playing the music with somewhat mediocrity. I'm also including OPs and EDs. A lot of the openings and endings sound great, like ""Cascade"" and ""FLAME"" Others sound, well, annoying, overly produced, and bleh. BLEH. Like the sh*tfest which is ""Totsugeki Rock"". Just, ewwww. Characters: 7 The characters in this show are nice. Sure, some of them are kinda tropey, but most them have something unique. Naruto seems to go through lots of pressure, CAUSE GUESS WHAT? OP PEOPLE WANNA MURDER YA! So he gets to experience and grow through that. Sakura is still romanticizing with hopes of being with Sasuke, and I can be harsh here, but I can't. I'm a hopeless romantic too. *sigh* She is tough though, and doesn't take no sh*t. Sai is shown to have had a bond with a person who was like a brother to him, and they then had to fight to the death, (**** you Danzou) and it had feels. Sasuke is a stupid hormone controlled idiot who wants to destroy the thing his brother protected, and ""build a new nation"". Can I call him stupid again?The other characters are fine, but a lot of them you couldn't really feel for since you didn't know that much about them. Enjoyment: 5 FILLER. FILLER. FFFFFIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. I""M HERE WANTING TO SEE A NEW EPISODE OF CANON, I SAY, CANON SHIPPUDEN, AND PIERROT THROWS A ****ING FILLER EPISODE OUT. AND IT""S AT SUCH UNNECESSARY MOMENTS TOO, LIKE A BATTLE JUST ENDED, EMOTIONAL SH*T HAPPENED, AND YOU THEN GET FILLER, YOU THEN FORGET WHAT HAPPENED TWO TO THREE WEEKS AGO, AND YOU DON'T GET THE SAME EXPERIENCE BECAUSE HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF WHAT THE **** HAPPENED, OR YOU JUST FORGET ENTIRELY IF THE FILLER RUNS FOR EIGHTY YEARS. AND SOMETIMES THE FILLER SOMEHOW CONNECTS TO THE MAIN STORY AND IT'S BULLSH*T. THE PEOPLE THAT CAN JUST BINGE THIS SHOW AND SKIP FILLERS I WISH I COULD PUNCH. *heavy breathing* The fights are nice as well, like GAI V MADARA. IT WASN'T WORTH THE WAIT, BUT IT WAS STILL AWESOME. Overall: 7 Shippuden is an average anime. It's ruined by filler that isn't even interesting or good in the first place, constant reused flashbacks that taint the whole entire series, and the animation at times can be atrocious. (See Pain V Naruto, or ALL THE STILL SHOTS EVER SEEN) The fights can be fun, emotional, or awesome. The main story is nice, but falters at times. The sound can be the most annoying thing of the show at times, but can also be charming or pleasant. This show has over 400 episodes. If you are a person who likes 13 episode anime, then this series is going to be tough on you. If you don't like shonen, then stay away. If you're expecting romance, there ain't a lot of it, I gotta tell ya. There's only around four major moments out of over 400 episodes. If you want awesome action stuff, then this show may fit to your tastes.",7,Recommended,"Aug 29, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a62b97338c,6,4691
"The number one knucklehead ninja is...still here! His training seemed to get him no where maturity wise or skill wise. He has used the same jutsu, the same yelling tactics to throw his enemy off(?) And the same &quot;I'm hokage&quot;, &quot;I'll save you!&quot;, or &quot;My childhood sucked!&quot; Lines. He hasn't grown or learned a thing. I would think he would stop endangering his team, being disrespectful to his senior officers, and trying to solo things rather than listening to the plans. When they were younger it was acceptable, it was even funny at times, but not now. Any scene with naruto I skip immediately. It is either screaming, crying, or &quot;kage bunshin no jutsu&quot;. Sakura and others are shown to have grown and learned many things through their training. Sakura has become way cooler than she ever was in Naruto, as well as tenten and others using newer styles of fighting from Naruto. I guess we will never see a change in the main character. I really did enjoy Naruto, but maybe I expected too much from Shippuden, or to much of a change maybe? Either way, I feel like now that they are older and with the main character still acting like this, makes the whole shinobi thing, along with all of the danger and life-threatening fighting look like a complete joke to the theme. As well as they are afraid of killing people off in my opinion, having them win against people who are said to be the greatest in the world. Making the characters older really did nothing, it is meant for the same audience that watched Naruto, and who didn't want any change or development. The story is pretty good though, I enjoy learning about the plot development as it goes by and want to see more about Akatsuki's plans. The story with sasuke and orochimaru is good also, as I feel it will all be tied together at some point in the anime and we should see some good fight scenes (I hope). That's about it, it's not that I hate it, but I was severely disappointed by it in a lot of ways.",7,Recommended,"Oct 20, 2007",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_cf46be2037,6,1997
"ROAD BLOCKS IN PLOT WRITING AND HOW TO OVERCOME THEM: SPECIAL ABRIDGED KISHIMOTO EDITION 1) I created a unique main character with a great ambition, how do I make this character instantly likable? Kishi says: I’ll let you in on a trade secret: “Tragic motherfuckin’ back-story.” You want your character’s childhood to be filled with angst, bullying, depression, thoughts of suicide, and maybe molestation (save this one for an easy shock reveal later on!). Remember, your character in present-day needs to be NOTHING like his childhood self for he will have overcome that shitty past with the almighty “STRONG RESOLUTION”. It’s all about the compare and contrast. “Good people deserve good futures”, readers love this. 2) Every protagonist needs an antagonist. What should a good antagonist be like? Kishi says: Polar opposite. A perfect antithesis of the main character. Have him bent onto a totally evil goal, like say... oh I donno... revenge? Also, make him sexy and make him mysterious. Chicks love that shit. And don’t you fucking forget about that tragic back-story! 3) Should my female characters be important and useful? Kishi says: No. --- Many pages of wisdom later --- 56) I have followed your sage advice. My protagonist has forgotten his original ambition and is now stricken with intense homolust for the antagonist. As per your suggestions, I have also went through many INTENSE training arcs: a new ability training arc, a training arc to prepare for a training arc, another new ability training arc, a timeskip training arc, a training arc after a training arc to control the new power gained from a previous training arc, and finally, super saiyan training on Namek. Kishi says: *wipes tear* This is beautiful. I couldn’t have done better myself. ---A few pages of growing regret later--- 72) Since that timeskip you recommended, I feel my protagonist has become severely overpowered, rendering everyone, but his lover, primitive in comparison. It seems that he has already long surpassed his original goal and achieving it now won’t amount to any sort of satisfaction. What hurts the most however, is seeing my fans clinging onto the hope that the plot would carry on, only to be repeatedly swindled with more pointless drivel. Should I bring my manga to a quick close with an epic fight against a greater evil? Kishi mutters: Don’t be asinine. Now is the perfect time for another flashback.

"I just want to start this review by saying that I love this series and I have my reasons, and while I will try to be as objective as possible, I am a fan (this should be known). Story: One of the benefits of such a long story like Naruto is that it truly feels epic. When you finish the series, you feel like you have been through it all with these characters. The story is character-driven as you see our main protagonist, Naruto, and the difficult journey that he experiences throughout his life. This series is quite a bit darker than the original and very mature. This works in this series benefit as its a seriousness that is needed for many of the key moments in the show. It spans through various story arcs that will always have there fair share of intense and ""edge of your seat"" moments. I want to note that there are many times where you will find yourself freaking out due to a particular storyline or amazing moment. Art: This is my lowest grade as the animation can be all over the place. However when it really counts, this series knocks it out of the park with its animation. Some important episodes in the story will literally look like series of high-quality desktop wallpapers flashing in front of your face (no joke, it looks that good sometimes). The fight scenes in this show are probably among the very best anime has to offer. They are visual spectacles and fights with key villains are a whole other level of amazing. It can look slightly weird at times but nothing that will stop you from watching the show or lessen your enjoyment of what you are watching. Sound: The openings and endings are all incredible in their own right, with a wide span of music genres (rock songs to love songs). Some soundtracks like Konoha Peace and Experienced Many Battles will literally invigorate you with so much emotion (its crazy). I will say that not all the tracks are perfect but they do their job. Character: I can't even describe how good the characters are in Naruto because you just have to see for yourself. I think you can attribute this to how good the Chunin Exam arch was in the original Naruto, but in this series they are just more fleshed out and deepened. You will literally see characters that you may hate at first but end up loving a couple episodes later. The main character, Naruto, is extremely well done and you can't help but like him. The other main character, Sasuke, is equally well-written. The rivalry between the two characters is really something that this series nailed. Enjoyment: This review really can't do this show justice or express my love for the series as a whole. There is a reason Naruto is as popular as it is, and its because it has touched so many people around the world. While there were some bumps along the way, it was worth it.

"I've been watching Naruto for a very long time. I've read the entire Manga and completed Naruto (Part 1) I've also seen a few of the movies and all the ova's and specials. The story is utter garbage. It's dragged out and supplemented with horribly written filler arcs. The pacing is painfully slow and unnecessary. The battles are relatively interesting but there is too much needless talk and deliberation. The art/animation is inconsistent and changes from episode to episode. It's usually very poorly done and while this might be good for saving money and time. Naruto is one of the most heavily marketed Anime in the world, it should have enough funds to pay for decent Animation. The characters are the best thing about this series. My personal favourites being Madara, Sasuke, Itachi, Orochimaru, Naruto, Kakashi, Hinata and Jiraiya. These characters are pretty deep and deal with their own struggles. The sound is pretty good. Good OP and ED's. It's enjoyable to watch but people need to stop rating it so highly. It's not a masterpiece, it's not perfect and it's pretty damn overrated but it does provide me with lots of entertainment and I'm still watching after 399 episodes...

"Naruto Shippuuden is like Star Wars the Disney Sequels - a whole lot of retconning, fan service and bull crap. It's one of those anime continuations or endings that were better off not happening at all. The problem is the story, not the anime, the animation quality or manga, the story is the main culprit. As it continues off from how Naruto ended, the story starts off full of hope, energy, a lot of new adventures, but just like One Piece Post Time Skip, it just should have not existed at all. Just to see the story ending and the price being the whole story turn into garbage is a price way too high for anyone to pay. The way the story goes in Shippuuden and how it is explained the origin of Ninjutsu is also too far-fetched and not a satisfying conclusion. There is a lot of going back and forth in the series, a lot of nothing happening for hundreds of episodes, meaning literally years passing with nothing of significance happening. Then there are a lot of useless side-characters from other ninja villages being introduced, each one gets their own flashback to explain their motivation, again wasting at least 30-40 episodes for absolutely no reason. A lot of the time is Naruto acting all strong and mature and Sasuke playing emo once again with some new followers buying his crap. At the end there is a great culmination, combined with dead characters being brought to life and useless characters being killed off like Portgas D. Ace in One Piece just to create a fake feeling of how dark and serious stuff are (which isn't the case), then comes the ending filled with even more retconning and fan service and the series ends. I was glad when it ended, not because I was happy with how it ended, but with the fact that it's over, so I don't have to put up with this trash ever again. The original Naruto series is far superior and it should have never been continued into Shippuuden if it was going to be the garbage it was. This is further emphasized in the series Boruto, which is literally 70% fan service and 30% riding on the old story's fame hoping to keep this garbage afloat. After that I won't be surprised if there is a series about Boruto's grandchildren, and some people will even watch that too.",4,Not Recommended,"Apr 17, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8716e16ed9,6,2222
"First of all i would like to pin-point a few things.I have watched all the known mainstream animes that many of us used to watch all these years. Bleach -One piece-Fairy tail( this is kinda a new one comparison to the others) and i must sayNaruto is by far the best on all its aspects. People hating this anime where they havent even watched it is wierd Story 10-----This is one of the deepest animes i have seen. There are about 50-60 characters in this anime that all have their own stories which drag-on and they have their on impact in the flow of the anime.Putting together a solid story with all these characters and the actual story of the anime is something beyond difficult. The clans, the villages, the bijuus, the skills, all the chakra explanation and the battle system.Naruto-Naruto Shippuuden its a world of its own running in a perfect flow. Who would epect Obito would be alive after the accident, a story that took palce like 500 episodes ago-Naruto shippuuden does that, its not like the other animes that every episode erases its past and starts a new story , its a well-built story with almost non-glitches Sound 10-- 10 is too litle for the most succesfull anime in terms of soundtracks and music. Yashuharu Takanashi has done it again(and Toshio Masuda of course) all the tracks are masterpieces, no wonder why some of the tracks are of world fame and used for other rasons aswell Art 9-- Very much improved from its prodeccor Naruto-not eprfect though Character 10---Who didint like that clumpsy loud voice kid at the first part of this anime...Naruto and the others have grown in Shippuuden but in a great way. Naruto has grown as much as he should be and changed as much as he should be.He is not a complitely different person neither the others, but they all have added new aspects i their characters matching the years difference from Naruto.

"My Thoughts on the Ending of Naruto First thing first. I will miss Naruto like no other. I first came into contact with Naruto way back in the 7th grade of middle school when it used to air in English on Toonami. It was love at first sight. The date was September 10th, 2005. I eagerly awaited each week for new episodes, and Naruto never disappointed, even on its worst episode. Fast forward 9 years later, and I'm still eagerly awaiting each new episode every week, even though I have already finished the events of the manga. Critics of Naruto say that the anime/ manga has gone on for way too long and that it should have ended earlier; it's no longer good. I can't deny that Naruto has a ton of plot holes, but even so, the author has given me something to consistently look forward to for 9 years. How many anime series can you say have done something like that for you? Moreover, my interest in Naruto is not solely tied to the plot. To this day, I've bought 12 Naruto games and counting. I love the Naruto universe. I love the characters. I love the powers. I love the action. I love the voice actors. All of the Naruto games I own do an amazing job at recreating the characters from the series and letting you feel as though you are the character. When I choose Sasuke in the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, I feel like I become Sasuke. All of his powers from the show, I can command at the tips of my fingers. I'm the one using the Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu, and I'm the one unleashing Susanoo. As a result, the joy I get from being my favorite characters in these games heightens the amount of pleasure I take away from the series itself. It's been a couple weeks since Naruto ended, and it's still hard to believe it's over. When I read the final chapter, I honestly didn't want to turn the pages. Seeing all of the characters that started off at 12 years old become adults, get married, and have kids, really got believing that it is in fact over--the end of a generation. I was 12 years old myself when I began watching Naruto, now I'm 21. In a way, I feel as though I've grown up with these characters and that my youth is also approaching it's end soon. In the coming years, I'm not sure if I will ever experience an anime that has done what Naruto has done for me ever again. I'm really sad that my journey with Naruto is rapidly approaching it's end, but I'm also thankful for these past 9 years.

"So now that the manga has ended its serialization and the anime still continues to spew endless filler for no reason other than to milk as much money as possible, I am writing a review to explain to you why Naruto: Shippuden was a promising anime that went downhill since the first episode. The story of Naruto is an interesting and unique one. Its something that hasn't been told too often and it has a great setting. But the anime does a very poor job of executing it. There are a few canon episodes, then a plethora of fillers appear out of nowhere, so that when the canon story continues from where it left off, I have somewhat lost my hype on what was happening before the filler. This is even more prominent towards the end of the series, which is where there's supposed to be excitement above all else. The fillers themselves are so bad they ruin the characters' personalities to some extent.The canon episodes are dragged on by the same flashbacks so many times you'll start feeling sleepy. The characters' backstories, especially Naruto's, are shown so many times, you won't even feel sentimental anymore. There were some great story arcs like the Pain arc, but the rest all drag on and on. Speaking of characters, Naruto has some of the best characters in anime, hands down. Protagonists like Naruto, Shikamaru, Kiba etc and antagonists like Itachi, Nagato, Madara are some of the best ever in anime history. But I feel that as the series progresses, the series starts focusing too much on Naruto and Sasuke and leaves out interesting supporting characters. Even the notoriously bad guys are somehow turned into good guys through some bullshit backstory so that they MUST turn good before they die, even evil-F*CKING-Madara. so the series kinda ruins the characters it brought up, though I wouldn't say they are bad. The animation too goes downhill since the beginning, and this is one of the worst aspects of the show. Too many still images, too many flashbacks, too long recaps are all there to increase the runtimes and save up some budget. There were some arcs that were decently animated, but others are sloppy and still to the point I sometimes thought my computer froze. The soundtrack has a great Ninja-esque felling to it, and it unique and in most instances, pretty catchy. Most of the opening songs are great while the endings are average (I guess).

"Naruto returns completely different, yet unchanged; yaoi fangirls, filler, and cliche friendship speeches still ruin it for the most part. Shippuuden and the original naruto are by far the most overrated anime since Gundam Wing. I read the manga up to where it is now, and I can see how it got there, but how the anime maintains fans still amazes me. The fans are classified as ""Narutards"" to the public, due to its overwhelming popularity. They provide 20 or 40 episodes of filler after 20 slow plot episodes, and it's just not funny at this point. I already stopped watching it an entirely moved back to the manga. The manga still manages to keep me interested, but the anime is dead to me. I loved shippuuden until the filler started getting ridiculous. I don't know what those guys in the anime industry are doing, but it's screwed up how they love to send their ratings plummeting into the ground so often. Originally, Shippuuden was an anime that had everything; tons of suspense, meaningful death scenes, and touching moments, but now it's just another anime about some grown man that acts like a kid chasing after a homicidal maniac that used to be a ""Friend"" of his. Do I need to say anything else to get the point across that shipuuden is only good for so long?",7,Recommended,"Jul 28, 2010",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_b387b8d2ab,6,1271
"A good anime, like any piece of art, isn't judged only by it's art style, characters and story. It also heavily relies on the production, fan base and various other factors. While this anime started out well enough it had completely degraded itself with almost 45% of the episodes being fillers. As a fan I get totally engrossed in the plot and when the production decides to milk the fans for more views this becomes a stab in the back of dedicated viewers. For 10 years I've watched this anime and at long last after all said and done all I can say about Naruto (and derivatives) is that it is garbage. Never waste your life on this show. You are too good of a human to be marred by this disdainful time sink.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 17, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4b52d830b5,6,711
"Review for both Shippuden and the Original Naruto. Naruto is... a journey. I remember back in my earlier years of school watching the show late at night was kind of ritualistic for me (together with Shaman King). Now, me being a year away from graduating high school and the show airing for 14 years coming to a close earlier this year, I decided to watch the last 100 or so episodes after taking a long break from anime to put and end to a part of my childhood. Man, did I miss out. The anime itself, through time, grew and changed, just like everyone that watched it since the beginning. It started off as a silly-headed shounen about ninjas and super powers and ended with the main characters aiming to save the world from devastation. Story-wise, Naruto goes through hardships, endures pain, learns from his mistakes and tests his strength against many foes, but ultimately the final showdown is between him and his first rival, which proves that the show didn't lose focus throughout the years and finished on the note that Kishimoto wanted to (brilliant on his part). While the artstyle is unique and easily-recognizable even for non-anime viewers, quality really drops at time, most evident in the filler episodes, which I'll talk about later on. Music is really well put all-around, it makes you pumped when there's an action scene coming up, makes you emotional when something sad happens and makes you literally laugh out loud when needed. Something that strikes me as surprising is how well-developed is the supporting staff. Most of them are filled with personality and distinguishable, likable design. For every arc focused on Naruto, there are a couple focused on his friends that help him through his path, which leads me to my next point. Naruto's motto, ninja way or nindō or whatever you want to call it, is that of never running away or going back on his word, which really speaks about the show itself and the lesson it wants to teach. As the already mentioned hardships suggest, Naruto never altered his vision or casted aside someone else's feeling or dreams, showing that there is always a reason to try your hardest and be righteous. Not everything is without its mistakes, though. The only gut-wrenching flaw about the series is how. many. god. damn. filler. episodes. there. are. They make up about half of the episodes, while most of the provide little to no content. To cut some slack off, some of the arcs are pretty amusing by themselves and deserve a watch. Overall, the anime is great, it certainly has a special place in my heart, even if I won't revisit it sheerly because of volume. As undoubtedly one of the most memorable long-running anime out there, it surely is a thing to relish if not for the entertainment it brings, but for the millions of people that it inspired, just like dragon ball did to the previous generation. Now the baton is passed to his son, Boruto, and only time will tell if he'll make his dad proud.",9,Recommended,"Aug 29, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_dde0008a59,6,2959
"Naruto is more than just a long-running shonen anime. It’s a cultural milestone. At its heart lies the story of a lonely boy who dreams of being acknowledged, fighting against prejudice, loss, and rejection. Through Naruto Uzumaki’s journey from outcast to hero, the series explores powerful themes of perseverance, identity, the importance of bonds, and the pain of growing up in a broken world. One of Naruto’s greatest strengths is its emotional storytelling. It doesn’t shy away from heavy topics like trauma, war, and sacrifice. Even minor characters are given meaningful backstories that deepen the narrative and evoke empathy. The arcs vary greatly in tone and scope. From light-hearted village missions to large-scale wars. While the pacing can be inconsistent, the emotional payoff often makes the buildup worth it. The animation, especially in Shippuden, fluctuates across episodes due to the sheer number of them, but it shines in key battles like Naruto vs. Pain, Kakashi vs. Obito, and the final fight between Naruto and Sasuke. Visually, the series matures over time, with Shippuden showcasing sharper art direction and more dynamic choreography. The soundtrack is equally iconic, enhancing both somber and uplifting moments with tracks that linger long after an episode ends. Beyond its action, Naruto offers introspection and hope. It reminds us that people can change, that pain can heal, and that connections with others can redefine our fate. The worldbuilding is another major strength. Rich with lore, diverse clans, complex ideologies, and a power system (chakra, jutsu, kekkei genkai) that offers both spectacle and strategy. The voice acting, both in sub and dub, deserves praise. From Naruto’s raw, emotional outbursts to Itachi’s chilling calm, the performances breathe life into the characters and their struggles. While the high filler count and a few overly drawn-out arcs, particularly near the end of Shippuden are valid criticisms, many fans agree that the emotional weight of the journey outweighs its structural flaws. Despite its length, many arcs retain rewatch value due to their iconic confrontations and heartfelt moments. Even if you know what’s coming, Naruto still hits, sometimes even harder the second time. Naruto is a grand journey that leaves a mark, not just because of where it ends, but because of everything it fights through along the way.",10,Recommended,"Jul 19, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9c54564f07,6,2391
"First off all, I just wanna say that I am super sad that this show has come to an end. I personally tried to watch as slow as possible because I wasn't felt ready to finish it. It is my comfort anime that I watched when I felt myself empty. I fell in love with the emotions, art style and characters in the anime.

"Probably one of my favorite anime of all time. This anime is a really popular anime and even though there are a lot of fillers, I really enjoy it. The sad stories in Naruto always make me cry and there are lots of hilarious moments. In addition, this is one of the few anime where the English dub does not tick me off. As viewers we are able to see Naruto's growth as a character from an immature brat to someone who can truly understand the pains of mankind.

Just like most of the people I know I also started watching anime from Naruto.. it is the best anime I ever seen.. best story.. best characters.. It's just perfect but the thing that bother me so much are the filler episodes.. I think no one is interested in fillers. They r ruining the whole anime by adding fillers.. for example in recent episodes (394 to onwards) what was the logic in showing chunin exams when both Naruto and Sasuke r dead?? They were not even in the chunin exams... Fillers r destroying this best anime.,8,Recommended,"Feb 13, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_30ebc5a7d7,6,526
"I'm sorry.. it's just so bad in my opinion of course. The art is dumbed down from the original series, the sound is... pretty much the same stuff. The character development for the new characters is pretty good... Enjoyment.. is bad because.. well... FILLERS... EVERYWHERE... it tries making you bored out of your mind or on the edge of your seat so even the most pointless event seem exciting. It's dragged out so long. I believe it should only be around 50-100 episodes. I quit watching the original Naruto at like 80 then started watching Shippuuden because my friend really likes it, but we literally skimmed through the first 40 episodes within about 2 hours, and I did not miss any details at all. I discussed the main bad points about Naruto with my friend and he agreed with all of them which include the ones that I have talked about before. They're overcomplicating it in my opinion, and should stay focused on the main problem, create ""sub""-problems that lead up to ending the main conflict, which seem to be the problem with a lot of mainstream shounen anime. They try making a series as long as possible to make the most money out of it rather then creating a good story, with good art, and characters that a person will thoroughly enjoy. Overall, Naruto Shippuuden gets a 5/10, There are a lot of shorter anime series that gets to the point of the anime which are much more exciting, because they cram all their interesting ideas into a short time span rather than having a single event drag out over a term of 3-10 episodes.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 21, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9ec65bd00b,6,1539
"F****** S Tier anime. I don't have to say anything else or explain myself. The War arc and the Pain Assault arc were some of the best arcs I've ever seen in anime. Although, I don't really like the last ending of the War arc, kinda like the Espada Arc in Bleach, I love the arc, but I don't like the ending. It started off with a bang, although, the Kazekage Rescue arc was pretty slow, it hurt me so ending hurt me so hard, I was balling.

"Regarded as one of the world’s most popular and long-standing animations, Naruto has undoubtedly crafted a shinobi universe that is intriguing for anime viewers. The styles of different clans, the movement of each jutsu, the history of each nations, all of them are well-choreographed and deserve a big applause. The foreshadowing is brilliant and what amazes me is that they always succeed in keeping the mystery going until the “real” truth is unveiled, such as the Itachi/Sasuke arc and Madara/Tobi arc. Why Naruto as a character Ruins it for me: The downside is, while there is an amazing array of characters on the show (i.e. Rock Lee, Gaara, Shino, Iruka), the show solely puts its spotlight on Naruto - which is a shame. The author made no effort to give other characters a chance to shine and that leaves the show rather dull and one-dimensional. Characters like Tenten, Ino and Kurenai are merely females to waste away in the background. My least favourite part is Naruto Uzumaki, who has continued to be one of the most unconvincing and quite frankly, an annoying and obnoxious character. His positivity gradually becomes a massive turn-off in the show. When it progresses to a point where everyone just blindly praises whatever comes out of Naruto’s mouth, you just can’t help but roll your eyes. It’s so far-fetched that it’s just absolutely bonkers! There is a fine line between a motivational speaker that is full of utter gibberish and a good inspiring character that doesn’t overcompensate, and here is where Naruto fails to do for me. Everytime he speaks, I would just happily mute the thing. :) One of the wasted potentials in the show is characters like Rock Lee, who works his way up against all odds and no ninjutsu talent. With his humble (and much more likable) attitude, I can see how this underdog could potentially turn the table at the end. Still, the show never shows mercy to any character other than Naruto. Most of the time, everyone is just there fighting until they are saved and rescued by the all-mighty Naruto and his “genuinity”. For once, I would just like to see other capable characters to shine in their own ninja way, instead of making the Naruto way the only way. Last but not least, the amount of filler and recap is frustrating. You spend 20 minutes watching a full episode and only ¼ of it is new. What a drag. As someone who started out as a huge fan watching, and having a completely different opinion towards the end, I am to say the least disappointed. On the other hand, I would recommend its two spin-offs, Uchiha Sasuke no Sharingan Den (manga) and Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals (anime and manga), which are very well-written and hit all the right notes if you’re down for some lovely wholesome humour.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 22, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_af69bc0e19,14,2753
"As one of the best known works of all time. Naruto has one of the biggest fanbases and is certainly one of the biggest animes in the world. I loved it as a child, it was my favorite anime with Dragon Ball. But for a criticism, I have to be a critic, with countless fillers and holes in the story, Kishimoto didn't know how to manage such a large work. His last arc as an ending took so long, that I broke my fingers from skipping the filler episode so much. In the middle of a war, putting filler is nothing, with Naruto doing shit I don't like in the anime. Whoever watches the complete anime after being old, realizes how badly managed the work was. An anime that I consider and a lot, but the only way to find this anime perfect, is either not understanding anything, or is to love blindly. For consideration, I leave a note of 5. History and development 2. Because in Shippuden the only thing I heard was Naruto and Sasuke, they shit for the other characters; An anime that doesn't develop the other characters, for me, loses half the note.

Naruto shippuden is so beautiful to me, it makes me cry, laugh, and feel inspired. YES, this show is pretty kick ass with ninjas but this show can be sad at times. This show has alot of meaning. Story- it begins with 3 main story's and they are all carried out through the series. The show makes sure to explain everything so your not lost. Everything seems to be connected to each story, so it's not like the story's is nonsense and irreverent. Everything links up so good. Sound- Naruto shippuden has an awesome OST soundtrack. Songs match up with the characters and situations emotions. Intro songs are so good that I download some to my phone. They always switch up the music so you get to listen and find new songs. Charterers- each character has a story, and these story's are fill with such meaning. Each character will teach you a meaning or even a lesson. Charterers are all different with their own personality's. These characters have special bonds with each other and you can actually grasp onto those bonds and relationships.

Meanwhile (In shippuden) a group called the akatsuki come in and basically start up a war. Also Naruto is also training his hardest so he can ""rescue"" his friend Sauske. Sorry for the crappy summery and yes I know theres already a summery. Anyway so I can understand why Naruto is so determined to be Hokage but at least every couple episode the creators always make sure to stick it in your face ""Naruto was a loser"". But my biggest pet peeve about the show, the thing I just cannot stand (thats not fillers) Is sauske. Why would you try and save a friend who doesn't even need saving? I found it just pointless If Sauske wanted to come back to the hidden leaf, he can do it on his own. Art & Sound: Honestly I loved the voices of every character and the art style was pretty good too. I have no complaints here Characters: Alright so we got Loveable yet annoying Naruto Believe it then we got useless and lets face it desperate sakura, we got ""Cool guy"" and sometimes a jerk Sauske. We got extremely loveable kakashi. And thats about it Enjoyment: Despite everything I've said, I loved Naruto. it was a nice anime.

"Naruto is a long drawn out tale full of adventure and an enormous set of characters. The show has its goods and its bads, unfortunately the bads outweigh the good.. greatly, but even then it does serve its purpose in the anime world. Naruto at its core is a pretty bland show. It came about to bank on the power trip stories that came out of Dragon Ball Z. Bleach, One piece are all reminiscent of what Dragon Ball Z was. A guy overcoming unrealistic challenges to attain his goal, they are always invincible, any damage is always fixable, in any encounter you KNOW they will come out on top because that is how the show runs. It is a predictable heap of shit. Banking on the DBZ sentiment is not bad though, look at Avatar, it is not an anime but it is inspired by anime. Avatar does something all those shonen fail at, Avatar knows what it is and it does not choke on itself. Naruto and majority of other shonen try really hard to be mature and deep. The problem with this is that what they deem to be deep and mature are really not it. Avatar knows it is for kids, it isn't a try hard show biting more than it can chew. You want gritty and deep and mature go somewhere else. You want a show pretending to be mature and act tough like a 16 year old teen then this is it. I mentioned the show has its place. That is correct, it has a place among the younger audience and it is expected that as you grow older you get tired of this shit and grow the fuck up. Don't be one of those 20-30 year old youtubers commenting every week on the new episode release of naruto, it is really sad. So in the end I'll say this: Watch Naruto, watch it alot, have your fill. Use it to refine your taste and branch off from there to anime that is less shit. story: 3 pretty shit story, this story has been done a number of times, watch something else. It is repetitive and gives a rosy false view to kids. FRIENDSHIP WON""T PAY YOUR BILLS OR GET YOU INTO SCHOOL, IT WON'T BRING YOU BACK FROM THE DEAD. We get it naruto, you love your friends, please calm the fuck down. In life people come and go, no one is here to stay and eventually we all will die. we all have our reasons for hating someone or for being bad to someone, sasuke did too and no amount of beating him to death will make him good. GIVE THE KID SOME COUNSELING HIS FAMILY DIED. If anything Naruto teaches kids to beat their friends up in frustration for not having the same opinion, instead of sitting with them and asking how they feel.

"This series is a spectacle in the shounen genre. Let us not mince words!! This show succeeds in utilizing its cast of secondary characters due to a long episode count and filler episode budget that the animation studio has. Battle sequences are epic where new abilities need to be learned for our main character to keep up with the looming threats wanting to destroy the shinobi world. The villains in Naruto are very fleshed out. Naruto Shippuuden gets you invested in the main characters and rooting for them quickly into the first Akatsuki onslaught. The filler episodes fall into the ""hit-or-miss"" category, so if you are watching for the story or over-the-top shounen fights, you might wanna have a list of filler episodes ready so that you can accelerate thru the long episode count.

"Let me start this review by saying I've seen every episode that has been aired for both Naruto (completed) and Naruto Shippuden (currently) and yes that also includes fillers. *Now I understand that not everyone is going to have the same opinion as me but the entire Naruto franchise will always have a dear place in my heart and here's why: Story: The story line for Naruto Shippuden is a lot different from Naruto, but it is equally great. Once you get past the infinite amount of filler, or decide to skip them, it is clear that although Sasuke's retrieval makes up most of the adventures, there is just SO MUCH MORE to follow along with. Naruto Shippuden can have you crying, laughing, stressed and angry all in the course of one episode. Characters: My oh my how they have changed. All of the characters have grown so much and even Kiba is likable haha. Here are two examples: Naruto came back a whole new person. Literally. His outfit is upgraded, his maturity has somewhat increased, and so has his height ;) Sakura: one of my favorite characters is clearly no longer ""useless"".

The reason: Way too many many many fillers, plus the way that Sasuke guys suck lemons with his arrogant attitude and demeanor, and how Naruto won't just give up the prick. This turned this anime I really liked into something unwatchable in only 95 episodes. I lost my patience when they came up with that Doton/Crystal element arc. I mean, fillers are fillers, but Shipuuden's are hard to get through, they're too bad to watch from start to finish.

Up until the Pain arc ended the show was great (I would of gave a 8 overall) except for boring filler episodes, but once the Konoha past filler ended it went straight down hill. It started becoming some bad emotional drama. Every second a flashback would occur showing some scene involving Naruto and Sasuke playing the SAME song every time. I mean 2 non-filler episodes were literally 18 minutes of flashbacks showing the same flashbacks they played the last 10 episodes. I can't stand the silly plot anymore and if flashbacks are not happening it's the same thing reoccurring.

"this will be short and sweet. I don't write reviews but naruto having so many 10's really gets to me. The overlaying story is very well done(for the most part). the art, i like(unlike some younger people used to way different quality). Sound is on point. Unique and impactful. That being said, everything else about the show is mediocre at best. The characters advance, but done actually DEVELOP, with the exception of naruto and sasuke(i'll give you shikimaru as well i suppose). Sakura learns to fight, and then barely does. everyone else has basically a static personality that may change a little bit, but then goes back to as it was. This show, along with bleach, are what i call failed potential. Great premises, could go so far, but seems to fall short due to filler and mediocre character development. I will say the show is enjoyable, but come prepared with a filler guide and if your anything like me, u can watch naruto and around 100 episodes of shippuden before you feel it's worth watching. as for me it was the first death involving an akatsuki attack(if you've watched, you know who) that finally made the show seem to have some form of realism and depth and frankly it shouldnt have taken that long. If a 12 episode anime with a crappy story can make me cry, why did it 300+ for shippuden to illicit a similar response?

"Just over one year after starting the original Naruto series, I have gotten through all 770 episodes. Although I did not get to experience it in the way many others did by growing up with it through the many years of its airing, in a way I lucked out because I did not have to spend months watching weekly fillers. I personally believe reviews/ratings by people who watch a show later after it has aired are a lot more reliable than ones that are given immediately after a show finishes airing. Peoples expectations and bias towards a show often cloud the reliability of a seasonal show's rating, especially when its a preliminary rating (no idea why people rate shows before completing them). But thats beside the point. Naruto is arguable one of the most entertaining series not just in anime, but in entertainment ever. Its ability to captivate an audience and blow them away was put on display numerous times. Whether it was the opening arc of the Land of Waves, the Chunin Exam, or Pains Arc, it told its story in such an interesting and fun way. Even though Naruto isnt exactly known for its complex plot or characters, theres really no anime that comes close to it in excitement. Fillers suck, yea we get it, try to go a day without complaining about the Naruto fillers challenge (most of you would fail). Naruto Shippuden has some quality filler arcs compared to the original series, particularly towards the last half of the show. Great filler arcs that come to mind are the Kakashi, Itachi, and Kaguya background ones. If people would look at filler as extra content instead of waste of time, then they would be able to enjoy it a lot more. Its like DLC!!! Damn... the characters in Naruto Shippuden... are something else. Pretty much every main Uchiha character is awesome, along with Team 7, the Kage, and some of the Konan kids. Naruto's character is the highlight of well, the Naruto series. His character isnt exactly complex. He doesnt go through much character ""development"" per say. But watching his story, and his dream, play out its hard to put into words the feelings you get from that. Hes such a bright, uplifting character and it makes viewers so happy to see everyone around him not only acknowledge him, but follow behind him as their leader. Focusing on the bright side of an anime series is what people in this community should always do. You can critique Naruto for its many filler arcs, or for not putting lots of effort into animation. But the show is still the most popular and impactful anime of all time for a reason. It has that IT factor that makes people of all ages want to watch it.

"Naruto shippuden or called filleruto, was great at the start, then fillers ruined it like crazzy!!! the arc now has been going on since 2013, and the latest 20 episodes have all been fillers, i dont understand whats going on? oh well, shippuden takes place 3 years after the first naruto anime, everyone you saw in the original anime has grown up, the characters in the start are really not that great, exept the main enemy group, later characters become better but are still one dimentional, like the animation, shippuden it feels like have gone threw so many diffrent animations, sometimes it looks good, sometimes awfull, right now its fair, one fight scene with naruto and a main enemy has the aboslute worst animation i have ever seen in an anime, i mean wtf. Sound is really good tho and it has great intros and outros, naruto tho is the most typical shounen there is so dont expect, one punch man animation or , death note storytelling! The characters that are good are really good! like itachi uchia, sasuke uchia, naruto altho he can be annyoing sometimes, and the enemys in the hole show are some of the best ive seen in an shounene anime, overall 9/10 without fillers, but now its filleruto so 7/10",7,Recommended,"Dec 18, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_455775fb9b,14,1209
"I said I was gonna go to bed but I lied.....I'm not gonna write much as I know some people have a serious problem with naruto and I can totally understand why. Instead of grading Naruto Im gonna just do The good, The bad, and The Ugly. ""Your doing something different? Thats so stupid and wiierd. Why would you do that?"" It's simpler, faster, easier, and because f**k you, thats why. THE GOOD: Story has a very fun and interesting premise with tons of action, superpowers, ninjas, respect, badass fight and much more. The story is so long and complex it really has some great plot twists that are a pleasure to watch even if you know it's going to happen 50 episodes before it happens (because most of us read the manga). The characters are awesome and you become attached to them the more you watch. They all have flaws, they all have personality, and they all have history. It all ties together quite nicely over the years since this anime began. THE BAD: This is strictly my opinion so feel free to completely disregard this section and go onto the next because I know for a fact that alot of people will not agree with what Im about to say. It didnt have enough romance, there I said it. I think there could have been a few places where romance could have boosted this anime up to around an 8.4ish score. Once again I dont expect people to agree with this so please disregard this section if you disagree. I would actually appreciate a personal message telling me what you think about this whether its good or bad. Im very interested on what you guys have to say about this topic and upcoming movie. Anyway, moving on. THE UGLY: Im pretty sure you all know what I'm goin to say...and yes you are right....FILLERS. Now dont get me wrong. I grew up with Naruto starting in 5th grade and this show holds a special place in my heart. But I gotta say, there is nothing worst then a very important climax or battle arc getting interrupted by a stupid filler. It can be a complete turn off. Are some of them fun to go back and watch? yes! of course! but the timing of them is horribly off in my opinion and they can get lengthy and as you watch more of them you start getting angry and frustrated. ""this is pointless"" probably describes the feeling best to some of you. THE OVERALL: 9 in my personal enjoyment, 8 in terms of quality overall (as a critic) I have been watching for so many years now so it is really hard for me to critique this fairly. I hope for the most part you guys understand where Im coming from. Overall this anime is a great watch. Probably will be a classic when its all over, but that will be along time from now. Im extremely jealous of anyone just starting the series now because you get to skip all those fillers. But yeah, please watch it, it only gets better as you watch and the more you watch the more you wont be able to stop. Most deadly jutsu? Flashback no Justu hands-down. This jutsu can easily can rip anyones mind to shreds, destroy someones sanity, or worse.....make them turn off the computer/TV in a matter of seconds :0 .....deadly",8,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a1236f010b,14,3071
"Ok to start with naruto this is one of the first anime that i had ever watched when i was a kid. Naruto is the type of anime that has good character storiesx due to its long run and has a decent story in which usually doesnt stale in my eyes atleast. I really enjoy naruto definetly one of favorites but it does have alot of flaws. First of all the art style tends to change just recently in the story the art style changed from what it was before its not a big change but its still there. Second HUGE flaw about this series is the constant filler in this anime we will get around 3 episodes of cannon and then get thrown into flashbacks and even sometimes it will takes months off of the story to show us a full filler arc and the amount that it happens makes watching very boring but they do make up for it when the story usually resumes. Another thing that can sometimes be wierd is the animation it can be good and it can also be at a stand still and just freeze at times. In my opinion Naruto is a good show to watch its a 10/10 in my book just because of my connection but for the average person a good 8/10 sounds about right give it a watch if you like long running shows.

"I'll be honest: I didn't like Naruto that much. Now before you think I've gone nuts, hear me out. I liked the premise of the story and I enjoyed the beginning of the series quite a lot as well. The sound track is pretty nice, albeit a little dramatic at times and I liked the animation. I liked most of the characters, even. But there were a few things that really killed the series for me. One issue was that there were way too many fillers. Even die-hard Naruto fans will agree with me on this. There were so many just useless episodes about random missions or life at Konoha or whatever, that I started to get sick of watching. Some of them were nice, I'll admit, but most of them added basically nothing to the story line and got on my nerves. Out of the 500 episodes of Naruto, at least 100 are fillers and for me, that is just waaay too many. There was also an issue of a few plot holes and good ideas that were not revisited at all, which got me mildly to thoroughly irritated from time to time based on how interested I was in the idea. But in the long run, I don't think that problem alone would have made me dislike the series as much as I do. This next one is kind of personal preference. Although Naruto doesn't have a bunch of blatant fan service or girls in bikinis and whatnot. I eventually got sick of the fact that almost every new female character was introduced with an obligatory butt shot or boob shot. For some of them it was more odd and out-of-place than the others, but overall I'd say that the idea just kind of got old. Fan service in general isn't really my thing, but I don't mind it that much if it doesn't become a central part of the story. Once again, however, this is just personal preference, so if you like fan service or don't find butt/boob shots boring, this won't bother you at all. But the biggest issue I had was the Sharingan (an eye that grants the user access to special techniques). In the beginning, I really liked the idea of an eye that can copy other jutsu (ninja techniques that are somewhat like magic, but marginally explained) instantaneously. It was an interesting idea and I looked forward to its uses and how it would be developed. I expected there to be some kind of upgrade to it. So when Itachi (one of the characters) showed up with a Mangekyo Sharingan that was very useful to for genjustu (marginally explained mind control), I accepted it. I didn't really get how someone could get from a copying eye to any eye that can hypnotize people, but I just kind of shrugged and went with it. But when Sasuke (one of the main characters) and Itachi started to yank literal skeleton monsters out of their eyeballs, I got super irritated. Explain to me how in the world we got from a copying eye to an eye that has enough room to fit a skeleton. At this point the writer was blatantly just adding complete bs to the Sharingan in order to make Sasuke look more ""badass"". Sure, it made him look marginally more competent, but to me, it was just irritating. It made no sense in any way, shape, or form and was just a major plot hole and turnoff. The final nail in the coffin was when a villain with the Sharingan showed up with a dimension in his eyeball. How? Just how? You're really telling me that there is now a special dimension accessible to Sharingan users that no one had any prior knowledge/ idea about? What does the main ability of the Sharingan, the copy cat eye, have to do with pulling dimensions out of thin air? It was like the writer was trying to see how far he could go with just random, unexplained power ups to the Sharingan. It was infuriating, stupid, and I lost what little respect and awe I had for the Sharingan I had with this ""new ability"". The entire constant evolution issue with the Sharingan was even further offset and outlined by the Byakagan (another eye that gives the person access to special justu). The Byakagan was established as very strong and blatantly more powerful than the Sharingan at the beginning of the series. So when I noticed that the Sharingan was turning into some kind of a monster, God-like eye, I expected some sort of special Byakagan to form. But the Byakagan stayed completely the same from episode 1 to episode 500. If you're going to power up one eye so much, at least stay consist and do something to the other one! Overall, some parts of the story were done really well. Some aspects of the plot and some of the messages wrapped up in this story are good. But some things in the story just completely killed it for me and even though I watched the entire series, I kind of wish I had just dropped it once the problems became too much for me to handle. Even so, a lot of people like Naruto and there is nothing wrong with that. I just listed what issues made Naruto a no-go for me. So if you have read the plot summary and don't have any issues with the problems I outlined above, go for it! Hopefully you will enjoy Naruto more that I did.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 18, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_522275399b,14,4955
"Anime with the best ninja story concept ever. I watched Naruto anime since I was in junior high school. This anime is very popular in Indonesia. All anime lovers in Indonesia, must know about Naruto. An anime about epic ninja fights, and entertaining ninja adventures, as well as a harsh ninja world. An anime that tells about Uzumaki Natuto, who wants to become Hokage, and become a great ninja, who is relied on by many people. This anime is good, but there are things I don't like. Too many non-canon filler stories, and too many flashbacks, which doesn't really matter.",8,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a0de523d9b,14,573
"Hmmm what can I say about Naruto? Well, for having a total of 500 epsidoes 204 of these are fillers (This is 41% of the anime). This is a bit annoying because it did drag out some of the scenes, which I found a bit unnecessary. I think filler episodes break up the flow of the anime and makes me confused about what's happening when they finally end and go back to the main story. However, the anime was really fun to watch. The anime had the right amount of comedy and angst when needed. Overall, the anime displayed good character development (for some of the characters at least), I just wished that it had less filler episodes, but it's to be expected with an anime this big.",7,Recommended,"Jun 28, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3e9034486d,14,679
"Brief overview: A Shonen series that is set in a ninja world with a massive amount of flashbacks. This review will be based on the whole Naruto series from the beginning to the last movie. Boruto will be excluded. Introduction Set's straight after the last Arc of Naruto where Orochimaru takes Sasuke hostage. Meanwhile, Naruto is on a mission to save his close friend Sasuke and get stronger to become a Hokage at the same time. Story 7/10 For most Shonen series the genre always primarily focuses on the identity of what the anime is known for from the beginning. Bleach and Naruto is an action and adventure series where Demon Slayer and Hero Academia are similar but have added romance within it. Naruto sets its identity well at the start especially the romance chart however, as the series progresses it leans more towards telling a deeper story and the romance chart becomes more or less a mess within the characters. The main story is great, but they implemented so many flashbacks towards the original Naruto as fillers throughout the series. It is unnecessary to add so many flashbacks from the original Naruto as we already have witnessed it from the beginning to the end. A good flashback would be outside of the original Naruto such as Hashirama's time period as it tells how the hidden leaf is built or a small flashback that talks about how Hinata fell in love with Naruto. What ruins this series is the romance. The story is trying to incorporate the romance genre into the series which it limits the world content we get to see as the story already has tons of flashbacks and the romance genre doesn't fit into Naruto. This is because it makes the series look like another typical school romance drama which it does not fit into the action, emotional, and rich story world of Naruto. Generally, it's a great story but with so many flashbacks and character narrative, it limits the world we get to see in Naruto such as the Samurai's, Hidden Mist Village, and Iwagakure. Even if they show other villages and places it is not much and it feels/looks more or less the same as all other places that Naruto has visited. The most strangest thing is that they incorporated so much unnecessary modern technology into the world of Naruto such as that fucken ninja using a world war 2 radioman to operate during combat when they already have one of the mind-jutsu that lets one of them communicate through all other Ninjas mindset. I won't be surprised that they would use fucking Gun's in Naruto maybe AK47-jutsu next. Characters 7/10 The characters is definitely well-written but the problem with the characters is that each character's relationship doesn't fit well with the other characters. I give you an example throughout the series they keep trying to say that Sasuke is basically like a brother to Naruto and Naruto is trying to get him back to the good side. Now everything is well written but truthfully Sasuke and Naruto don't work well compared to Naruto and Gaara. If you take a step back and look at it. Both of them understand the same pain and suffering from their childhood when they first met no one understands what Gaara is talking about however Naruto is the only one there that totally understands him because he knows that type of pain and loneliness while Sasuke does not fit in because he already had a family from the start while both of them don't. Another problem is Sasuke and Sakura. Throughout the series, they keep implying that despite all the evilness that Sasuke has done Sakura, still loves him even towards the very end. However, most of the time the relationship between Sakura and Naruto is deeper than Sasuke and Sakura if you look at it. Naruto was there when the Hidden Leaf was about to get destroyed and he was also there during the great ninja war. Both Naruto and Sakura share a very powerful bond with each other as both of them witness catastrophic destruction multiple times. Yes, Hinata was there at the same time but it's only for a brief moment compared to Sakura and Naruto. This is why romance does not fit into this series when the author is trying to make everyone fell in love instead most of the intended characters have barely any relationship development at all. Another problem is the Hierarchy system of Naruto. In the series within a village, the Hokage is usually the strongest one however, during Tsunade's reign most of the time there is so many other candidates that is stronger or at least have more knowledge than Tsunade. A couple of examples would Kakashi, Guy and most importantly Danzo. Aside from all that Naruto is portrayed very well within the Series because if you look at it Naruto was never the strongest or the smartest character within the series. He makes mistakes and those mistakes are learning experiences to make him into a great person which those mistakes gain him trust and allies who share the pain with him within the series. Animation 5/10 The animation suffers the same thing as One Piece it is a coin-flipping type of animation. However, I have never seen anything that is so well-animated yet bad at the same time. One perfect example is the fight with Pain. They drew the fps well but fuck if you look at the face it looks abysmally bad towards the point that is funny. Otherwise, the animation is not bad for the most part but there is time to time when some parts is poorly animated and times when the animation that looks goot yet bad at the same time. TLDR It's not a bad story if you can ignore the massive amount of flashbacks and the ridiculous modern technology that is used in the ninja world. The characters are good but matched towards the wrong characters when they should've been matched towards the character that understands them the most and the animation is a coin-flipping quality where sometimes the animation can look good yet bad at the same time.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 13, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5309c48d56,15,5873
"Naruto Shippuden : The first 300 episodes are clearly nothing compaired to the rest. The last 200 are what made Naruto so good, they are the reason why everyone love Naruto. The sound, the animation, the story, everything is awesome. But there is one thing that bothers me. The ending. It could've been 1000 times better... In my opinion, it should have stopped when Sasuke and Naruto are lying on the ground after the final fight. After that, everything feels like non canon episode. All the hype was gone, and Naruto didn't even become the hokage. Also, the art and animation was batched.

The first 30-40 episodes were alright...not great, but they weren't terrible. After that, there were just too many fillers, strayed quite a bit from the manga and I just dropped it. Also, I believe the anime just kind of got cheesy and the art wasn't as great either. So, overall, I give Naruto Shippuden a 8/10 because of the manga. The art is great, story is great, no fillers...but the Naruto Shippuden anime just gave Naruto a bad name in my opinion.

Even so, it still maintains an interesting narrative bringing action, comedy and drama together until its conclusion. Definitely a classic that has affected world culture and will continue to affect it over the years. Watching after the hype I must say: It is a decent and very fun anime. The good: -It has a good world building. -well developed in terms of characters. - Animation doesn't bother so much. - Good sound design and soundtrack.

"Naruto Shipppuuden has a spectacular story with well built characters. I am not only talking about the main characters, but also secondary characters and especially the villains. Not to mention that it has the best fighting animations ever seen. Not only the animation at technical level but the own choreography and strategies of the fight according to each individual and its power. The story has many ramifications and variants, which despite one and another plot hole (which is understandable because of the extended time of its development) every each character evolve and go through a growth and development of character. Naruto is that character that we can understand and we want to be like him. We see his growth, it is not a character of 2 dimensions, but of 3 or 4. The same happens with many others, and the most fascinating are the villains. Especially those from Akatsuki. For me, Pain is one of the best-built villains I've seen so far in anime and even in movies. I quoted this anime on my master's thesis countless times, exactly because of its story and character construction, and also because of its animations and fight choreography. Anyone who loves a good fight (choreographically and visually) will feel immense satisfaction in this anime. Just like anyone who likes a good story with good heroes and good villains, both quite human. They do not make the characters just the flawless hero or the inhuman villain. No. The characters have a reason that moves them, because of their life experiences. I strongly advise.

"After the original Naruto series the quality of the story diminishes greatly. Mostly because Naruto's popularity made the corporate control over the series much more involved, thus skewing the story to fit polling, and also the narrative got really convoluted just in terms of enemies and power ups and this and that. I'd still recommend watching this just because some parts of the story are worth knowing! If you've seen the og Naruto, seeing Naruto pursue Sasuke, and Sasuke's bid for power and search for the truth are something you want to see unravel. Lot's of really cool fights in this series. Can get really monotonous though, especially if you watch fillers.

If you're a anime junky that is only satisfied by great action and a strong storyline look no further here it is! before watching Shippuden it is a MUST to watch part 1 but honestly if you havne't watched Naruto yet and are feeling put off by the filler sand what you have heard online then all i can say is give it a watch and let me know how you feel once you finish it.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0a142e863a,15,1145
"NB: Recommended to watch Naruto before Shippuden. Because this is a continuation if did not know :) Naruto has been out for years for as long as I know but I never intended to watch it. Everywhere I go and talk with people about anime they will know about Naruto, both those who watches anime and those who dont. My thoughts were quite ignorant and I judged it for being overrated and being popular because its a long watching series, thats all. Until last summer where I binge-watched this B*cth within 2-3weeks. And I can swear to you, it was a beautiful journey where I felt so sad that it ended. I regret somehow, and even wish I tried it earlier. No sugarcoating! Dont let the earlier episodes animation lure you to drop out because the quality is a little low, if you compare it to those high quality anime series NOW. Ok enough rambling about how good it makes me feel :) The good: Story 10: The more you watch it the better and better it will be. No point in this series where the excitment, storyline, and pace drops down. Even at the begnning was already very good. I cant believe the author made this story where all the stuff connected to each other and gave meaning without being forced. I myself believe there is no plotholes, only amazing writing and how the characters interwines with the story so much. Character 9: Sooo many amazing character with deep and amazing background. You will get the feels and sadness for them, even though you have not seen much of them. Cool, cute, amazing made characters in this series, where you will enjoy the good and bad characters. The reason for why I gave it a 9 instead of 10 is because when most of them are that amazing, those with a little less character or personality, with background will fall down the list very low. You might even dislike som of them cause they feel so useless compare to the others character you know or like. Sound 10: The voice acting here is top notch, all of them are suitable for their character. And I love the way whenever they call out for their jutsu. The music in here is legendary for me. From epic, emotional, sadness and sorrow to happiness or the feeling of nostaliga. Beautiful made and brings out the act of the very scene very well. You are gonna be a fan of the music even when you have not watch naruto yet. Art 9: When I give the art 9/10 I am being a little bias here, cause sometimes you can notice the quality is not always top notch or even that good. Sometimes its amazing animation and quality. Other times you can notice the difference of this epiosde and that ep, thats the problem, when Im nitpicking. And the earlier episodes have not that great art if you compare it to the later episodes. Of couse it should be understandable since its older, so its a good thing that there is improvement. The bad: Nothing is perfect and I tell even my most favorite anime is not. Naruto has it flaws and that is the the bad thing. Lets call out for those jutsus 1. Filler jutsu, as fans calls it. Naruto its quite well known for being the king of it. And the amount of it is massive, thats a whopping 44% filler, if I have not recalled it wrong. Some of it was nice to have, but sometimes its downright cruel when you are in the middle of something big and they take you on for a 30 eps journey of filler. Good thiing its finished so you can just skip over those, I recommend to watch some of it though, if you are a hardcore fan. 2. Flashback jutsu. The use of flashback in here sometimes brings out tears of sadness and feels that hits you right in the face. But on other occasions when they show you the flashback of something so many times, it will lose it purpose. I think that was the shame of it on smaller occasions. Other times when flashback is used because the producers are perhaps scared that the viewers have forgotten scenes that they have watched for some episodes back or the ones you JUST WATCHED. And they show you the characters remembering the memories, the bad thing in this is that it has happened before where the character uses A WHOLE EP for that purpose. Thats enough complaining. Overall 10: I mean overall this was a wonderful anime, and I want to share this happiness and joy to as many as I could. I recommend this to be watched in your lfetime, and its strongly recommended by a very picky person. Pardon me if there are some grammar mistakes :) Do take me serious though :D",10,Recommended,"Apr 23, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_486365bc7f,15,4406
"I'll try to keep this short: If you skip most of the fillers (not all), the anime is pretty good. It's one of those animes that grow on you over time, and it's all worth it when you watch the final episodes as if you went on the journey with Naruto, watched him grow from a nobody to one of the strongest people to exist in the universe. The music is really good and well used. It never changes from the original and it's used perfectly. Naruto has the best Anime plot I've ever watched.

"Apart from the war arc and ending this is a great anime. Unfortunately the series ended up being milked at the end for money. Masashi Kishimoto's brother Seishi's o-parts hunter also had a war arc but it was done a lot better than what's in naruto. Yes the war arc has some exciting moments but it lacked a distinct purpose (and there are other parts that have you scratching your head wondering ""does that make sense""). It's pretty disappointing that kishi dropped the ball on the end because i think naruto could have continued developing characters.

"Both series of Naruto were in my opinion unenjoyable, at its worst the anime is inconsistent with animation, plethora of poorly written characters and poor pacing with things like 6 mins of recap footage, cutaways to backstories and flashbacks not necessary to whats going on, and actual interesting characters in the original series that I liked ended up becoming background characters being replaced for even worse written characters. With the 700 episodes of Naruto you could better spend ur time watching 30 smaller 12 episode anime. At its best Naruto is full of unique design, amazing fight scenes and creative fighting styles and techniques, and interesting character dynamics developing one of the most iconic rivalries in anime history. Although I did not take the time to watch all 700 episodes I would not recommend anyone this anime",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 15, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7ac9bc69c1,15,844
"I feel like the ONLY reason this show received so many lower ratings was cause of it's fillers. I don't really blame that entirely on the show with all the studio management, catching up with manga etc. etc. I'm gonna rate this show at the core of it's story. And the Core story, is pretty much second to none. If you are willing to watch all the episodes of this series, which I know is alot, then it is damn worth it. The Story is So Grand, So Emotional, attacks the viewers in a deep and moral level, and so hype/exciting that I just can't get enough of this story and I'll be sad the day this show ends for sure.

"Naruto Shippuuden is a very average anime considering it's vast popularity and will make you wonder why it is so popular. Most people who are watching this or is planning to watch this has seen the previous series. I will warn you now with the exception of Naruto chasing after Sasuke and the female characters still being completely useless please forget everything you think you know about Naruto because it is buried one way or another. Story 7: It manages to keep you in suspense, but sometimes becomes too dark for fans of the lighter Naruto. Art 6: The art is still average. Nothing special. Sound 5: Beware voice actors and tunes that don't fit with a scene. Character 7: Some characters changed drastically, most stayed the same. Some characters are cliche. Enjoyment 7: I'm still watching it so I like it overall. The series pick up from Naruto two years later and we see how much our heroes grown changing the mood to a darker more mature tone. Part of the reason people stay tuned to Naruto was because of the light and refreshing tone so for it to be almost completely gone puzzles me. It makes me miss the plot line of the old Naruto. As for fillers, whether you like it or not fillers need to be use in long anime series so the mangaka can have time to write more. Still I guess the complaining of fans worked because there has been less filler use in the series. The problem is because there has been less filler use the pacing of the show has suffered. Some fights scenes are ridiculously long and constant repeat of the same flashback is the new norm.Even the camera shots are repetitive and unnecessary. For example in one episode with a reunion like air every five seconds you see the face of a character. It gets infuriating at times. Naruto has always been average with their art and this time is no exception. Expect the same overall look with the occasional darker backgrounds to draw more suspense. Also the characters look mostly the same with just a change of their outfit. Since this series is darker than the original Naruto so is the music. Even when it is supposed to be a funny moment sometimes the same dark melody will still play. The openings and endings are mostly mediocre, but if you want to check them out then do so! To me the dark tone of music sets the mood, but is overplayed to the point it does not stand out. Background music blends, but also makes the emotion of the scene stand out and Naruto Shippuuden falls to do that. Also it took me a while to get used to the voice actors. I know the characters have changed, but it's only been two years! Naruto's voice in the sub version sounds like a 30 year old man! When I watched Naruto I watched it in dub and I liked how their voices(even if it was annoying) matched the age of the character and was unique. Many characters in this series voice has the monotone base that never changes making the character boring. Now the moment most people have been waiting for in this review, the characters. ""Do Hinta and Naruto get together?"" ""Who becomes the 6th hokage?"" Well I'm sorry I won't be answering those questions, watch it for yourself. Naruto probably changed more than any other character in Naruto Shippuden. No longer is Naruto the repulsive ninja who acts before he thinks, no longer is he immature. The failure of getting Sasuke back and the training with Jiraya molded the Naruto we knew into a man. He is not even naive anymore. Sure chasing after a friend who doesn't want to be saved is naive in a way, but to me is shows his loyalty more. Sakura may have become a medical ninjia and strong like tsunade, but she is still useless like almost every girl in this series. As for Sasuke, if you still liked him after watching Naruto, well you won't now. Sasuke gets so annoying in this Naruto Shippuden it makes no sense. Sometimes you would wish anyone would kill him. Besides old time favorites you get a new set of characters plus a more detailed background of some minor ones like Kakashi. Still the characters are a little cliched. Overall I still enjoyed Naruto. It's funny considering at first I was totally against watching the new series, but life changes you sometimes. I would definitely recommend this to fans of the ninja genre!

"The beginning of this show starts off great, ill give it a 8 or 9 for the first few hundred episodes. However the show should of ended over a year ago. They had 3-6 episodes left to air as the manga was over and done with. Almost as if they are expecting the show to continue they have been adding fillers, For the most part its 1 drawn out episode then 4-10 filler episodes. The story is great, but the fillers are not, it has became a joke of several of the communities. I do recommend that you watch it, but follow the suggestions of the communities on what episodes to skip. Good story and better artwork then the original, character development was a little bland but expected.

"I'm not using that sectioned up rating system because that's bullshit. I'm also not gonna follow all those rules on the right either so there will probably be spoilers in here. I'll write my review my way thanks guys. This is going in my blogs as well. Something's gotta go there! But oh god, where to begin? I guess with a bit of background. I started watching Shippuden back in the early years of high school when my then friends introduced me to it. The original Naruto was my first ever anime and I watched it in english dub. Naturally I wanted to keep it consistent when I moved onto Shippuden. As the years went on and I carried on keeping up with it, the dub suddenly stopped, but the story hadn't finished. I realised I had to wait. But I didn't want to watch it as it was airing, there were huge gaps between episode releases and even without them I'd struggle to keep track of the entire story for that long. So I gave up. And now, years after the fact, I finished high school, I've just finished college and I notice by chance that Naruto Shippuden's english dub is also finished. So I buckled down and decided to watch in full the thing that has haunted me for 5 years. And hoo boy, that was a journey. Overall, upon reflection the show feels like 480 episodes of meh with some great bits sprinkled in, followed by a final 20 episodes that might as well be a completely different show, they're so good. My biggest problem with the show is, you guessed it, filler. I must've skipped over 100 episodes worth of stuff, from whole episodes I didn't care about, like all those undead dudes we've never seen before but we get a full episode long flashback about them, or the never ending reuse of old scenes to fill space in an episode. When an episode didn't feature a single flashback, it was a mercy. There is one exception though. Paradise Life on a Boat. The arc is entirely filler, but it's also the best arc in the whole show, besides the epilogues. It finally lets up the dull seriousness for a while and let's us have some fun. Naruto's shadow clones staging a revolt, mushrooms of death, these are some of the best episodes of the entire show, and they have nothing to do with the story whatsoever. I don't really have a good segway into this next bit, but let's talk about the characters. I... don't hate Sakura... or Sasuke or Naruto or anyone really. Kaguya's a bit one-note, but gods usually are. I feel sorry for Sakura in particular. She's a great character but she's never allowed to do anything. She keeps saying to herself that she's gonna stand toe to toe with Naruto and Sasuke, but she never does. In the final boss, she does brief support for Obito and then gets one punch in right at the end. Poor girl. And Sasuke oooo, he pissed me off for a good while but, after seeing his final battle with Naruto, I kind of get it. He's been so wrapped up in hate and revenge his whole life he can't comprehend forgiveness even when it's right in front of him, and it takes Naruto literally beating some sense into him that he's finally able to admit to himself that he doesn't want to sever his ties. That's some damn good character writing and I praise Kishimoto for creating an arc this complex for a character he didn't even want to make originally. I was never fully sold on the relationships though. Most of the time I felt that Sakura could do so much better than Sasuke, and I didn't really believe the love between Naruto and Hinata, because they hardly ever interacted in the show. They needed to add in another movie right after the ending but before the epilogues to add some much needed depth to their relationship before dropping the wedding on us. Same problem with Ino and Sai too, but those two were more in the background so I don't really mind that they only interacted once in the entire show (that I watched) before that point. Besides, Ino is like the personification of sex appeal to me (remember, I first watched this show when I was going though puberty) so I'm automatically on board with anything she does (or anyone). Feel bad for Tenten though. I really like her and she even admits in the epilogues that she's spent so much time training and never takes time for herself. I wonder who'd be a good match for her. Maybe Omoi? He was fun. Also, the Akatsuki. In particular, Pain and Konan, because I love Pain's character design so much, and Konan because she's an underappreciated badass. Also Deidara because of his fun personality, and the fact that's he's voiced by Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm glad I waited for the dub. I tend to get really anal when I have to switch between dub and sub, especially when it's a show I care about, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. Maile Flanagan will always be Naruto to me, as will everyone else. Dave Wittenberg is inseparable from Kakashi in my head and Neil Kaplan was a brilliantly threatening Madara/Tobi, just to name a few. In the end, Shippuden kinda feels like a series of peaks and valleys. The highs are super high, the lows are scarily low and there's basically nothing in between. I hate parts of it and I love other parts, especially the well animated parts. Naruto vs Sasuke is one of the most brilliant and emotional fight scenes I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing, and I'm glad I waited till I was 19 so I can fully appreciate it. There were only four moments in this show that made me cry. One was, what you just read, Naruto vs Sasuke when Sasuke is finally able to admit to himself that he wants friends. The other was near the beginning where Gaara is brought back to life and he's surrounded by the comrades he thought hated him, and the third and fourth were Naruto saying goodbye to his parents. Those were some of my favourite moments of the story, and I will never forget them. Aaaaannnnd, I think that's about it. I've gotten my thoughts out, something that's been 5 years in the making. I love this show, and I hate it at the same time. I'm probably not gonna watch Boruto until the dub finishes, so get back to me in 2029. Maybe I'll have gotten over my joint crush on Ino and Tenten by then. Going through it, I figured I'd end up disappointed, like, 5 years of waiting for a 4/10, but thank god they saved it. If you want to watch Shippuden, watch it with a guide. This show is notorious for taking way too long to say not very much, so chop it down wherever you can. I skipped as much as possible but it still took me two months to finish. Or, if you watch nothing else of Shippuden, watch the epilogues, they're like Shippuden god mode and are better than all 480 episodes before them put together. The only question left is, after all that, what the fuck am I gonna do now? It's all over, I can move on with my life. fuck",7,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2f838e6567,15,6757
"Well, if I say Naruto, every one knows what thats mean, fillers, good characters, a story of a lifespan, ninjas etc. So let me rate them one by one. First, the fillers. There are a lot of fillers in Sjippuuden, and some of them are too long to tear apart the exciting actions at the main story line. But, and thats a very big ""but"" I enjoyed all of them, it widened the univers, deepened the characters, get you more excited for the main parts or they were simply funny. And one of them actually hits, someone's face reveal (a photographer camuflaged man), I waited 8 years to see that face! Ninjas. They use chacra to empower their special jutsus. Chacra: It is a recycling type energy that flows in everything, if you use it, you have to ""heal"" it back with resting/meditating. Chacra is also working as the internet, it connects everithing with everything, can transport information, even matter. And in the end you will actually realise that Naruto is sci-fi. There are a lot of characters you will know in Naruto, and all of them develops through the entire series. So if you want a fantasy/adventure like sci-fi anime with some hundred episodes full of emotion and characteristics you will get it from Naruto Shippuuden!

"Who would have thought that probably the biggest anime franchise in existence would be one of the best? I came into Naruto at the recommendation (or rather pleading) of my brother. This was when I was 12 but I soon dropped it because I couldn't deal with all of the pain and heartbreak that our blond protagonist had to go through. Years passed and this show was always at the back of my mind, I knew I would have to watch it again all the way through this time. Completely by chance, I chose to start it very soon after the main story line ended, i.e. the final (really final) battle between Naruto and Sasuke. As I watched the first series, I was a bit disappointed in the lack of epic battles that I had become accustomed to with shows like Bleach and Hunter x Hunter. But then came shippuden, and boy oh boy did that change. Not only did I get my wish of totally insane fights but I also got a much more emotionally mature series. To be sure, the original has a lot of pain, but they really explored it in shippuden. When all is said and all is done, Naruto really stands out as a series that gives hope for humanity and for yourself. Note that what follows is solely based on the main story arc, I am not considering the story/art/sound/characters/enjoyment of fillers. Story - 9: Really phenomenal. There are very few points where I feel like the story is forced, the reasons for the characters' actions are sound. Though the last bit with ""who was /really/ behind the whole thing"" seemed a little convoluted. The story is really driven by the characters, who are also phenomenal. Art - 9: Naruto Shippuden takes a more modern approach to art than its predecessor did. This is to be expected as the whole series has been going on for about 15 years. The new art style fits the more solemn feel of the series, even though there are points of awkwardness. Sound - 9: The new series brings along a new and improved soundtrack. The new songs are great but aren't outstanding. Characters - 8: They are truly amazing, though many of the women are a bit underdeveloped. It has certainly improved since the first series, but alas, you don't always get what you want. Despite this, the characters really drive the story forward with their lifelike traits. Enjoyment - 10: It is truly an amazing show with truly amazing characters and storylines. Though there are flaws, they are overshadowed by the enormous amount of positivity this show produces. Really, this show will make you an optimist. Overall - 9: Naruto is really an iconic story which deserves recognition, sure, it probably reminds you of when you were a weeb. And yes there are a TON of fillers (but in this day and age, one quick google search can tell you which episodes are fillers, so just avoid them), but Naruto Shippuden (and more broadly the Naruto franchise) is among the best stories of all time.",9,Recommended,"Mar 5, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4d312e23c0,16,2866
"Naruto and consequently Naruto Shippuuden were the first set of anime I ever watched, and overall I am thankful for that. It helped give me a strong baseline for comparing other anime to. Naruto Shippuuden is a continuation of the story of Naruto, a boy ninja in a world called Earth, split into 5 countries, each representing a different element, fire, water, etc. He has grown up a bit from the first Naruto series, after training with a legendary ninja of his Fire country in the interim, and is still interested in furthering his relationship with his brother-in-arms, Sasuke. The story-line, outside of the fillers, is interesting if not a bit predictable, the characters are varied and likable, the music is pretty good, and the creativity behind the various ninja skills is awesome. The problem with Naruto Shippuuden, as was the case with the first Naruto series, is that it is riddled with too many filler episodes, regaling exploits and side-stories of forgettable characters and events. Very few filler episodes are worth watching in my opinion. Overall I'd say Shippudden is worth watching, but only if you have a filler list so that you may skip them.",7,Recommended,"Sep 16, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ef4f3ca711,16,1164
"Even with the filler episodes and with certain events being stretched out for what seems like forever, Naruto Shippuuden still manages to live up to it's reputation. This sequel manages to capture the childish tendencies of the previous installment while adding a new sense of meaningful plot and emotion. While the original series dabbled on this, Shippuuden takes it to a whole new level. This adds a whole new layer to the show, with loads of plot elements adding a new sense of maturity to the show, even if it still is very fun and childish. When it comes to the episodes of filler, while they can be annoying to watch, I believe this doesn't take away from the show. It is very tempting on the first watch to skip the fillers and have plot development. While I completely understand this feeling, I believe that this show shouldn't be dismissed as lesser because of how many filler episodes it has. Even when the plot is not being explored in these episodes, they still manage to be enjoyable even if they serve no purpose in the overall story. But even with this opinion, I understand the want for the story to continue. So if you are the kind of person who watches a show for plot development, maybe skip the filler episodes unless you want to see more of Naruto and his friends kicking some ass. Naruto is one of the series which completely deserves the hype around it. It has amazing characters and an amazing story, with plenty of enjoyment to be found in watching it.

"I do not like this show one bit. Nuh uh. I already hated it once they started doing DBZ shit, because it's Naruto. Naruto is supposed to be ninjas. Instead he turns into fucking fox man McGee and becomes literal Jesus at the end of the series. That isn't what a ninja is. Ninjas are stealthy and cool, not spectacle fighting meatheads. Everything that I liked about the og series was just stripped away with this show. The only thing I liked about the story was the Akatsuki. They were great. Very entertaining, very interesting characters. Pain's arc was also good. I cannot stand the rest of it. If this isn't known by you, I don't skip filler. So I had to sit through all 500 fucking episodes of Shippuden and slowly want to carve my eyes out of their sockets for hours upon end until finally it was over. I'll get into art now. Art: The art is good. No real flaws and the Pain frames are memed too much. Character: Hoo boy. I don't like any of the main characters. Naruto is an imbecile who rarely convinces me to like him and Sasuke is the most whiny, bitch-ass, immature character ever. I don't expect them to be perfect, but at least make them develop. What was Sasuke's development? No, seriously. How the fuck did he develop? He didn't. Not at all. ""He became less broody and immature over the course of the series."" That's bullshit. What about him is mature at all? He's a stupid fucking child, through and through, for the entirety of the series. He isn't cool, he isn't fun, he's just whiny. Itachi is 10x better and I don't even like him that much. My favorite character is Jiraiya because he is somewhat interesting unlike the majority of the cast. But you know what they did with him? They fucking killed him. I get that you need to have the mentor die. But come the fuck on. Why then? Make him die in the war. Minato and Jiraiya coming together in the war arc would have been fantastic to see. Also why did Neji die? He didn't need to. That was a pointless death. It did nothing. Enjoyment: I hate this show. It's long for no reason, it doesn't adapt the manga well, I hate the characters, they stopped doing ninja shit, there are like 200 episodes of filler, Naruto and Sasuke never did and never will entertain me, and have I mentioned that I don't like this show?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 13, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0224368b25,16,2282

It also has his internal conflict with the demon inside of him as well as his attempts to be acknowledged by people as he grows in strength. It constantly has you wondering how things are going to turn out as strategy in combat is critical as they often fight enemies more powerful than they are, and must come up with the strategy to get ahead.

"Most people forget what Naruto is and what it is meant to be and start comparing it with anime that arrived a decade later. And it's almost impossible to assign numbers and evaluate a series like this one that has been running over a decade. Naruto was never a show made to compete with mind boggling story such as... I don't know let's say Cowboy Bebop for a lack of better example. But it was made in midst of a shounen revolution where the importance was placed on Friendship, goodness, and perseverance. Naruto is very little about ninjas. In fact it's very bad at portraying what ninjas are. But Naruto is creative at least. Taking this ninja genre and combining it into several martial and weapon arts to make this very unique show. Well unique is a bit subjective but whatever. I applaud the series for combining the natural elements, weapons, and even mixing human behaviors to create a world full of unique fighting techniques. Story wise, Naruto is about the character Naruto becoming the leader of his village. He is an orphan cursed with bearing a monster with him and the whole anime is about him overcoming the world of ninjas, which is filled with hatred and suspicion. See the series have some of the most fascinating characters. Each of them with their own background, although many of them could've been kept a secret for the better story progression and pacing. Many of these characters' actions are justified by their past and as the series progresses you can see how each of them changes and influences each other. However the best aspect of the series is also probably the worst aspect of it. While many main characters are given a good amount of attention and care and many of them are nurtured with logic, others just become fodder characters uttering 1 or 2 lines then their worth are never revisited again. The story of Naruto is about never giving up, making friends, and well, whatever standard shounens babble about. But Naruto is one of the few exceptions because Naruto is rarely a hypocrite and actually always stays around its core beliefs. As the series is ending, it's sad that many of the traits of the characters like Sasuke and Obito are reversing and villains are entering the infamous Dragon Ball complex (you enemy becomes bff lol), the main thing is Naruto remains Naruto: stupid and somehow still influential. After watching this series at different intervals and after watching other anime, I came to appreciate Naruto. Because I watched several long running shounen and nothing really even came close to the emotional appeal Naruto formed. I think I can safely say that this show truly keeps it promise and shows Naruto is a hardworking guy who becomes special. However, I still can't forgive this series for wasting the potential of so many characters, random power-ups, unnecessary glorification of Sasuke and Naruto (WE GET IT THEY'RE THE MAIN CHARACTERS) and Bleach-esque arse pulls. The fillers are downright horrible and let's not even explore the comedy. Seriously, many of the plot like Kaguya and other backstory could have been omitted, no they should have been omitted, to give Naruto a more refined ending but it is what it is. At the end of the day, Naruto is a good series about a guy never giving up as he faces challenge to save his friend and save his village. Indeed it is a tale of a gutsy ninja. Characters like Itachi, Jiraiya, and Pain are some of the noteworthy characters in all of anime. Naruto is a good series on what it stands for. Stop comparing it to high level, 13 episode series because all anime loses its lust after 500 episode mark. On a side note, this is not a proper review. Just whatever I feel about this series.

Oh, and you always smell. And you can't smoke in your car, or in restaurants, and you gotta get up to go smoke and that pisses you off because you're friends are talking shit on you. That's now naruto. You're like, okay, the anime quality has gone down. The art is a bit doofy now, and the animation budget? Did you guys lose a lawsuit? Then there's the fillers. You're like, okay, I guess that one was okay but now this is the 5th one in like 60 episodes, wtf? Then the plot goes way off track and you're like, okay, well I guess it will just get better. So you keep smoking, and say ""fuck all those people. I'll just hang out with smokers from now on"". 2 years of smoking- The end Now you always reek, you can't hang around your nephew, and all your new friends are white trash and smoke newports, and you only smoke camels. You've given up hope, and the doctor says you need to cut back or else. Naruto is now garbage, and you know it is you piece of shit. The animation is laggier than a 1 legged prostitute, and the artwork has been handed over to 12th graders in a graphic design class from somewhere in Upstate Newyork. The plot is now on a different planet, and there's no fucking life there. Good luck finding water fuckhead. Now all your hope is in the music, the only good thing left, and in the remaining characters, which have dwindled down to a small ewok army on the shitty planet that is endor. You don't even enjoy it anymore, you just want it to end. You'll try quitting, but you remember the mange had cool fights and there was that one fight you wanted to see, so you're right back on it, smoking it up. Every episode is a cancer you wish would just explode. You pray for the end of the series with fierce determination that rivals that of a born again christian. Conclusion? I plead dear would be viewers. Don't you fucking dare watch this show. I don't care what your best friend said.

"I don't even know where to begin. When I started watching the original Naruto it was great, tons of potential but once it hit shippuuden it didn't just go down hill, it flew down vertically with no stop in sight. It's depressing to see an anime with a lot of potential be destroyed. As it continues it looks like they are trying to squeeze out all the money possible out of this story instead of just ending it. Many people would disagree with me and a majority wont really give arguments other than being a fan boy but anyway here's my review. Story - Originally the story was supposed to be about a failure ninja who is hated by everyone because of the beast in him. He cries all the time, is extremely annoying to all his peers yet he still blames his beast for being hated. Anyway, the whole plot to this anime is to create bonds, friendships, and get acceptance with the title of ""Hokage"". In the first part of the Naruto series that's exactly what he worked to do and now with shippuuden everything changes, no more bonds, no more friendship, it's just an anime that resembles some sort of animal trade using tailed beasts. Naruto continues to chase sasuke and even after all the advantages hes born with he continues to not be able to catch him. Theres virtually no training in this anime at all, just free powers given over and over. Villains are just a line of people controlling one another. Art - Basic, Average, Modern, not unique. Most of the characters all look like they have been drawn using the same template. Just take off naruto's hair and eyes, throw in sasuke's hair and eyes, BOOM flawless. Sound - The music isn't anything special, usually its an asain man yelling what sounds like ""SEA SAW"" at you with background music. Characters - Not unique, very obvious copy of DBZ. naruto - Easily resembles goku, orange suit, blonde hair, raised by an old guy(hokage), both become monsters with a tail. Only difference is while naruto cried his whole childhood, goku lived alone with innocence. Sasuke - Very obvious copy of vegeta, from the hair, to the death of his whole race and getting revenge. Jiraya - Narutos, frog sage, old, perverted teacher, very similar to roshi, goku's turtle sage, old perverted teacher. Even the way naruto received training was similar, both asked for a large breasted hot girl. Enjoyment - At first it was enjoyable, now it makes you wanna rip your hair out at how ridiculous it is. Overall - 5/10 - and with good reason.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 24, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8f9d2efd88,16,2470
"Naruto is the greatest anime I have watched to date. This anime is all about tragedy and triumph. For every tragedy there is a story of triumph, a story of an underdog overcoming their short-comings and becoming the hero. These tragedies brought me tears and the triumphs inspired me to do amazing things. Never before has anything played with my emotions more than Naruto. Every character has a tragic past, but in the end they are able to overcome their past and become a hero in one way or another. If anything the soundtrack is what tugged and my heartstrings the most. The way the OST was used in every situation made each episode more intense, dramatic or sad. I listen to this OST religiously and even to this day it still brings me to tears and reminds me of the hardships each character went through. I am sitting here struggling to find the words to explain how amazing this anime is but I still feel as if I am not doing Naruto any justice. The endless number of characters and jutsus still amazes me. With every episode there is something new, even the ""fillers"" that people tend to complain about. If you take the fillers seriously then you will learn things about the characters and gain a greater appreciation for them no doubt, especially the side characters. The depth that this series has is hard to grasp because of the numerous generations that this story is told over. The storyline covers centuries of shinobi and how each of their stories effects the next generation, I still have a tough time grasping this theory. Each decision made in Naruto effects the next, whether it is good or bad. Each character is likable in their own special way, even the so called ""villains"" of the show. I wish the anime/manga would never end. Naruto will always have a special place in my heart.",10,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fc8706bab0,16,1800
"My First Review Here. English is not my main language so i may have some mistakes. First of all, the story of Naruto Shippuuden is not perfect and i give it 7 because of the fillers that were unnecessary but without them naruto would not be so popular and the memes around its fillers are amazing.There are some fillers that are good butt others are just so boring and uninteresting. Second, The Art I give it 6 because of Studio Perriot they fucked up a lot of the episodes with bad art and animation but instead they gave us a few rather 100+ episodes or so with good art and animation like episode 322 with Madara. Sound-8-Shippuuden has some of the best anime tracks.I think that a lot of people liked the sound/tracks of the naruto franchise. Characters-7 Team 7 as characters developed a lot through the series.The other characters also had a major development. I like that we can see how the characters change through the series from being a kid who does only trouble to a hero and a legend and most importantly Hokage that is Naruto. Enjoyment-9. Naruto had many amazing fights,sad scenes and funny moments but the fillers ruined a part of the story and the hype.If only the art and animation for some of the fights were better then it'd be perfect but nonetheless i liked every bit of it. Overall-9 I will never Forget Naruto because it was a part of my life for a long time and it will be in the future.Next is Boruto I hope that it'll be as good as Naruto or better.

"SPOILER FREE Shippuden has a GREAT story, but show is garbage because of it's annoying fillers. When the story is really is pacing they meddle with a unrelated episode. So annoying that at some point you will definitely will feel to drop the show. That's why show is hanging in 8 pointer score. BUT if you insist only to root for story and for some characters you will love the show. Story is really twisted, vast and connecting but pacing is slow. They really have great fights really. Some characters are so great that make a great impression. Like Itachi, Madara (you will definitely this guy) Some character will make you puke. Like Sakura or sakura or else sakura. It's a anime worth giving a shot. I only gave this anime decent rating because of story and some great characters. Last thought: Everybody can enjoy this story. If you enjoy this then don't even try to watch ""Boruto"", yeah, like seriously even if you have time that story which took naruto setting for granted and ruined it will only make your day bad.

"The anime is good, I liked it, but there are points where they went wrong. Poorly used characters (that could be fucking harnessed), I also did not like the fact that they used the Edo Tensei just to have the war. And one point I did not like too, is that, from the moment Naruto went into the war, only a single day passed. Also has the fact of the doujutsus, in Naruto Classic, all had the knowledge of two doujutsus, that are respectively, Sharingan and Byakugan. They fucking enjoyed the Sharingan, until Magekyo appeared in the classic and taus, but nothing said that they could summon a megazord. I know these things are secret and blablabla, but, do you really think they were thinking about these things when they created the Sharingan? (In this case Kishimoto). But, like I said, I liked the anime, the anime story until it was good ... Until the war started, that sucked. I also liked the fights, the important moments and the appearance of the Akatsuki, the Plot. So my grade is 6 for that.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 10, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_76ec0cd4bf,16,1001
Naruto is a masterpiece buttttttttt jjba part seven steel ball run is ranked second so TAKE THAT NARUTO STANS.But if im being for real naruto is a masterpiece and in my opinion its a starting anime there are so many genres but naruto is just a average shounen jump normal power system and very well boring at times.Out of 500 episodes 210 are fillers thats 40 episodes away from being half FORTY.Almost half of naruto is just fillers and straight up boring.Comparing it to jjba is in my opinion pretty rude so I wont.Now that we got past the bad part the good parts well its probably just the memorys and friends i made.Naruto was the first anime I have ever watched (other than pokemon) so it will always hold a place in my heart.,7,Recommended,"Mar 13, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7332136e8f,16,731
"This may be a hot take but I do not find Naruto to be a very well written character. He has no character growth throughout the show and you always know what he will do. It makes the show agonizingly predictable. Also many main cast characters such as Sakura are also very poorly written. Its also a shame because Naruto has some of the most well written characters in all of anime, but they are surprisingly under covered in the story. Secondly the show does a great job making a very interesting story between Sasuke and Naruto (although I think its a bit under-covered). Also the story behind Itachi is truly a written masterpiece. Overall the main thing the story has going for it is that the writers did a great job of making lovable characters. You are hooked to the anime to see if the characters will succeed. And in the end they do. But now... yall know I was going to talk about this... Fillers... Okay so... If I take away the fillers I would rate naruto probably a 8 or 9. But the sheer antagonizing fillers brings this show all the way to a 5. If you calculate. 47% of this entire show is filler. Let that sink it. Even if you have a filler guide, near the end the fillers all have some vital info so you need to watch SMH.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 11, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d693411f80,16,1235
"Naruto Shippuden one of the most captivating animes I have seen. Out of the few animes I have completed I'm glad I made it to the finale of Naruto but let's get to the review now. Story- Naruto Shippuden has a really detailed story at times the pacing isn't the greatest but overall I think they did a good job. Many people will say there's to much ""filler"" but to me there are many cool stories told in them and even sometimes things that could have been apart of the manga like when the akatsuki caught the 3 and 6 tails. Speaking of the akatsuki what an amazingly well written villain group and there motivations are well explained especially later when introduced to Madara. Madara might be the best written villain in anime I say might because I haven't finished many anime yet. This story is fantastic and many more that are considering Naruto Shippuden I would definitely recommend it. 10/10 Character Development- There's alot of development for characters from Naruto to Filler Characters. Naruto goes from an outcast and hated by the village to proving himself and earning the respect and love of all the leaf (even though he could have turned on them). Kakashi goes from someone struggling with depression and at fault not seeing any happiness to being able to forgive himself and be a leader for young ninjas in Konoha. Itachi goes from being someone that was precieved as a murderer and awful human to being someone who ultimately did anything he could for his brother and village. The only characters that didn't see any development were Sakura and Sasuke in my opinion. 8/10 Animation- The animation was pretty solid throughout and really shines at the most crucial moments. 8/10 Overall- Naruto Shippuden is an amazing anime with consistently good animations and an amazing story that gives most of its characters great spotlight to become more fleshed out and complete the only thing that should have happened and didn't was Naruto becoming the Hokage at the end but it makes since as he was still a genin (even though he's Kage Level). 9/10",9,Recommended,"May 10, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d1e58e1f4c,16,2058
"One of the best animes there is Naruto is recognized as one of the faces of anime and one of the big 4 for a reason. ill give a short review on the story, characters, and fighting below. i'll do this without spoiling :D Story: the story of Naruto is very well thought out. It has a red line and the villains and their objectives stay the same while simultaneously evolving as we progress with the story. Naruto and the other characters have a lot of growth and as they grow their opponents are scaled with them. meaning in the beginning when Naruto is still not that strong he does not really face the end boss level characters. it feels very organic how the power scaling is increased, its not like ""he defeated the boss here is another boss who is 10x stronger"" but instead he fights weaker opponents while growing, or he has help by strong allies. as the story progresses they get stronger and can handle stronger foes. There is also some drama aspects touching on topics like forgiveness, revenge, love and other stuff. this makes the series even better. when they touch on the characters lives it makes the series more personal to the viewer and not just some slop you watch and forget. There is however one flaw that the series has and its the fillers. since the story was not complete the animators had to create filler episodes which can get a bit tedious. I watched them all haha but truth be told sometimes i wished they didnt use them since back when i watched it i saw the new episodes weekly. 41% of the show is fillers. theres a LOT you learn about the characters that is not included in the source but that they added, some of it is worth it some not. if you don't have patience since the story is already very long, look up guides on which episodes are complete fillers and which ones are half filelr half story and try to watch only the story and the story-filler episodes. Its definitely worth it Characters: all characters are so well thought out, everyone has a unique personality and all the important characters have so much growth. if you watch the original Naruto and Shippuden then you feel like you grow up with these characters and you really root for your favourites, and you feel sad when some of them die. The show does a wonderful job expanding on the already existing characters while also introduing new ones all the time. sometimes they swap the main characters squad members, but its always under very non-forced conditions that atually are needed to progress the story. like if a character is hurt and is healing then that character is replaced with a substitute for some time. or since this is Shippuden, as everyone knows, Sasuke is no longer part of team 7, so they get a third member. Not that there is a lot of team 7 activities lol Fighting: the fighting is another aspect that makes the series shine just like the story and the characters do. the fighting scenes are really good, there is a giant variation of different attacks and every characters (expect background ones) have their unique fighting styles. it never gets boring. everytime a new character is introduced you get excited to find out how that person fights. even though the series has a lot of big moves and super strong attacks it still feels a little realistic in the sense that a cut wound will cut and that characters can die. its not like they will take giant attacks to the face, bounce a 100 times, hit some wall and just get up (unless they have some protective layer or something lol). Its important that the characters actually dodge the attacks, which is why substitution jutsus and dodging skills are something most characters also have. a lot of characters use different ways to avoid attacks as well which gives the combat another layer of exitement. its not only unique offensive skills but unique defensive skills as well. so the viewer is left thinking ""how will he survive"" as well as ""how will he defeat his opponent"" most times someone fights. except the people with plot armor the series is not so forgiving to attacks. some very strong character could lose his arm in a random fight agains another character, and then have to fight the rest of the series with only one arm for example. although most of these injuries and deaths do not happen to the collective ""main characters"" which basically are the people from the same generation as the main character. they survive most fights and its other filler characters who are introduced later on that get all misforture overall: 10/10 across. the only downside is that the show consists of 41% filler episodes",10,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1fdee68a64,16,4586
"Naruto shippuuden could have been a really good anime, but, after a while in the anime they start using flashbacks, and not a few. Sometimes these flashbacks takes up 90% of a epsiode and the episode after shows even more flashbacks. Most of the flashbacks are not needed therefore they ruin the show. The story it self is really good and is something that you can come a long way with, and they do they continue to put out new arcs that fits with the story. It could have been great.

"I have been sa watcher of Naruto for over three years now, and I must say, it has changed A LOT! Allow me to explain. Story: The Story overall is kind of good. I like the whole original idea of Ninjas being the supreme beings in the world and like to kick each others asses just to show off their powerful swirling balls of air. In fact, sometimes it was SO original, that I couldn't even keep up with the huge cluster fuck of plot twists and new characters that were popping up in between canon and filler arcs. Since I made I to that part, let's talk abouit the fillers. YAAAAAYYY! We all luv um. I lied, I hate them actually. And Naruto's fillers are SOO BAD that I, at one point, dropped the anime for a year, came back a year later, and they have only advanced 20 episodes of Canon. The gap between canon and filler is so small now. There is new BORING filler arc every month. It is PATHETIC!!! Art: The art for the anime was pretty good at the beginning of the series. The character design was complex and different, but as the series progressed, the art became lazier and lazier. Did you see the art for the Pein Arc? Holy Shit, what a fucking mess. And its only been worse from there. I'm scared that its going to turn into fucking Lucky Star five years from now. And we all know its going to last that long too, so shut up. Sound: All of the openings are also lazily done including the transitional music. They all sound the fucking same! The first Naruto series before Shippuden was pretty gifted in its music. Sadness and Sorrow was a really good song. One of my favorites, but it all went downhill from there. Character: There are s many characters, and surprisingly, I've managed to memorize all of their names. It's pretty amazing, . But seriously, thatsd the problem. Theres just too many. And the ones that are superfluous are just a waste of animation! They are fricking annoying and can't fight for themselves! All of his friends are pretty stupid.

"I will always have a soft spot for Naruto Shippuden. I practically grew up watching it and let me tell you, it was not just a cartoon for me, it was an a history with many lessons, the formation of those lessons and life as well and then, some very good tips on becoming brave, striving on and most importantly, friendship. Beginning or rather ending with the first episode towards the last one, Naruto Shippuden is absolutely amazing and there is no better way to express this rather highly by fiddling the emotional strings of the die-hard fan. The centre of this Changing formula is in character development, notably in the case of the protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki. Naruto’s many stages of growth and development would also contain such changes the most important one being the transition from undesirable to stubborn and prominent teen-hero intending to be the Hokage once within his lifetime which was quite well motivating. Easier said than done. It is not merely a physical endurance but also a active resolution to stop difficulties and a battle waged within oneself that in the end makes a person out of the weak boy. Moreover, he seeks for reasons to walk the path he has never stepped before, awakes at the sit of turmoil and the heat of the matter sort of thing, and anger towards the external enemy gets repressed— a fact for which there is no room in the epic, and all these qualities do not let the reader forget the character of that boy. Furthermore, the show explores these characters and their bonds further like every other shounen anime or manga does, each with their own story. These three and the rest known are not just flat figures, they are also very talented and intelligent individuals who had great deal of learning and want to have certain values. My enemies in good movies and reading really battles and flip these enemy attitides. The growth of Naruto’s relationship with each of these people, in particular his bond with Sasuke along with the rivalry, is one where one can not take his eyes off the screen. Adding to the fact that Naruto Shippuden tops all other in terms of high production-value action scenes and strong fighting performances, it also has exceptionally high quality pre-written dialogue for the performances. The details of the fights are beautifully evocative, yet most notably these action scenes are very effective in their delivery of tension. It’s not just the content of each dangerous bout that feels substantial – either against fearsome opponents or battlefields filled with military conflict – but the stakes as well, because every fight is significant and not only for the purpose of showing different abilities. Yasuharu Takanashi, the composer for the show, also did all of the soundtracks, most of which were loud when played and made Naruto Shippuden a highly emotional show. Every emotional instant is enhanced with the skillfully composed songs including the famous theme songs and the mystifying background music, established an extremely strong bond with the viewer making the playback of the show enjoyable fully. I can say with confidence, that for me. Naruto Shippuden wasn’t only an anime that I loved - it is a series that many I northern crumpled, watching it along growing up and hence this fact holds several alright memories. It has episodes that evoked my emotions, others made me laugh, and somewhere in between them I had to review my life’s ideals like how much loyalty is important, how some kind of stiff adherence to faith and resolve is wrong and how it’s wrong to abandon all one’s dreams… Such a show is motivational and it will remain a fond memory and a part of me. I would most certainly rate Naruto Shippuden as a 10/10. It is not just a piece of work but a piece of art because for people, me as well, that have a certain age this is a part of them, the part that they grew up with.",10,Recommended,"Oct 5, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_082b0b46a8,17,3875

The series started getting dull because of the characters, the animation and the story also, I'm not saying that this series didn't have AWESOME moments but unfortunately, there are more bad moments than good ones. The few Naruto fans that I know, told me that they stopped watching Shippuden out of frustration and honestly I don't blame them BUT by the end, the show redeems itself and I would say that aside from the little flaws that annoy me, the end is pretty satisfying.

There are dozens of different characters and every one is unique.

"In my opinion, Shippūden surpasses the original Naruto in some ways. Both are amazing shows, so what you favor more is up to you. Whether you decide on that or not, it is undeniable that Naruto Shippuden is a very successful and strong follow up to Naruto. It further explores the depth of many characters old and new. My favorite thing about this show is how each antagonist hardly feels like a villain. I was touched by their philosophies and how each compared to Naruto, the classic “bring peace to the world” guy. My only complaints with the show were the dragging out of the Great Ninja War. This show, for me, was a 10/10 until the War.

"I have watched Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden as a child and loved the action, now that I am older an have been watching anime for many many years (17) out of the hundreds of shonen anime, Naruto takes the first place prize! you can watch Naruto simply for the action, but you can dig much much deeper into the characters past and see their development, as well as see the wonderful meaning behind the story, the depth of some characters truly amazes me, and the mystery is not lacking either! You truly feel like your there experiencing these characters emotions as well as the story first hand! This is a great first anime especially! I cannot tell you how many people have gone from hating anime to loving it because I recommended Naruto series to them. I consider my self a seasoned veteran when it comes to shonen anime, and I am pretty picky about what I consider 10/10, but Naruto hits the ball out of the park!! Even the 3rd time I watched the series all the way through, there was STILL things that I did not even think about and mystery to uncover. IF you have not watched Naruto I suggest you do, stick with it and really look at the whole show (depth, story, characters, plot, theme) or just stick around for the fights, up to you either way you will not be disappointed! The last thing I will leave you with is, if you really do not like filler, skip the Naruto fillers and go back and watch them at a later time. A lot of them are really funny, JUST MAKE SURE THEY ARE ACTUALLY FILLER! some episodes are cannon/filler mix!",10,Recommended,"Apr 16, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7510f2a127,17,1530
"The sequel to Naruto's first part is bigger, better, and most definitely worth your time. This is an anime every anime fan should see, a timeless masterpiece. There's a reason Naruto is part of The Big 3 Shounens. Like all anime and manga it has its shortcomings, so I'll talk about what's good and what's not. Overall however, this is beyond phenomenal. First off, if you want the best experience watching Naruto: skip all the fillers. And I mean all of them. I'll talk about that later. I don't even know where to start with why I love this masterpiece. As if the 'original' Naruto series wasn't already fantastic Shippuden cranks things up to 100; mostly for the better. The 220 episodes of Naruto hyped up the Akatsuki, and they sure as hell delivered Characters: I've never seen more 10/10 characters in one anime. Shippuden introduces almost double the amount of important characters and they all are beyond amazing. It just gets better as you watch. Fights: 10/10. Easy. Mob Psycho, Chainsaw Man, and Jojo tier-fights. Apart from some of them being a bit drawn out these are some of the most logical, entertaining, consistent, and emotional fights. Plot & Filler: The canon plot is slightly drawn out, especially the last arc of Shippuden, but it nonetheless is a 10/10. The characters, fights, plot twists, and everything in between are so addictive and fun to watch. Now filler. 'Older' animes used to add a bunch of filler, god knows why, and naruto is certainly one of them. Over 200 episode in Shippuden are filler. Two. Hundred. And they are horrible, just like part 1 of Naruto. Don't do what I did and sit through every one of them, it's not worth it. Skip all of it, genuinely only 8 or so episodes out of the 300 naruto filler episodes spanning this and part one are worth it: The Kakashi Mask episode (part 1) and Kakashi's Anbu arc. Overall: 9.8/10 There's a reason Naruto is and will forever be one of the most popular and highly loved anime of all time. A must watch for anyone who finished part 1, and if you haven't seen part 1 you should. It's incredible.

"Here we have a world that holds quite an immersive story which not only advances over time, but even events of the world's past end up building up the events that took place in the story's present era. As for the characters (ignoring filler characters) we saw a lot of them grow up over time (especially due to the use of the time skip) as well as see just how corrupting a tale of revenge can be. Though of course we'll always have our complaints on some things ('Useless' Sakura and Sasuke only paying an arm for his actions), but they don't really do much damage to the series overall. So great series overall...but the only real downside in my opinion would be the sheer amount of fillers in this and its predecessor (Naruto).

"Many of you will maybe be surprised of why i gave Naruto: Shippuden a 10/10, and trust me, i don't understand 100% either... To be completely honest, I would never say this was the best anime of all time, my rating is more personally. Anyways.. Story: The story in Naruto is good, and just amazing, no doubt about that. The story never really got boring for me, it kept becoming even better. I would say that it is one of the best stories in anime, and I really recommend watching it if you love good stories. Animation: The animation overall isn't bad at all, but when it came to fight scenes it went a little off at times, and the reason for it was simply just for their choice of style in some fights (Which happens a lot in anime, not just Naruto). But most of the fights are amazingly animated, and I'll watch them again. Fillers: I know damn well that Naruto has many goddamn fillers, and many of them are below average.. But I really don't want to rate an anime for their fillers, and I don't understand why people trash talk it this much. If you don't like it, then most of them are 100% skippable. Personally I choose to just watch them. And no, I did not enjoy them, but a couple of them were fairly okay. Music and sound: The music in the original Naruto is good, but had some that were under decent. In Naruto: Shippuuden all opening are and just the music in the episodes are great. I really liked and enjoyed it all. Character: The characters in Naruto is outstanding, i would say it's at least in top 10 animes with the best characters, maybe top 5. All tho the villains and main characters are made greatly, there were some characters that they missed too much potential in, and that really annoys me. The character development is great, but it could have been much better. They really went carefully when choosing people to die, but to be honest, they didn't choose enough. And it could have made it even better. There were too many characters, and so you would have expected a lot of them to die, but apparently not. Ending: I can't really say the ending was perfect, but i wouldn't say it wasn't good either. It became a little rushed at the end, but i think it worked out okay. Sub or Dub?: I watched it in Sub, and i also think Sub is the better choice. I didn't watch dub, but i watched a little of it, and i liked it. They were both made finely. Overall: I gave it a 10/10, which is very overrated, i know i know. But personally, i can't stop giving it 10. The Anime just hit me differently. But if i had to give it a rating outside that, I'll give it a 8/10. Maybe 7,5/10. Also, the anime was also really carried by the story. The best elements of the show are the music/sound, characters, story, and personally the plot too, even tho the plot can be basic at times.",10,Recommended,"Oct 12, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_8dc92adc4a,17,2790
"Oh, Naruto. An anime that you never thought would never end. I've seen shonen anime like this where it's essentially a story about someone wanting to be something in their future, as well as something more compared to others who have tried. Part 1 dealt with the whole idea of strategy vs talent. It made you feel inspired to go out into the world and essentially be who you want to be and not be limited by anything out there. The concept of it's possible no matter what anyone else says. Shippuden aka Part 2 is different and in that, it's focus was more on the world of Naruto rather than the actual character. Sure, Naruto Shippuden has interesting characters but the focus was obviously more on how they were (their backstories) rather than their present life. Sure, events transpire and they're still awesome to look at.. but when you look at it, it's like Naruto Shippuden became more interested in adding characters rather than actually developing them. Sure, they did but it felt very slow. It's not something bad just something. Quantity over Quality even though Shippuden does have its moments. In fact, this whole idea of Shippuden being very different and somewhat lost what made it special reminds me of the shift from the first 3 Fast and Furious movies all the way to the ""now"" which are completely action with less racing. The only outward thing I can say about Naruto Shippuden is that it's a lesson on how a writer can have problems when something they've created has become so huge that it's completely messy. Don't get me wrong, I like the characters as well as the overall story. But the way it was told was a little slow. Not only that, but this particular show is littered and cursed by filler. It's technically a meme that Naruto Shippuden is known mostly by its messy filler in between the stories that make it good and to be honest, that's what sad about it. Naruto has always been a story where you can pretty much feel emotion running through you especially since the writer/author is good at conveying emotion through his fights. However, because of Shonen Jump's harsh schedule, it ruined his draftsmanship and overall, ruined the anime. Nevertheless, Shippuden is undoubtedly a phenomenon. With iconic villains and characters as well as notable abilities and moments with amazing conclusions in its stories. This had a great finale to something so huge that it can be comparable to Harry Potter's Deathly Hallows and the MCU's Endgame. Every segment in Naruto is an event; An idea that Boruto or any anime might never, or might not be able to replicate ever again. It's an anime that meant to a lot of people and it will never be forgotten. However, like life itself; it had to end. And while it ends, you can feel the emotion through each final episode. And it shows that the writer, while he had his flaws, is truly a talented and amazing writer.

"Naruto is a series that a lot of people enjoy, my self-included at one point. That opinion changed however upon a second view of the series as a whole. While the many flaws that exist within this show could be repeated, they are ultimately mute as the real problems that exist in this show are most prevalent in it's story/character direction and its predictability. Naruto is a story that set itself up from the very beginning as a tale about a nobody coming from nothing and struggling to become the greatest so as to earn the respect and acknowledgement of his peers and those in his community. It is a decent plot, one that has been unfortunately been beaten like a dead horse throughout shonen for the past several decades. As many know upon the completion of Shippuden however, that idea went out the window. Naruto is revealed to have been the reincarnation of the Christ analog of his universe as he and the rest of the main cast of heroes and villains are ushered into the levels of godhood that no other ninja regardless of effort could hope to replicate. Many state that this is where Naruto lost sight of its identity but I argue something more introspective. It never had one. Naruto has always had the Nine-Tails inside of him since episode one, a mass of chakra with whom there are no contenders. Naruto uses the Nine-Tails to overcome every fight in the series in some way, shape, or form with one (arguably two) exceptions. Unfortunately, that isn't rising from nothing. That's taking the worlds greatest advantage and using it like a crutch instead of bettering yourself but then passing it off as of own efforts born of sweat, blood, and tears. If you took the Nine-Tails away from Naruto or created a situation where he couldn't bulldoze his way through a fight with virtually unlimited power, I can guarantee you that Naruto would lose and his opponent would be uninjured. All of his efforts only amount to him getting beat up on screen for ten minutes until he decides to end his fights with his signature technique, the Nine-Tails, or a combination of the two. You could watch all the fights that transpired with Naruto and 99.8 of them end this way. It gets to the point where fans of the series already know in the back of their mind how a fight is going to end before it even starts. Beyond that, the cast suffers from Bleach syndrome, in that the series has way too many side characters and jutsu and doesn't develop a majority of them beyond the surface level. The main cast is okay. I don't dislike Sakura and though she can be infuriating at times, I regard her as just another shonen woman who is doing her best to contribute to a series that primarily doesn't need her. I found Sasuke interesting, even for rival archetypes as his role is primarily undefined by Naruto which is good. Barring some moments where he acted out of character through the later half of the series, I was at least invested in his story. Kakashi is a great character with whom I probably never would have gotten through Naruto if he was not there. His role as the group mentor however was not the best as he is quickly abandoned by all three main characters midway through the series and is then out right replaced during a particular arc only to note upon his return that his students have surpassed him and don't need him anymore when they arguably have never needed him. The series also falls victim to key events that are ultimately made contrived to the point of insanity for the sake of preserving continuity and plot holes so gaping, I'm surprised they haven't imploded the series into several, conjoining black holes. I don't hate Naruto, as it is a series that does it's job in entertaining viewers (to an extent) but I can't help but feel as though it failed to tell the story it wanted to tell. Even part of the end goal is not even addressed until another (less popular) spin-off which cheapens the adventure that viewers invested their time in to see. While I would not recommend this series to anyone curious, I will not deter them from doing so as Naruto is an undeniably an experience but one that may leave you feeling disappointed and cheated.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 11, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_999e0220af,17,4168

But my dumbass was like 10 at the time and looking back it was mediocre at best and I don’t understand how people older than me can see it as otherwise. When the series first started, the show was about strategy and mastery of stealth, jutsu, and planning. Now what? Who can explode more shit? Who has the biggest ghost monster.

"Naruto shippuuden is one of the best anime series ever made. This is the first time i am reviewing an anime series ,i have watched more than 70 anime series yet but my first review had to be naruto because i grew watching this ,i have learned so much about real life from it ,my ideal my way of thinking has been influenced by naruto.I can't tell how much i have cried watching this show ,there are just so much emotions in this show ,that u can feel every character .I can't remember how much i cried watching naruto ,the music is just too good it will make you crying and still now when i watch naruto (after 6 years of finishing it) it still make my eyes wet.This show gives great message which are applicable in real life. Lets start the review by talking about the story ,Naruto shippuden has one of the best story written ever , a normal human can never think of such a great story ,the story of naruto shippuuden is its root ,the base of the show .Its a very emotional and motivating story. The story will not disappoint you .The story is so well connected with past and present the characters are so well jumbled up with the plot ,every characters have significant role .Every character is given so well background and there are so many great characters thats y people have liked so many characters other then main characters .i definitely recommend watching this show because the story is just so good with every element like emotions ,hatred ,rage , sacrifice ,love and much more that this story is just so much worth watching.This fact is to be noted that the base of the story are taken from real world legends ,like the concept of chakra ,the kaguya princess ,indra-ashura , which i think is really a great work. The animation studio did a brilliant job in this show ,this much good that some of the current show are not able to .Let me say naruto series have one the best fight scene ever made ,and the intelligence and chorography is amazing in the fight is just too great. Another best thing of naruto is the music ,i will not say that it has one of the best music work because it has the best music work i believe ,the music is just too awesome believe me ,the opening and ending are soo soo good that they will stay alive even after the show has ended not every op and end is great but most of them are amazing. The emotional theme ,from moment to moment really hype me up , seriously the work on music wheather it op and ed or the theme everything is just too too good ,no matter what words i pick i can never appreciate them enough. Naruto is definitely every emotional show ,but that's not all about it there is great comedy in it which makes us laugh out loud , memorable battle scene are there ,so many great quotes of different character that we can realize in our life ,its not just a show when u watch it ,u live it ,deeper and deeper u can fell in this show ,u can feel the emotions and they are so realistic ,which makes u cry like hell ,i think when we cry watching a show then it means the author was able to convey u what he wanted .its not just a show for me ,its a feeling ,a feeling that i love very much ,i really wish that all the memories of this show gets deleted so that i can watch it again ,feel the way i used to ,cry the way i used to ,be excited about those suspense. Lets talk about the drawback of the show ,even when it's one of the most amazing show ever made ,still it has too many drawbacks , everyone knows about it that it has too many fillers ,which is one the biggest problem also the reason of low rating ,just too many fillers. If they could remove the fillers and releasing separately then i am sure naruto could have been in top 10 list. I can keep on writing about this anime , because it made me feel that deeply but i will end it here. Thank you so so much for giving us such awesome show , really appreciate the author of the show ,the whole studio ,all the music work ,all the hard work is really appreciated thank you so much for giving us naruto.",10,Recommended,"Jul 2, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3e15a16f73,17,4011
"God I hated this whole series.... *spoilers ahead* 1.Bad Character development of girls especially. 2. No reason to hate Naruto bcoz he is a jinchuriki. Yes, he being hated for being mischievous is fine. But throwing stones at him and all was just too much. I would question the mindset of Leaf village of the people once lead by Hashirama. 3. No concrete reasons for Madara for doing what he does. Why does he want to make world better by putting everyone in The Matrix? (except Pain and Orochimaru their reasons were best). 4. Plot holes and unexplained power ups at the end. 5. Fillers....sooo many horrible filers And here my major reasons- When you have created such a huge world it is important to explore that (especially 5 great nations). There was no proper exploring of the entire shinobi world, the various customs, history, etc. Most important- why create the whole concept of Jinchuriki and Tailed beasts and show only two of them properly (Bee and Naruto, I am not even counting Gara). I wanted to know all Jinchuriki names, powers and back stories and most importantly see their all out fights with akatsuki and others. Also don’t each of the tailed beats have some special power that even their jinchuriki can use? (other thab TB bombs and chakra cloak). Most important#2 Do all cool and badass clans live in Konoha? I wished to see other village clans and their keke genkais. But as i said there was no exploring. Deidara and kisame were only good other village ninjas for me. Why make the 7 swordsmen of mist if not going to show each properly. Only Zabuza and Kisame are shown all cool. All of them should've been cool and shown in all out fight against protagonists and other characters and be in the story. Also, other than Kisame’s and Zabuza’s swords others were not that cool. Samehada was way too cool. All 7 should be equal badass swords. Other villages top fighting forces should’ve been shown. Just like 7 Shinobi swordsmen. Rock Lee was done bad, he had potential to be awesome! Might Guy should’ve died. His death would’ve been very impactful. Seems his life is just a pitiful drag on now on a wheel chair. Orochimaru should’ve remained evil. Who doesn’t want an ultimate evil genius? He should’ve been one of the ultimate villains. And also if possible he should have been a major threat in Boruto too. Uchiha clan became too Strong due to Sussano power. I wish it was a Rinnegan specific power. Reanimation in the end was not following rules. Madara could do just whatever he wants. It seemed a bit like plot device. The Otsutsuki clan should’ve been hyped from the start (of Naruto series) and a proper back story for origins of chakra and Ninjutsu should’ve been given- step by step. So when Kaguya finally makes her appearance it would look cool. In all Naruto had all the potential to be the best anime ever. Awesome fight scenes and great animation but if you had the huge budget you should of hired better writers",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 15, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ae4cb1cb05,17,2951
"Shippuden is literal fillers to the characters past. But incase you're skipping all the fillers,it's an enjoyable series. Plenty of likeable characters even though Naruto is still cringy to watch :/. I remember so many of the OP's in Naruto because it's just that good. The character development is tolerable,I suppose. The story feels rather slow at times,but it's alright for a shonen anime. In my personal opinion,the Pain arc is the best. Nothing can top that. The action is nice but not that amazing. Naruto:Shippuden is an alright anime at it's core but it can be enjoyable if you're into this kind of stuff.

"Story: You can break the story of Naruto Shippuden down into one sentence. Naruto's best friends Sasuke Uchiha did fall on the ""dark side"" and Naruto himself is a great bro so he does everything to bring him back without ever givin up. Sounds pretty boring doesn't it? Well while the story progresses the whole thing gets a lot more complicated. Naruto and his friends would have to face several ""bad guys"", train a lot to be able to beat them and lose a lot of precious people (very emotional! :( ) and the great thing about it is that everything actually connencts. Talking about the bad guys...they aren't actual bad guys and this is something I liked a lot about Naruto. Usually they are just people who had a really rough live and therefore developed some ""bad"" but pretty logical philospohy. For example one enemy believed that it is impossible to understand one another except if everyone understands one another's pain. And to understand pain you must experience pain so he became the bad guy to spread pain over the world. During Naruto's fight against that person they had quite an interesting philosophical conversation- something that the series does a lot. The only negative aspect about the sotry is that some of the so called filler episodes (episodes that don't really provide anything to the plot but are pretty important to have a deeper understanding for the character's development aka episodes that you won't find in the Manga) are really bad placed. For example during one of the most intence arcs of the show we got Fillers from OG Naruto- without any logical reason!! My personal opinion is that you should still watch them but you can decide that for yourself (there are filler lists in the internet). 9/10 Art: On one hand some of the greatest most memorable fights in Anime history and some really weird animations due to outsourcing of the animation studio but overall pretty solid. 8/10 Sound: Let's be real on this one. Naruto Shippuden's OST is one of the greatest of all time.

Why you might ask? Well simply because all of them are very interesting and most of them have quite a depth due to their past and their actions during the story. The characters will stick to you and if you actually think about them you might learn some valuable lessons about life. Enjoyment: I loved it and felt a vast emptiness after I finished the series and the movies. Overall: For me a 10/10.

"One of the most overrated anime in the century. I understand that the manga could appeal to a lot of people but frankly, the anime was really bad. I have counted in total 223 filler episodes on 500. Don't you think that almost half of the episodes of the anime is way too much? Moreover, 90% of these filler were not interesting at all. I know that they put it there so the anime doesn't catch up to the manga but it was way too unsatisfying. It is because of these filler that I dropped the anime for a long time. The art was not bad, I mean some jutsu were kind of original and pretty. The OST/Openings were good too. If they had just put the manga stuff, I would probably rate it with 8/9 but the way they handled the anime was bad. NB: The characters were not really interesting, some characters were really likeable like Jiraya, Minato, Naruto, Shikamaru,... but on all the characters(those that we know the name at least) I was able to like only 5-8%.

It has fantastically deep and dimensional characters, the fights (while I see why others think differently) look gorgeous, and lastly, it truly puts the time into forming the plot and doesn't feel rushed. Lastly, I feel its incorrect top judge Naruto and Shippuuden separately, if watched in a single stretch the events of Shippuuden feel perfectly written and well played out.",10,Recommended,"May 19, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d63e904ec0,18,697
"With how much love Naruto Shippuden gets—aside from maybe its final arc—I'm personally surprised the time skip (or Shippuden, as the anime calls it) isn’t criticized more for its actual issues. I’m not talking about the anime’s slow pacing and filler—that’s been talked about to death. I mean problems that were in the manga itself and just carried over into the anime. That said, I should be fair and explain my perspective—why I was disappointed, but also what I did like about Shippuden. In general, I prefer pre-time skip Naruto. Not only was the cast decently sized without feeling bloated, but the tone had a good mix of lightheartedness, magic, and actual strategy. However, due to the events of the Sasuke Retrieval Arc, it’s understandable that Shippuden lost much of its whimsical charm. Even the soundtrack feels more serious and somber. That’s one thing Shippuden does well—consistently emphasizing tragedy. And, oh boy, there’s a lot of it. While pre-time skip Naruto fumbled with who the real villains were from arc to arc, Shippuden at least has solid villain buildup. Almost every major conflict connects to a larger antagonist, which helps the story feel more cohesive. I also think Naruto (the character) himself improved. Pre-time skip Naruto had some nice moments but was generally a bit too annoying for me. Post-time skip, he’s more tolerable and has more memorable moments, though he can still be frustrating and occasionally bland. And while there aren’t as many as I’d like, Shippuden does have some great emotional moments. Some are tied to backstories, but a few present-day scenes stand out and keep things memorable. Unfortunately, that’s about where my positives end. One of my favorite things about pre-time skip Naruto was its balance of magic (ninjutsu) and strategy. Unfortunately, Shippuden gradually reduces the importance of ninja tactics, making fights feel like they’re decided purely by who has the strongest jutsu. Strategy occasionally appears, but it’s subtle—sometimes too subtle. This made many action scenes duller than they should have been. Sure, there are some cool set pieces and hard-hitting moments, but when everyone is just spamming super-powerful ninjutsu, and things like shuriken, bombs, and taijutsu barely matter (outside of that one insane Might Guy moment), it really shows how much power creep affected the fights. Even in pre-time skip Naruto, some characters were already being pushed to the background despite having cool designs or moments. Shippuden takes this issue and dials it up to 100. So many characters we got to emotionally connect with—or at least see do something cool—get shafted. Asuma, Kurenai, Choji, Shino, Anko, Rock Lee, Neji, Tenten—the list goes on. These were characters we got to know as early as the second arc, yet in Shippuden, they barely do anything. The only exceptions are a few obvious fan favorites like Shikamaru, Gaara, and I guess Hinata—but that’s about it. You’d think the Fourth Great Ninja War Arc would be the perfect time to make all these characters relevant again, and the series tried, but in my opinion, it fumbled hard. Why? Because there were too many characters introduced on top of an already large cast. Not only do we still have all the Leaf Village ninjas, but now we also have other village ninja, Kages, Tailed Beast hosts, Sasuke’s new Hebi allies, and temporary replacements for Sasuke and Kakashi in Team 7. With so many characters, most of them don’t get enough development to make us care about them beyond their base personality and powers. And sadly, that applies to the villains too. I do appreciate that the Akatsuki serve as Shippuden’s main antagonists. There was strong buildup for who should have been the final villain. But then there’s Kaguya. Without getting into spoilers, the lack of buildup for her is one of the most universally criticized aspects of Shippuden. There’s a bunch of nonsense about fate and reincarnation, and at this point, the ninja world’s reliance on magic becomes obnoxious. But honestly, Kaguya is just a symptom of a larger problem—Shippuden’s escalating power creep, which had been growing worse long before she even appeared. What’s probably the most disappointing for me is how Shippuden handled Team 7—the core reason the time skip even happened. By the end of pre-time skip Naruto, Sasuke’s character was already heading down a dark path. And let’s just say he becomes a lot more unlikable post-time skip. While there are good reasons for his descent, and some of it is due to certain characters withholding information from him, he still comes across as a moody, irrational mess. He constantly shifts his motives, becomes increasingly cruel, and gets way too much forgiveness for the terrible things he does. Then there’s Naruto and Sakura. They make so many dumb choices in their quest to “bring back"" Sasuke. I get that this is the heart of the story, but the way it plays out is exhausting. Watching Naruto and Sakura regress personality-wise just to make this happen was frustrating, and by the end, I didn’t even find their resolution satisfying. Their dynamic, which should have been a highlight of Shippuden, ended up being one of its biggest headaches. I honestly feel bad for Kakashi—he had to deal with a bunch of emotionally unstable teenagers who eventually gained god-like powers and affected the world because of some melodramatic love-friendship nonsense. Shippuden has its moments—a stronger, more somber tone, some cool fights, and a handful of emotional scenes. But the things it focused on just weren’t for me. The bloated cast, the increasingly dull fights, and the Team 7 drama made it a slog. And the slow pacing certainly didn’t help. I wish I could have enjoyed it more, but we got what we got.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_23f05a7b9d,18,5784
"Review 20: Naruto Shippuden (Our favourite hero grew up?)??? Well, well, well he's returned to our screens once again. But did he mature??? No Is he smarter??? No Did his brightly coloured strange outfit change at all??? NO Another fun loving Anime program following on from the original Naruto series. We see our favourite hero returning after 2 years training with his sensei. He's still loud and annoying, but for once everyones happy to see the demon child that is Naruto. Unfortunetly for his long time freinds he still poses that pervy, hot naked chick move which still freaks me out on a mild level. Well Sakuras still the same to!!! Apart from the fact she's turned into a mini Tsunade, once again creepy on a mild level. Turns out in the years Naruto was training he became a great healer just like Tsunade.We see in the early episodes of Naruto Shippuden that even Tsunade's training may not be enough for some forms of healing. Her appearence has changed ever so slightly,the clothes follow the same colour scheme and fashion from the previous episodes, but I thought she would start growing her hair again for Sasuke, but it seems the shorter look has stayed and will be there to stay for a while. Apart from this she's literally the same person, a few slight alterations inher wardrobe have not altered the fact that whenever Naruto goes off of task... She's there to hit him. (Obviously)... With enhanced graphics and a slightly older audience to watch this series of Naruto it seems perfectly normal to me to jump straight in like they have. You know, introducing new characters and meeting up with past members of the Naruto series. I have to say, I did start to watch the original Naruto series but became bored as i'd already read it. So I thought to fit back into the crowd I would start watching the series again. Good decsion for once. I do think this series is better than the original. I think the only reason I think its better is because, well they've grown up, so its as if people my age can relate to the characters that we love. It may seem weird but it is true. I know younger kids at my school who prefer the first series to Naruto Shippuden as they can relate to him and the situations he's in. I don't think Naruto's personality has matured or grown up with him. I think its the appearence and the voice that make him seem older. I actually like this element of Naruto as I prefer his characters to be this way, the series wouldn't be the same if he was smart and sophisticated 24/7. I'm glad with te decsion to keep him as a wacky nut job instead of a stuck up tight wod. I prefer the aged Naruto to the younger one who always wanged to become hokage. Therefore I prefer Naruto Shippuden to the original Naruto series. (Sorry to offend anyone)...

"You'll probably read a lot of reviews, good and bad, about Naruto Shippuden. Personally, I was glad that the old Naruto ended and we had a time skip to when they are teenagers (not that I didn't enjoy some aspects of the old one but that's a whole other review). Story: I like that they all have grown up a bit. You can tell some thought has been put into their characters now. Even Sakura (cringe) has developed characteristically some. Naruto isn't *totally* a blubbering idiot. After awhile it just gets annoying to see everyone whining and acting like the elementary kids they are modeled to be. The story has some darkness to it now. The Akatsuki are rampaging across the Ninja Lands. Everyone is forced to fight. I mean, it's becoming a more adult(ish) anime while still preserving funny parts. Of course, we'd love to skip the fillers if we could, but truthfully, a lot of my favorite episodes have been fillers. I think most of them (not all) are beneficial to developing the characters and, let's face it, it's just that many more episodes to look back on after Naruto is over for good. Art: I rated this a 7 because they can really change from awesome to... (well see certain scenes of the Pain arc). It just seems sometimes the ""good"" artists took a sick day or something when some episodes are being done. Sound: I love just about all of the opening and closing songs. They are usually fitting choices with the feel they seem to be going for at the time. Also, their sounds effects are average enough to not seem to noticeably out of place. The songs they use in the episodes are okay, it's just that they've used most of the same ones since the beginning of Naruto and, frankly, I'm getting tired of the recycling. I think the fans are worth looking up a few more pieces of music... Also, sometimes they play their ""epic"" song (I don't know these names I just know that they play this when Naruto starts to get hyped up about something) at random times. It usually causes a good laugh. Character: As I said before, I really like that things seem to be growing up more than before. It's hard to describe without spoilers, but it just seems to mature which is great. Enjoyment: I eagerly sign on every Thursday to check out the newest episode and watch it on the spot whether its a filler or not. I enjoy the show and I'll probably be following to the very end. Overall it's an 8 for me. It would be higher, but for the sheer mass of fillers, random sound issues, and sloppy artwork from time to time. I would like to add one last thing, though: I can deal with the fillers, but the thing that makes me want to punch my computer screen is the flashbacks. Flashbacks every four seconds usually. There was one recent episode (at the Summit) that was one giant flashback recapping ALL of the episodes including the original Naruto. My. God. I understand that we need some from time to time to refresh our memories, but it got to the point that I could start reciting parts of scenes because of the flashbacks. Biggest downside: flashbacks. Anyways, I'd still recommend this anime to anyone who asked. I think it's dumb not to give it a try just because it's popular. It's just as stupid to NOT do something because it's popular than to do it because it is.",8,Recommended,"Sep 22, 2011",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5b10564fb3,18,3264

"Undoubtedly the best shounen anime of all time (maybe bar one piece), and the long running show with the biggest fanbase is just a testament to how popular and good this series is. Naruto was my first anime (not counting pokemon) and still easily my favourite.I started this anime when i was a brat and watched another brat grow to the Hogake he's now. Everythings so awesome about naruto, that its hard to pick something and i have a very personal emotional attachment to naruto. With a vast world filled with jutsus and various techniques with awesome and unique character design for each character, breath taking fights where ur screaming and ur blood's boiling till it bursts, the moments that render u speechless, just the right amount of deaths (not too less or not to overdone like cough 'Akame ga kill'). and Naruto's character development is through the roof. This anime undoubtedly has the best villains overall, and the best villain anyways, with a backstories that make u sympathize with even Pain, who killed literally so many peeps (R.I.P. Pervy sage) and not to mention the most badass character ever, yes who else but the legendary Madara Uchiha. And the Kakashi Vs Obito, Madara Vs Guy, Naruto Vs Sasuke, every fight in Naruto has so much weight behind it, so much emotions behind them. The choreography is god tier. Naruto really set my bar for anime along with my bar for villains. The final showdown btw Naruto and Sasuke was very satisfying and exactly how a final fight's supposed to go down. There's still so much more i want to tell about Naruto but if this gets any bigger no one's gone read it.

"Everyone, regardless if one is an anime viewer or not, will know Naruto. It had been the highlight of Anime Industry for years now. It is known for the story and actually created a craze for anime in a lot of people, including me. But Shippuuden is rather plagued with Fillers. Story: 7 Kishimoto has done an amazing job, creating a story while taking enough time to develop characters. The story has its twists and turns and is able to grip you into it. There are a few inconsistency in the timeline, especially Itachi and Kakashi, mostly because these characters were over developed. Art: 5 The art is good but the quality of the animation depends heavily on the studio. It can go from hand drawn like lazy animation to the best 2D animations. The low score is especially because of lack of quality in fillers. Sound: 8 Intense and gripping. Character: 8 Well developed. Kishimoto has again, outdone himself in creating his characters. Each character grown in his own accord though secondary characters are quite just their parents replica and i expect it to be the same in Boruto, Enjoyment: 8 I have loved Naruto for more than half a decade now I can't give an uniased opinion unless it is about the fillers.

"The obvious complaint is probably clear for anyone who has seen the show: filler. Good lord, there is a lot. At first I was fine with it, because it was the first anime I watched, and I watched a lot. Before I found Crunchyroll, I would google _________ vs _________ and watch the fight scenes, which would be 90 minutes long and 20 minutes of actual combat. But again, I was fine with that, even when I started to watch the series in order. Then I branched out to other anime that I saw on tumblr: Attack on Titan, Fairy Tail, and KnK to name a few. I was FLOORED the first time I watched AoT because of how much story they crammed into each episode. One episode of AoT was equal to seven episodes of Naruto. It's not even for story purposes; half of the Naruto filler is people glaring angrily at each other from across the battlefield. Plus, do you really want to watch seven episodes of the main character trying to rip a leaf for training? Another thing that I was not a fan of in Naruto was the amount of dues ex machinima they used during the battles. Just when a character seemed totally screwed, he would suddenly unveil a secret Jutsu that he/she cast twenty minutes before. It was like the writers put themselves in a corner every battle and had to create a miracle to save the plot. The soundtrack is amazing though, and it can give one goosebumps. The art is good, with sweeping landscaped and the collateral damage from the battles would show, which I thought showed a good attention to detail. Some characters you'll hate, others you'll love, and that's a good thing. The character development is nice, although the pacing can be shotty sometimes, and characters may disappear for weeks in-show. While this is a cornerstone in the anime world, and I do enjoy it a lot and would recommend it, I have to say there are substantially better animes out there. One good thing is that this show is not terribly far behind the manga, but that also is the cause of all the filler. Maybe, if this series was 150 episodes instead of 345 (as of this review), which would've been very doable, I would give this a 10.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 4, 2014",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_116d0abf8c,18,2118

"So this is not going to be a long review. Naruto is one of the most beloved manga, and it is noy hard to understand why. The setting is unique and the characters are very intresting. But in Shippuden all the elements that made part 1 unique are lost after a certain point. The fillers are too many making about 40 % of the series and the final arc is boring and full of plotholes. Now it might have stumbed a bit in the final arc but the ending is where it truly failed. Extremely important plotpoints are left unresolved and brushed aside and the characters lose their essence. It basically feels like you are watching strangers, which can be painful especially if you have come to love the characters and mainly the protagonist Naruto Uzumaki who loses all of the qualities that made him lovable among the audiences.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 21, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2b88acf47c,18,818
"strong points + best thing about naruto has got to be the characters. naruto, itachi, jiraiya, these are just some of the few examples of profoundly impactful characters that have etched a deep impression onto its viewers and caused viewers to be extremely emotionally attached to them and whatever they may experience throughout the story + although not particularly sophisticated and intellectual to the likes of Death Note and Code Geass, naruto's story and universe in general are still very comprehensive and feel very immersive for the viewer + the use of music is very focused and adds heavily onto the atmosphere as and when appropriate, changing the mood and tone as it goes along. + many of the fight scenes that happen are very well thought out where characters do interesting things to try to outsmart their opponents or work together effectively to form a better strategy, generally applies for most fights weak points - of course the major criticism naruto gets is the insane amount of filler material/flashbacks present (almost 40% of the 500 episodes) and while this definitely prevents naruto from being a straight 9/10 due to the repetitiveness and loss of impact from overusing fillers, there is a filler guide available people use it as necessary - naturally, naruto's art and animations are not particularly the best. some character's faces and fight scenes in general are poorly animated (e.g. naruto vs pain) although generally they are good enough to go buy most of the time. don't expect anything close to violet evergarden or anything like that - naruto's pacing can be questionable at times, although this applies more exclusively for earlier seasons. from less important events being explored heavily to extremely draggy fight scenes, these are some of the issues with pacing. once again however, not a very big issue for the most part of naruto especially if you follow the filler guide at the end of the day, naruto is still one of the best big-ticket mainstream animes out there with a really comprehensive universe and some of the most impactful characters out there.",8,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d4f46c4471,18,2099

That they were always exposed to Destruction, as one that stands or walks in slippery Places is always exposed to fall. This is implied in the Manner of their Destruction’s coming upon them, being represented by their Foot’s sliding. The same is express’d, Psal. 73. 18. Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction. 2. It implies that they were always exposed to sudden unexpected Destruction. As he that walks in slippery Places is every Moment liable to fall; he can’t foresee one Moment whether he shall stand or fall the next; and when he does fall, he falls at once, without Warning. Which is also expressed in that, Psal. 73. 18, 19. Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places; thou castedst them down into Destruction. How are they brought into Desolation as in a Moment? 3. Another Thing implied is that they are liable to fall of themselves, without being thrown down by the Hand of another. As he that stands or walks on slippery Ground, needs nothing but his own Weight to throw him down. 4. That the Reason why they are not fallen already, and don’t fall now, is only that God’s appointed Time is not come. For it is said, that when that due Time, or appointed Time comes, their Foot shall slide. Then they shall be left to fall as they are inclined by their own Weight. God won’t hold them up in these slippery Places any longer, but will let them go; and then, at that very Instant, they shall fall into Destruction; as he that stands in such slippery declining Ground on the Edge of a Pit that he can’t stand alone, when he is let go he immediately falls and is lost.

"I've finally finished Shippuden. I don't use the word finally to suggest the show was a drag, yes, it had it's up and downs, rather stratospheric up's and mind numbing downs to be frank, but on the whole it was an exciting, riveting, wholesome and heartbreaking experience I am very glad I finally got round to watching. I'm here not really sure what to write. So much has been written about Shippuden that this review won't really add anything to the thousands of reviews that have come before but nevertheless, here we go. I normally break up my reviews into 3 key parts; Story, Animation and music though I'm not sure that would really do this 500 ep show the justice it deserves so I'll separate the story into some of the key character's stories instead. Firstly, Ill cover the animation. Its really hard to say anything bad about the animation here. Naruto doesn't really lend itself to the over the top animated fight sequences compared to other shounen, simply because of how the characters fight and the usage of Ninjutsu. There were many times I was begging for some over the top moments but I can now safely say, when appreciated without my expectations, at worst the animation does exactly what it needs to, at best it's beautiful. Where the animation shines is in the hand to hand combat. I can't name specific fights here as it would have result in spoilers but it is safe to say they are stunning to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are some Ninjutsu based fights that are equally stunning, but I think it's safe to say that the fights in Shippuden have animation take a back seat to narrative, and what a narrative it is, I'll come to that later though. All in all, as I said above, at worst, the animation does exactly what is required of it and I wouldn't want it to change. I don't believe the animation needed to be more intense or mind-blowing, despite it not being either of these two things, I believe it is perfect for the show I would give it a 9/10. Moving on to the music. Personally, it's perfect. 10/10. The choices is music fit literally everything perfectly. Moments of stress building are have their own motif, moments of heartbreak have their own motif, moments of joy have their own motif and moments of saying goodbye the same. In between these recurring themes are subtle background sounds that deliver a true score experience. Some of the key standouts from the music are; Sadness and Sorrow, Martyr, Loneliness and my goodness, Experienced Many Battles borrows to my soul. Ill be honest, Ive named some here, but there are all perfect. I know the show is fresh in my mind, but with every passing second of these songs, I can hear vividly the characters, I can see the moments and if you take a look of the comments on YouTube to any of these songs you will see endless comparable remarks like mine. The music is not only stunning, but it has a way of replaying the moments in your mind with such vivid quality and floods your entire body with the accompanying emotions Shippuden delivers so beautifully. I watched this show when it was long finished, and it already resides within me emotionally, so much so that the smallest note can bring up the wonder of parts of this show. I can only imagine the connection and deep love people who watched this being released must feel for this show. I can imagine the music simultaneously breaks, repairs and embraces their hearts all at the same time. The music of Naruto is phenomenal. If you have finished the show and disagree, go here -https://youtu.be/kgaUXbOdbck?si=2330Rq_kUibM4fSF. I would put money on it that you change your mind very quickly. Its not until you hear the music outside of the show that it really hits you and you truly realise it's a masterpiece of an OST. Now I've got myself all emotional, what better thing is their to talk about next other than the characters and story.....here we go.....One thing this show does unbelievably well is emotion. It is within every single second. Whether that be love, sadness, forgiveness, anger, every emotion is perfectly conveyed. I would also like to point out that everything up to episodes around the 400 mark are 10/10. I found that within the episodes of 400 to 500, it's full of flashbacks, some you have seen multiple times by this point and it really starts to drag a little bit. So with this in mind, Shippuden is not a perfect show, but I would still give it a 9/10. Considering how many episodes there are, this is an incredible feat. Above, is the only real negative thing I have to say about the story really, so with that in mind I want to mention some characters. Jiraiya - for me, Jiraiya is everything to this anime. He is the rock for Naruto, he provides the perfect level of comic relief at time and ultimately in integral to most of the story's progression. Jiraiya plays such a fundamental role to this show that there is very little I can say here without spoiling something. There is so much I would want to say about this guy. One thing I will say is that Jiraiya will give you some of the best character driven arcs of any anime. He is in one of the best of Shippuden (The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant) and is the undying flame behind possibly the greatest story arc ever written (Pain's Assault). Jiraiya is one of my favourite characters in this show and will likely be yours. Itachi - Speaking of the two arcs above, smack bang in the middle of them is Fated Battle Between Brothers. One thing is for certain, I can say absolutely nothing about this. Only that this changes everything. Itachi is such a superb antagonist. His mere appearance causes fear for anyone in his presence. He really is a fascinating character. Sadly however, I can say no more about him specifically. What I can say is there are some truly beautiful moments with Itachi involved and equally moments of excitement. He is involved in one of the greatest fights of the entire show and he deserves it. Sasuke - now, I can't say I have the same fondness for Sasuke as I do for the first two mentioned. I believe that he is a missed opportunity in this show. His character delivers very little for me. The only thing positive Sasuke adds is the fact that Naruto wants to bring him back to the Leaf. That's it for me. Most of the arcs he is part of are either rather boring or his part in the exciting arcs is boring. Also, he's just an unlikely character and I don't think it's down to purposeful writing. Good writing of an unlikely characters makes you enjoy not liking someone. Sasuke for me, is just unlikable and most of the time when he appears on screen, I want it to be over sooner rather than later. Pain - Ok, setting Sasuke to one side who is the only character is don't like, I'll talk about the perfect antagonist that is Pain. There is nothing about pain that is badly written. Every flashback, every line, every movement is perfect and yes, he is the key antagonist in Pain's Assault arc and what an arc it is. Most of you time you are just sat, mouth open in shock, or eyes flooded with tears through sadness or happiness. The characters writing of Pain is the best the show has, and this show has so many great characters I won't talk about. Pain is perfection and truly encapsulates the word itself. Again, I won't go into the content of the arc itself as it is so important not to know a thing going into this show but trust me, Pain and this arc is a masterpiece. Naruto - finally Naruto. Its really hard to put into words the journey this fool takes you on. I have laughed out loud, I have cried out loud, I have been heartbroken, warmed to the soul and been happy to continue with his every step of the way. Most characters develop over time, the character development in the show is superb, Naruto has it all from the beginning. Difference with Naruto is one layer of emotion is shown at certain times and covered back up when required. As far as protagonists go, he's is up their with Luffy. I'm sure there will be some One Piece elitists that disagree but his is and that's the end of it. The twists and turns Naruto has to go through is honestly and incredible ride and he also has the most emotional moments of the show, and they really are emotional. He is superb All in all this show is superb. All in all it's a very strong 9/10 for me. As I said at the top, 9/10 for a show with 500 episodes is quite the achievement. Shippuden is a must watch as far as I am concerned, a show with little flaws and moments that you will remember for the rest of your life.",9,Recommended,"Nov 28, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_5c319a5eb7,19,8528
"Naruto Classic is good, and Shippuden starts well and remains acceptable until Pain's arc, after that it's just downhill. from there, Shippuden takes everything that was presented in the classic and throws it in the trash, remember the charismatic characters of the classic? forget everything, what matters here is only Naruto and Sasuke. Remember that Naruto story that ""there is no destiny"" and that ""he makes his own destiny""? Forget it, Naruto is now the child of Ashura's prophecy and reincarnation. The Arc of War is one of the worst things ever done, too much trouble, screen time for characters that didn't matter at all for that part of the story, and LOTS of filler during the war, and if that weren't enough, there are even flashbacks in all episodes, a problem that has been around since classic Naruto. The animation worsens with each episode and the end of the war, come on, the final villain is an ALIENIGINE without any development that emerged FROM NOTHING in history and was defeated by a JUTSU HARÉM. Anyway, very bad, it's just not a complete crap, because it has Pain's arc which is good. I do not recommend",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 30, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_858b9d6c05,19,1128
"Naruto Shippuden is one of the most overrated anime I've seen. While it has a massive fanbase and a few unforgettable moments, the overall quality—especially the story—is weak at best. Let’s get this straight: the story is a mess. After the Pain arc and some decent world-building, it completely collapses. The war arc is bloated, filled with recycled flashbacks and dragged-out fights. The final Naruto vs Sasuke fight, which should’ve been the emotional climax of the entire series, felt lazy, forced, and anticlimactic. It had none of the depth it promised. I’d give the story a 1/10—purely because it had potential that it never delivered on. Now about the main character: Naruto himself is one of the most underwhelming protagonists in anime history. His entire character gets reduced to “talk no jutsu” and blind optimism. He rarely shows depth, complexity, or real emotional growth after a certain point. Ironically, his best fight probably isn’t even in this anime—it's in Boruto, where we finally see a more grounded, matured version of him. Despite all that, the character writing isn't completely hopeless. Shikamaru, Itachi, Jiraia and Kakashi are easily some of the best-written characters in anime, period. Their backstories, motivations, and emotional arcs are incredibly well done. Honestly, they carried the show. If the whole anime was written with their level of depth, Naruto Shippuden could’ve been on a completely different level. Animation is hit or miss. Some major fights look amazing, like Pain vs Naruto or Kakashi vs Obito, but outside of those, a lot of the animation looks dated or just plain bad in slower episodes. So I’d give it a 7/10, considering the time it aired. One major issue: filler. There’s way too much. Over 200 episodes of pure filler or poorly timed flashbacks completely ruin the pacing. Nothing kills hype like being thrown into a 5-episode childhood recap during a war. Final thoughts: A few legendary characters and fights aren’t enough to save Naruto Shippuden from weak storytelling, a bland main character, and a pacing disaster. Watch it for the highlights, skip the rest.

"Naruto is for anime what Taylor Swift is for pop music: it divides opinions, definitely overrated in some aspects but it's something you should check if this is your thing. Naruto, despite its plot holes and misconstructed characters, is a story that's both too big to just end but too unique to have a satisfatory sequel. I'll forever keep it in my heart along with the strong feelings I had while watching. You'll watch someone's growth and I'm sure it will inspire you in some way, no matter where you are in life. I say this because I've been a fan for more than a decade and, although the things I like about the series and how I like them have changed, it's still very dear to me. I really reccomend watching it fully. Yes, with the fillers. Some are really boring, I must admit. But most of them show sides of the characters, especially the side ones, you wouldn't see otherwise. Not to mention the comic relief. There's no reason to rush into it so just enjoy it at your pace and I'm sure you'll be touched by this beautiful story. Now, it's definitely a shame that so much happened for this to culminate in Boruto but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",8,Recommended,"Dec 31, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_64a2813880,19,1136
"Wow, what an anime. So happy I watched this as one of my firsts as it has inspired me to watch so much more. It also inspired me to work out and better myself as the main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is an untalented outcast in the hidden leaf. He works harder than anyone and doesn't allow any negative opinions to enter his head. By far, one of the most likeable main characters in fiction as you only want the best for him. Aswell as the mc, the side cast is as much likeable. Shikamaru, kakashi and pervy sage (jiraiya) are incredibly encapturing and Pull you in when they're on screen. The deutaragonist, sasuke uchiha, leaves the village and is definitely one of the best parts of the show. His main goal is to kill his older brother, itachi uchiha, who slaughtered his clan. Overall I gave this anime a 9, so inspiring, many amazing characters, world building and a near perfect story. This anime is long but I recommend it to everyone.

"I started watching anime with Naruto. The story itself is very interesting and well made, at first I wasn't that so into it since I saw there were 300+ episodes (although a bunch of them are fillers) but as I started watching I got easily caught up in it. This anime makes you feel compassion, friendship and closure to the characters in it, the animation isn't the best but the series itself is pretty «old» so I think that's normal and not a crucial negative point. Each character has its individual story/development and their importance in the series. For example, one of the best side character of this whole anime is Shikamaru. The way his story was written and incorporated in the anime is amazing, definitely one of my favorites. As someone who started watching anime with Naruto, I would recommend the series to others also interested in starting.",10,Recommended,"Mar 5, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_33f25a8f92,19,856
"Watching this series, worth watching, liked its minimalistic graphics and action. It has a great story and very unpredictable. I have started playing its game too. You can download it from here https://apkbeyond.com Uniqueness: While Naruto incorporates many elements commonly found in the shonen genre, such as epic battles, character growth, and a coming-of-age story, it also introduces several unique concepts and a vast world filled with ninjas, complex political dynamics, and intricate lore. Naruto's journey from an underdog to a powerful ninja, as well as the exploration of themes like friendship, destiny, and the pursuit of peace, contribute to its distinctiveness. Predictability and enjoyment: While certain aspects of Naruto's plot may be predictable at times, especially in terms of character development and certain story arcs, it remains a highly enjoyable series for many fans. The emotional depth, well-choreographed fights, and compelling character interactions often outweigh any predictability, especially for viewers who are fans of the shonen genre and appreciate the familiar tropes and setups it offers. Art style: Naruto's art style is fitting for the story it tells. The character designs are distinctive, and the action sequences are fluidly animated, showcasing the intensity of the battles. The use of vibrant colors and visually appealing landscapes adds to the overall aesthetic and complements the energetic nature of the series. Well-rounded characters: Naruto features a wide range of characters, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and flaws. The main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is initially portrayed as an impulsive and brash individual, but as the story progresses, he matures and develops into a more thoughtful and empathetic leader. Similarly, other characters undergo significant growth, facing personal challenges and overcoming their flaws, making them relatable and multi-dimensional. Realistic reactions: While Naruto is set in a fictional world, the characters generally react to situations and events in a realistic manner, considering the circumstances they find themselves in. Their emotions, motivations, and actions are often driven by personal experiences, aspirations, and the complex relationships they have with one another. However, it's worth noting that certain exaggerated elements, such as over-the-top battles and supernatural abilities, may deviate from strict realism, which is common in the shonen genre. Enjoyment by others: Naruto has amassed a large and dedicated fanbase worldwide, and many people have found great enjoyment in the series. However, like any form of media, personal preferences can vary, and some individuals may not resonate with Naruto's storytelling or genre conventions. Factors such as personal taste, familiarity with shonen anime, and interest in themes explored in the series, such as friendship and personal growth, can influence whether someone will enjoy or dislike it. Overall, Naruto's blend of compelling characters, emotional storytelling, epic battles, and its exploration of universal themes has garnered widespread acclaim and popularity. While it may not be universally loved by everyone, its appeal to a broad audience suggests that many viewers will find it enjoyable.",9,Recommended,"May 19, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c335c8c7e1,19,3291
"What can one even write in a review for a show where youve watched 700 episodes. No words are enough really. Ofcourse theres also the point its split into two parts. Im just gonna do a small review for each. Naruto : Starts off a little slow. You have to endure the usual goofy Shounen humour. Sillyness. Pacing. Picks up the the Chuunin exam which is maybe the best tournament/exam arc of all time for me. That was the first time i started to feel it with Naruto and im gonna enjoy this long journey. Music is great. Tons of great openings. Some great fights. Rock Lee vs Gaara remains my all time favorite. The show continues to be great with the usual slowdons with some shorter fillers and boring recaps/slow pacing. Only to end with a HUGE filler end which bored me to death and i had to endure to get through and questioning if Naruto is gonna be wirth it. Ruined it a bit why i lowered it to 8/10. Shippuden : This is the big one. Where things finally start to happen. Coming from a long boring filler end i feel Shippuden went straight to the good stuff with Akatsuki and his nine tails origin. Soundtrack gets even better and so does the openings/Endings. Closer and Silhouette two of the best openings there are. The plot, with all its parts about Narutos backstory, the Ninja worlds origin, and all the important characters is incredible. The only letdown is the usual stuff. Some boring Shounen ”humor” Mostly weak female cast. And again way to much fillers. This time its more spread out. But this also means more interruptions. Not the ling boring endurance bit more annoying pace issues/interruptions because of it. Shippuden was the stronger part though since the original OST was greatly expanded and better, openings/endings likewise, plus tge greatly expanded plot and lore about the world and how it all connects and comes together to form an epic ninja tale. Why this part get tge higher 9/10. Overall: An experience and journey that is a must for people interested in the medium. A remarkable achievement despite its small flaws.",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_551c67b78a,19,2051
"Naruto was my first anime, and it’s more than just a show—it’s an emotion. It taught me about pain, friendship, and what it means to keep going even when the world’s against you. The story has classic themes, but it never feels boring because of how deep and personal it gets. The art style fits perfectly with the emotional moments and intense battles. The characters feel real, flawed, stubborn, and full of growth. Naruto inspired me in so many ways, and watching him grow felt like growing with him. And honestly, the villains? Some of the coolest and most badass ever. Pain, Itachi, Madara—they’re not just evil, they’re deep, complex, and unforgettable. Even if you see some things coming, it doesn’t matter—you feel everything. Naruto will always have a place in my heart.",9,Recommended,"Jul 10, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_13d8fac07b,19,779
"After 1 week after the end of Naruto a new series Began named Naruto Shippuden, it s the sequel of the previous anime named Naruto, that takes place after 2 years of naruto training with Jirayia The story is by far one of the best out there in the Anime World, that will make you cry several times, after you begin the series you can't stop watching episodes that's how good the story is, the story is good but the fillers make this more enjoyable. The art stands by personal opinions but i think the art did a prety good job for me as i enjoyed the art i'm gonna give it an 8. Well the sound is on another level, only the songs make you cry, the songs feel alive and they make you fell the character entire story with them a very well maded songs that caracterizize the character well i'll give it an 10 Well the Character are also pretty well designed that have an clear ambition, that they want to get stronger, to protect their friends,but they are pretty bad written characters too, one of the best character developments it s Itachi his story is far on another level, you had to cry at least 1 time when you heard his story. Well i enjoyed the serries pretty much but he has too many fillers and i think the level could be reduced because they are like 40% of the series hope the kai version comes out.

"anyone would know this anime. This anime already has many fans in the world. the Naruto Shippuden series is a continuation of Little Naruto. Many changes appear in Naruto Shippuden, namely improved graphics, storylines that turn out to be more exciting, new jutsu jutsu that appear, and the appearance of Akatsuki that makes the story more interesting and exciting. In Naruto Shippuden there are also many epic moments and exciting and exciting battles. character building is also getting stronger, especially the main character, Uzumaki Naruto. In this anime, the role of Uchiha Sasuke is also getting cooler and more epic. the added value of Naruto Shippuden is the backsound of each scene is very appropriate to the moment, especially sad scenes, very touching. moreover, plus an exciting fight with a long duration is very interesting to watch. the biggest shortcoming of this anime is too many FILLERS. again the filler problem occurs again in the anime Naruto Shippuden, after the previous series there were also many fillers. many fillers are not important in Naruto Shippuden. but there are also interesting filler episodes that still connect to the main story. I know the filler is made so that the anime is not overtaken by the manga. Now Naruto Shippuden has finished, and filler is not too much of a problem. Naruto Shippuden is finished with the happy ending story. Naruto is married to Hinata, and life becomes peaceful. Naruto is my favorite action anime and will not be replaced by other anime, because this anime has become a legend for me. especially Naruto Shippuden whose storyline changes dramatically, becoming more exciting. I am a big fan of Naruto anime and Naruto Shippuden anime, and also Boruto anime. maybe if Naruto Shippuden has a little filler, then this anime rating will definitely be high, even in my opinion it can be up to 9, because this anime is very popular in the world and has many fans, and has a very exciting story.",9,Recommended,"Aug 3, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_43e4d8ddb3,19,1960
"Disclaimer: My review is purely based on the cannon episodes of Shippuden. I did not watch the filler. Naruto Shippuden is a very emotional character-driven story, and that's why I love it. Sure, it has an out-of-this-world story, with some pretty insane powers (though I do think that this is part of the anime's charm), but it's mainly the characters that carry the show. They are some of the most memorable, well-designed, iconic, and interesting characters in anime history if you ask me. Shippuden is also great from a technical standpoint. My mind is blown at how consistently fantastic, beautiful, and effective the music is. The soundtrack has its own personality, and never fails in setting the mood for any given scene. The OPs and most of the EDs are also pretty unforgettable. While Shippuden certainly has many instances of subpar animation and art, there are also many instances of absolutely phenomenal art and fight choreography that are well worth the wait. My only real issue is with one of the last arcs of the anime. I won't get into spoilers, but I thought it was, hands-down, the worst written cannon arc in all of Shippuden. This fact made the victory of that arc feel less deserved and a little hollow. That being said, the anime does end on a beautiful high note. As a whole, this anime is profoundly memorable. Because of that, I can forgive the aforementioned poorly written arc. This was a wonderful anime, and deciding to watch it from the beginning was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",9,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f1d6c5e87b,19,1524
"If the whole anime was like Pain's arc, it would score 9, but the first arcs are pretty boring to watch and Ninja War is easily one of the worst anime arcs around, and the anime simply abandoned all the good characters from the Classic to focus on the beast drama between Naruto and Sasuke, besides having introduced several interesting characters throughout the plot but that didn't do any good in the end, and even characters that were initially well written like Obito, were spoiled in the end with the classic Discourse no Jutsu. One thing that also bothers me is the fact that they haven't explored almost anything in Naruto's universe apart from Konoha, and even in Konoha some things were left out like that political arc right after Itachi's death.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 12, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_9eaa63c000,19,756
"Extremely stretched without any valid reasons. Let me start with this , Naruto is a extremely good series and a piece of work which will make you fall in in love with this medium (anime) but only if you watch it when you are new to anime , Naruto was my 3rd anime and watching it felt so good that i binged naruto and naruto shippuuden withing 25 days but then slowly slowly i started watching more and more anime and after a certain time when i thought back about naruto i simply started feeling that this is nothing special and is simply overrated (which is pretty understandable) and unnecessarily stretched. There are other shows which people say are copied from naruto like black clover and even jujutsu kaisen but here is the thing, these shows actually did everything right which naruto didnt and they didnt give us 200 fillers neither did they stretched the story for a decade. I did rate the series a long time back and i dont intend to change the score because at that time i actually enjoyed the series a lot but if i have watch it again then i would say i will give it a 6 out of 10. other than that naruto has played a very crucial role in increasing the popularity of anime across the world so it actually do deserve credit for that.",8,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a4c0cf3b52,19,1247
"This is my first time writing a review but i will try my best. Well so first what i wanna say that since everyone tastes are different so some people might not agree with me. But its okay. Naruto is a good anime. Many people hates it and many people loves some people think that this anime is average. But i actually like it. I talk about two things here that's the negatives and the positives and at the end of the review a final verdict for it. First a quick summary. I will try my best not to give any spoilers. [size=90]summary[/size] :- The main character is Naruto Uzumaki. And the story is simple he wants to be the leader of his village means hokage because he wants the villagers to recognise him. Everyone in his village thinks he is a monster and see him as nothing but a brat. Story:- Well Naruto is an overall good anime. For me its one of my top anime i ever watched. It was my first anime too. I already wrote the quick summary of it so you now have a bit of knowledge for it. The best thing i found about Naruto was the enjoyment. The enjoyment it gave me no other anime entertained me that much. It has its own positives and negatives i can't deny that. I found the story of it quite simple but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't say that it has the best storytelling but its still good many other anime does this better. Some people complain about the flashbacks well True but i think flashbacks are necessary here. The story is connected with their flashbacks there are character who has their own tragic backstory and if you want to understand them you have to watch the flashbacks it goes for villains too and why the villains became villain you need to know their backstory and than you will understand the story that's how the story was created theres a villain (antagonist) behind a villain. And that villain is the one who made the other villain a villain well it cofuse right but that's what it is you will know that when you watch the anime. I found almost every flashbacks good my favourite are [spoiler]Itachi's and sasuke's [/spoiler] story. Other flashbacks were also good but i felt a bit bored in [spoiler] obito's[/spoiler] backstory but it was still good because he was one of the villains. You might say what connection does the main story have with flashbacks like i said before if you want to understand the maim Story you need to watch the backstory. Every backstory connects with the main story the same goes for the main character he has a backstory too. Character:- Well characters are not great but still they are good there is a lot of characters but all of them doesn't get enough screen time and one of the main secondary characters is pretty useless and was almost the whole series but became a bit useful at the end of the story the same goes for others all of them has decent character development. But i didn't focus on the secondary characters that much because i didn't think that was necessary if i know the main story and female characters many people says the female character were annoying maybe some of them but i didn't find them annoying or entertaining they just weren't boring. But when it comes to the main characters they were great and entertaining Sounds:- Sounds were decent except for some OST's and OP, ED some of them are my all time favourites. Animation:- The animation was good. I won't say that it was great and top tier. Because Naruto never fucused on animation it was action anime so the fight were absolutely one of the best in all of anime. Positive:- The positives are its fighting. And the overall enjoyment. Its doesn't have the best animation or the best sounds well hear me out first its sounds aren't the best but they great. But it did good at what it should its fighting the fightings are easily top tier nobody can deny. The characters are overall good and i think you will enjoy almost every main secondary characters except one because she was useless almost the entire story. But others are great and their personality too. Negatives:- Well it has a decent amount of negatives too. Its fillers and its flashbacks also the amount of time the other characters get. It has good amount of fillers but if you don't wanna watch it than just skip them if you are like me who only cares about the main story than you can skip it. Now the flashbacks well yeah as i said before you won't quite understand the main story if you skip the flashbacks more importantly the antagonists. Almost every antagonists have their flashbacks and the flashbacks shows why the turned villain. And the flashbacks are connected to the main story. If you skip the flashbacks than at the end of the story you might think why did this villain did this and you might won't understand some of parts of the main story. It has some plot holes too but if i talk about it than i have to give spoilers so that's entirely a different thing. And for the characters just don't care about them. Final Verdict:- After reading all of this you might say that why did i rated it as 10/10. Well true. But that's because enjoyment. I never watched any anime that gave me as much enjoyment as Naruto. I watched Hunter x Hunter and Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood. Hunter x Hunter has better power system than Naruto and a better storytelling too. Fullmetal alchemist brotherhood has a better storytelling than naruto. But all of them are nothing compared to Naruto when i think of enjoyments. Maybe im being biased here. Since Naruto was the first anime ever watched so its nostalgic. But im a person who cares about personal enjoyment over anything else. Because of the enjoyment i never noticed all of the other negatives and mistakes. Some people also compare about the fact that sometimes Naruto talks with antagonists, tell them that what they are doing is bad the shouldn't do it and nicknamed this as talk no jutsu. I didn't care about this actually because i don't care about such if it was entertaining 😅. If you are someone like me who only cares about the main story then skip the fillers. Some people might not have same opinions and tastes as mine but that's okay. That was all i had to say. Hope you enjoyed stay frosty. For alternative recommendation:- Watch bleach, Hunter x Hunter. So that was all i had to say guys. It might be a bit big. But i had to make it big to tell you the reason's why i like this show. It was my first review so i hope you enjoyed this.

"this show is just overhyped, it went from talking about ninjas, to talking about how the main character can completely change a character personality just from talking. I still can't find the why to all of the 10/10 reviews when it doesn't even come close to that: the story degenerates and it quickly switches focus on fighting, the art is pretty decent you can't complain much about it, some characters receive less than 15 minutes of screentime and the series itself is 2/3 filler and most of the filler itself is just boring. what can i say, just another overhyped series.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 23, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_7471ea406d,19,576
if only there were less filler episodes it would have been better. The fillers made original story to drag out. I think that Naruto should have spent little more time with his parents. It has one of the most emotional scenes in my opinion which is his goodbye to his father's spirit. Overall it was an enjoyable ang nostalgic anime. Hence they shouldn't have ruined it's legacy by making a crap boruto. a n d n o w i h a v e t o w r i t e t h i s l o n g c a u s e m a l w o u l d n o t a l l o w m e t o p o s t a r e v i e w,9,Recommended,"Jul 29, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_87ad7f305c,19,526

The best anime after naruto is naruto shippuden. Yes as it tells u about betrayals like who betrayed konohagakure no sato (Hidden leaf village) it also shows about itachi and sasuke(i am not giving spoilers) it gives the secrets as if u know in the prequel naruto and doesn't know his parents. It even shows about gaara and naruto which i like absolutely. So i give it a full 100/100. It even shows things which are nice. The only thing i dont like is why did the makers make naruto almost bald in later episodes he dosent look nice. I would prefer his hairstyle like minato which looks so much nice and if he would get uzumaki strength with namizaki also if would be nice.

"Ignoring the filler and focusing on the main story, it is a pretty decent anime. The writing on the villains was compelling but pretty much every moral struggle that any of them had was exactly the same, the talk no jutsu meme. The characters are generally interesting and likable but non of them have any character development. Most characters are exactly the same when the show ends as when the show starts, just with slightly more context. It quite literally takes to the last canon episode for Sasuke to stop being a douche, which is saying a lot. The fight choreography was really good for important fights but lackluster for anything in between, so good on average. The show for me was a good gateway into anime but after rewatching it recently, I found that it isn't as good as I remembered and is definitely overhyped. I compare it to Star Wars where most of the content is mediocre but it creates a universe and deep lore that is very interesting and worth keeping up with.",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 23, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_bec55e431e,20,982

"Naruto: Shippuden was a good sequel. It provided something for Naruto fans to look forward to every week for about ten years. By the end, the viewers seemingly parted with their favourites for one last time... and then Boruto was announced almost in the same week. This, once again, was a source of nostalgia for those who grew up with it, and once again, was a complex show with tons of let-downs for many who did not start off their consumption of narrative media with Naruto. The first arc is probably better than the entirety of the prequel series (that's just a joke, it was just better than the mediocrity that so predominantly plagued Naruto). The Akatsuki was finally assembled, the fabled foes were finally pitted against our protagonists. Deidara was one of the most fun characters while he was on screen, as he always had some way to escape the dire situation he was in. Naruto had matured for good, and was much more likeable as a protagonist. The arc was great in almost its entirety, and most of the flaws were not majorly visible. Sai was a great character, and served his purpose as a replacement for Sasuke in the second arc. Naruto's efforts and training were apparently coming to fruition, as they were finally about to meet Sasuke... only for him to overpower Naruto's entire team and leave with the stated intention of never coming back. Hidan and Kakuzu were interesting villains, with both having valid reasons for joining the Akatsuki. Their fights were well-choreographed, and their powers were well explained and well thought out. The whole arc detailing Jiraiya's past with the Third Shinobi War, the search for Itachi on both sides, and the build up toward the introduction of Amegakure, Pain and Konan was astonishing to watch. Each scene of importance felt like a historical retelling, a story from the long gone past. There were many ups, there were rare downs, there were complex characters, and there were heartbreaking events. This, along with Pain's assault on the Hidden Leaf Village, Killer Bee's introduction, and the declaration of war at the Assembly of the Kage, were arguably the best parts of the story. These arcs were where the story and its author, Masashi Kishimoto, were truly allowed to shine, to use characters they had built up, introduce new and interesting characters, and progress the plot properly. Almost every part of the story up until then was great to watch. Then the Fourth Shinobi War started. At the beginning, it was built up as the greatest arc in the series yet. Every action in the preceding 400-something episodes (from both the prequel and Shippuden) had come to some sort of satisfying conclusion in the form of this massive conflict. The war was great to watch from all sides, as it felt like a story that would be told for centuries to come. Everything seemed to be going right : the previous Kage made an appearance, Madara was a great villain, and the true nature of the events up until now was revealed. All seemed to be going well : fillers, while predominant, did not take much from the show in terms of quality, and the story was great, to say the least. And then the show kept on going, stretching the War arc with one twist after another. The first few were anticipated, but as the arc went on, it got much more random. Another flaw the show had was that, even as time evolved, it made barely any effort to evolve its animation and colour pallette till the last arc. Much of it was bland rather than dark, and many scenes were slow in terms of both movement and dialogue. And right in the middle, for no reason, was just a random 7-episode Itachi backstory, adapted from a series of light novels not even written by the original author. Where the show truly lost me, and many other viewers, was the introduction of Kaguya. Her story was sad, but her motivations made no sense, and she seemed to exist purely to conclude the series as a whole. Madara was put out of commission without any warning, and for no reason, and most of the power-ups were done for plot convenience, since the protagonists had had enough of losing. The show managed to somewhat save its plummeting story with the final showdown between Naruto and Sasuke, but the damage had already been done over the course of about 100 episodes. Critiquing the music and art would be meaningless - both were great, just like the previous installment in the series. When the show shined, when it had potential, the viewer could only hope for it to evolve into something generational. While it did in terms of the influence it had, it severely lacked that quality in its narrative. Impactful parts hit as hard as the bad parts disappointed. The sheer length of the show acted as its saviour; everything up until the war's downs (and there was a lot) was great. Naruto: Shippuden was definitely much better than its prequel, had everything going for it for the first 70% of the show, yet when it came to concluding the series, it did anything it could to just reach that point, even if it made no sense.",8,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_bbffb859d6,20,5039
"Again, I skipped the filler in this show. Say what you want about the rating and the payoffs and the pitfalls but let me tell you guys this show made me cry (you all know what specific character death I'm talking about here) laugh, rage and everything in-between. You come to care for character's you never thought you would more than you ever thought you would. You're invested in their lives and in the plot and despite all it's flaws I can't help but say the hate is not deserved. Shippuden is really great, even better than the original imo, and you can come to your own conclusion upon finishing it (believe me I have qualms myself) but please do give it a try.",9,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_d5d4966975,20,666
"Story: 9 I really love the story, and -spoiler- the storyline gets exponentially more complicated and I really like that. The mediocre 'me = best ninja and my friend ran away, I must get him back' changed to some masterminds with mindf*ck plans that actually make sense! If you're a kid, you won't get what happened after the first arc with Sai. Art: 1 It's not exactly the art, it's the animation. It's like they don't care if the animation is any good. They slagged off with the starting of shippuden and I really can't give a higher grade than an 1 Sound: 5 It had some great OP and ED's, especially bacchoi!! I really like most of the voices. Some of them are anoying, like sakura, but in general it's quite good. Character: 6 I dislike a lot of them. A lot of them are just annoying, like sakura, but there are some characters who are just epic wins! I would like to praise Itachi, Deidara, Jiraiya, Pain, Shikamaru, Hinata and Kiba. Enjoyment: 7 Despite the lack of good animation and annoying voices and characters, this anime has a lot of great jokes and some characters just make you laugh, no matter what.

I actually grew up with Naruto. I was around eight and use to wait for him to come on adult swim. Enough corny backstory let`s get into Naruto: Shippuuden. I really like this show. The fact that he was able to beat all odds when the world wanted to see him fail or to become mediocre its a good lesson for people of all ages. Not only that every episode had a lesson attached to it. OK Let`s get into the cons. Those D*MN filler episodes towards the end. I don`t know if he was trying to continue this anime like the infinite tsukuyomi or what. I understand the creators need to stretch out this legendary and famous anime but come on dude. Also the graphic animation of fights of the last few seasons of the anime were a bit ..odd? Like you couldnt see legs or their faces were contorted so weirdly lol. Maybe they were trying to stress the magnitude of power each character held? I don`t know but it was funny looking. The anime finished when both Naruto and I was seventeen and I was in SHAMBLES.

"Oh boy, this is going to be a long one. I put Naruto Shippuden on Hiatus way back when in 2012 or so, when I caught up to the manga. At that time, Bee was first being introduced as a new character. 8 or so years later, I finally, over the stretch of a month, finally finished the entire show. There will be some spoilers in this review. It's been like 7 years since this show has been released, so I highly doubt you haven't watched this show, or plan on doing so anytime soon. In all honesty, Naruto: Shippuuden can be said to contain many flaws, some including ridiculous plot armor, plot holes, and questionable character development. Let's go over them. When talking about the plot in Naruto, one also has to include characters. Characters become a major plot point in many of the most important arcs in Naruto, and so they have to be discussed side by side. And what else but starting with the Main Character himself, Uzumaki Naruto? Naruto can't be considered a terrible shounen main character, and he certainly fills the role quite well. The problem is that much of his character could have been developed in a much greater way than what actually ended up ensuing in his self reflecting and confrontational arcs. His beginning arcs were probably one of the best I've ever seen in a show: gradually transforming from a loner to an identity as a member of team seven. Iruka was the first person to acknowledge Naruto, and this gradual dynamic between Sasuke and Naruto begin to begin. Naruto is able to get acknowledgement and satisfaction from the bonds that he painstakingly forms, and Sasuke doesn't even want to form them in the first place, and thus begins the whole entire setup for their rivalry down the path. However, somewhere along the line, Naruto begins to stagnate as a character. He's extremely immature throughout the entire show, and despite this childish nature, still manages to mature in different ways. This is confusing to say the least. When it comes to his goals, which he eventually finds out with his interactions with Jiraiya and Pain, he's able to easily find his determination and objectives. which of course, can be summed up in: peace. Yet, at the same time, he's idealistic and lacks any sort of concrete plan that allows him to follow up on that objective, and this continues until the very end of the series, where he still has this immature idealistic world view. Neji's death might have been a wake up call for himself, and in some ways, it is. He realizes that in conflict, not everyone can be saved, yet he shouldn't wallow in that despairing emotion, but make sure that the ideals that the person died for wasn't for naught. Perhaps Itachi's talk about how not every burden can be shouldered on his own could also suffice as a rare form of maturing. However, this is where his maturation as a character seems to end, and these moments are few and far between, not to mention, extremely short. There are so many characters and story arcs that focus on Naruto persevering and reinforcing his determination for his goal, but there seems to an extreme lack in any sort of maturing or learning of how he's able to complete such a task. Instead of learning from his own mistakes, he instead gets convenient plot armor in the form of who knows what all scattered throughout the entire series, and this makes him bypass any sort of realization that his actions have consequences. Over and over again, you see Naruto charging into battle, determined to follow through his ideals, and stubborn enough to not ever budge. This is alright, but in the end, he gets beat up, but bailed out by whatever plot devices the author wants to throw at him. Maybe, if someone got extremely hurt, someone died for his mistakes, this would have been a key to his character development. Neji's death occurred in the rare moments that Naruto's actions were completely logical and were not made in a hot blooded attempt to stop the enemy. There is no arc where he undergoes the consequences of his actions, nor is there any arc that helps him understand the reality of his dream. What exactly is it that he can do to make hate disappear from the world? This self searching arc never began. I think it would have been immensely helpful to the depth of Naruto if there was just a single arc where he sees how conflict happens and faces the reality that there isn't just a single ""good"" side and ""bad"" side. Naruto obviously understands this theme very well, but it was always through the flashbacks of other people that he watches as a bystander, and never as a personal experience, and as a result, he never truly matures as a character as intended. The fourth ninja war could have been a great example of this happening, if not for the fact that that entire arc was pretty dumb. It clearly marks the shinobi world as ""the good guys"" and Madara and his gang, ""the bad guys."" Is it really a shinobi war if it's essentially Madara versus the entire world? It's ridiculous how such a great potential arc became a ""good"" vs ""bad"" guy arc. If there was a split in nations supporting and going against Madara, this could not only have been a great way to express how conflict isn't always black and white, but also great fights. Instead, we see lame fights between reanimated people, rather than real ones with real motivations. There is such a distinction that the author wants to make that ""these guys are bad and mind controlled by jutsu"" that it was hard to sit through. In fact, instead of having people side with Madara, in the end, everyone that used to support him goes against him, truly making it so that there is as little need for any distinction between good and bad at all. The entire war arc feels like a ""side character"" arc and doesn't feel like there was any sort of real engagement or conflict of interests in place, since again, everyone on the enemy side was mind controlled or copies of Zetsu. Sasuke, on the other hand, manages to be a much better character in this aspect. Broiled in revenge, he kills his older brother, only to find out the undertones and plots that are hidden in the village. He sets his eyes on the sole reason why Itachi had to kill his own clan: the clan itself. However hot blooded revenge is stopped short by meeting with his brother once again through edo tensei. This arc of revenge to redemption is a clear turning point in Sasuke's character, and is the reason why his goals go from a revenger to a desire to be a savior. This decision to become a savior was also only after he came face to face with the previous hokage, which again, further reinforce the fact that not everything is light and dark. He also cements his perfect idea of what it is to achieve his goal as a savior. What Naruto and Sasuke both have in common are their idealistic hot blooded pursuits in their goals, yet Sasuke manages to comprehend, through his self reflection, on how to achieve his goals, however silly they might have been. And despite the fact that there is such a focus on Naruto's character the entire series, there fails to be any sort of progression as a character in Naruto for the most part, only reinforcing his idealistic dreams, while Sasuke is able to become a more well rounded character with much less screen time and focus. In the end, Naruto's and Sasuke's goals are both idealisitc, but Sasuke matures more as a character, and even determines his next course of action without much difficulty, while Naruto is merely led along the plot of ""defeating the bad guys"" for essentially, the entire series. This does make Naruto progress as a character, but stops short of actually trying to make his abstract goals tangible through his own way of thinking. Plot armor is also a pretty big issue for Naruto, but it is such for all shounen series in general, but the more pressing issue is power progression. Naruto is considered to be a pretty untalented person, yet he still manages to become the strongest shinobi in the world. How did that happen? Power progression in Naruto Shippuuden is one of the most inconsistent things. People get crazy powers throughout the entire show, and not only is this method fast and instantaneous, it also happens so often. There are so many times in the show where a huge fight is tilting greatly in one side's favor, but due to a crazy powerup reversal, the other side has a great advantage. Both the ""good side"" and ""bad side"" do this constantly near the end of the arcs. Not only is this pretty stupid, it doesn't make a lot of sense plot wise. There were many times where some people were so overpowering the other side that the fight was declared over, yet somehow, they don't finish them off and allow them to power up. This power progression is also reserved for a select few, so essentially Sasuke and Naruto become the only relevant characters, power wise at the end of the story. This brings more consequences other than poor plot. It completely destroys and semblance of need for any side characters, and this is my biggest problem with the series. Naruto has one of the best cast of characters in the entire series. Lee, Tenten, Gaara, Neji, Guy, Iruka, Ino, etc etc. There are definitely quite a cast of arcs dedicated to a lot of side characters in Naruto, and it is one of the best points in Naruto. These characters have great personalities and contributed to the plot greatly, earlier in the story, yet fade to obscurity as the story goes on, and when Sasuke and Naruto become overpowering and leave everyone behind to the point where they don't become any sort of meaningful support. Arcs without Naruto in it tend to be pretty damn good. My favorite arc in Shippuuden was definitely Shikamaru and Asuma's arc. The fights were great, Shikamaru's development was great, and the enemy was interesting to watch. In the end, it goes to show that it was definitely possible for there to be a lot more potential arcs concerning the rest of the cast of characters, but it was never explored, but rather just wasted on Naruto. Fights were flashy for sure, but when the same message of ""wow you're just like me, I was lonely and sad too,"" and ""bad guys are bad, I want peace"" gets repeated over and over again, you wonder what could have happened if these characters got more love. Not only are characters shoved aside because power level wise, they were completely obsolete, but it also got rid of any sort of interesting fights involving ninjutsu. Shikamaru's arc, again, is an excellent example of this. His shadow binding jutsu was used in unique and different ways, and so were the enemy's jutsu as well. He couldn't afford to get injured because the enemy was able to reflect injuries right back at you. There was a lot of strategy and matchups that were used, but in later fights, this doesn't happen. It's just more like ""I'm going to bash you in with my OP power, you don't stand a chance,"" and for the most part, this is basically what happens. No unique techniques get introduced, no interesting strategies, but just straight up broken and OP powers get brute forced into defeating the enemy. Elemental weaknesses and strengths essentially don't get mentioned ever again at some point. It really sucks. Power creep in Naruto not only demolish characters, but it also got rid of the interesting ninjutsu's that people were employing in fights. This is most apparent in one single ability: Edo tensei. A completely busted and overpowered ability that has so much impact on the ninja war, yet apparently becomes super weak in the later arcs. What happened to invincibility? What happened to unlimited chakra? Edo tensei manages to become one the most busted jutsu's in the show, but becomes practically useless by the end of it, and it also highlights the lack of consistency. Edo tensei not only becomes obsolete because of power creep, but more importantly, it actually gets weaker for no reason at all. It goes from an invincible form that can't be stopped other than sealing. Regardless of element type, sage chakra, or OP abilities, they will regenerate. Regardless of how much chakra is used, they can regenerate. These features become disabled right after the ninja war arc, and it's never explained. What a bunch of bull. I talk about characters in Naruto as if there were no bad ones. Far from the truth. Sakura and Kuruma are the worst characters, by far, in the series. I always knew the meme about Sakura being useless was a thing, but I thought it was an exaggeration , if anything. It really wasn't. Sakura is a piece of emotional baggage that had literally no influence on the plot other than the fact that Naruto liked her. Liked. her. It was pretty clear that Naruto liked Sakura in the beginning of the series, but as time went on, Naruto accepted that Sakura didn't have the eyes for him, and Naruto even matures so great that he calls her out on his fake confession. This shows how much as a character Naruto grew in this department at the very least. If this were in the beginning, Naruto would have accepted it no doubt. Sakura, on the other hand, can't make up her mind. Time and time again, she can't make her own decisions, and it's clear that her only role in the series is to make us pissed at her. She can't make a decision on Sasuke. Or on killing Obito. or on her resolve to fight. She is such a static character, as she never truly progresses or matures throughout the entire series, and is babied the entire way by all the people around her, especially Naruto. She too, suffers from power creep immensely, and never manages to catch up to, even after her line of ""I've caught up to them, Tsunade"" quote. What a joke. She's unironically also a simp. Loves Sasuke from beginning to the end, despite Sasuke only berating her, trying to kill her, and not making a bond with her to the end. Even after all the crap Sasuke does to her, she is irrevocably in love with him. Holy. Crap. Naruto moves on with his love eventually, yet Sakura manages to never do such a thing. Without reason, no matter what Sasuke does, Sakura loves him anyway. She didn't do a single thing for Sasuke, in the end either. As Sasuke said, the only bond he had was with Naruto, not Sakura. Naruto was his only friend. Naruto is the one that Sasuke acknowledges, not Sakura. Overall, not an impactful character. She hogs a bunch of screentime only because she was on team seven in the past with Naruto and Sasuke. Kuruma's definitely a much better character than Sakura, but he's still a pretty bad one. He just randomly transitions from an amalgamation of evil to ""good guy"" within the span of a few minutes in a single episode. I think we all knew that Naruto was going to bond with Kuruma and that Kuruma was going to eventually befriend Naruto, but what a lame and anticlimatic bonding that was! Sure, there were many arcs regarding the evil nature and uncooperativeness of Kuruma, and the his tug of war with Naruto, but there really wasn't much of a bonding arc, and this was much needed. In the end, he gets defeated by Naruto, and acknowledges him as a result. You might be thinking that Sasuke's bonding with Naruto was essentially the same thing, but Sasuke wasn't actually ""defeated"" by Naruto physically, but philosophically. and this gets explained a lot more. Kuruma's arc felt like subdued=good guy. Not only was it short, it didn't make a lot of sense. That concludes the main points I wanted to share. There was a lot more to cover, but these were the major points that I wanted to cover. Side note: I had the benefit of being able to watch both the anime and read the manga long after the series had ended, and as a result, I was able to navigate any and all fillers by combining my reading through any chapters that were mixed/filler, and skipped all the episodes that were filler. As a result, I had the unadulterated canon viewing experience, and in my opinion, the best way to experience the show. I can't say I would have enjoyed the series as much if I didn't have this opportunity, and can't blame other people for disliking the show because they had to sit through all the filler content. But hear me out. I get it, the filler is bad, but unlike one piece's way of introducing filler, in Naruto, pacing is still alright. There's just filler in the form of entire filler arcs and flashbacks. This can easily be skipped. One piece's filler was ""unskippable."" The show was just at a constant snails pace, which led me to adopt only the manga as a result. Given I could skip the filler, I still rate the anime decently, comparable to the manga.",7,Recommended,"Jan 4, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_dc2fb1fed9,20,16577

"To be honest.... this show was actually great... in essence, it could have been one of the most amazing and adventurous shows imaginable, with kick ass fighting scenes and heart felt emotions that are honestly pretty relate able. With its large and expansive world, having its own history to it, it's hard to imagine such a show being fucked up!!!.... Oh wait... -.- Now being serious, Naruto could have honestly been one of the greatest shows imagine able. You have this fleshed out story following this one kid who was looked down upon his entire life, and you see him rise and up and fulfill his dream. What could be bad about that!? That already sounds awesome!! Then you add in some more kick ass characters like Kakashi and fighting scenes and an actual story and a goal and boom!! Sounds good right? R-right....? Now... here's where in my personal taste, this potentially amazing story and show, goes skyrocketing the opposite direction it had the potential to go for. There is, so much, SO, MUCH, POINTLESS, TALKING...... in this show you will catch yourself watching 40% of the last season despite it being the next season and when I say this I mean the FLASHBACKS HOLY SHIT. The fillers in this show are even immense, most of the talking in this show is also very pointless.... and what's worse? The action is crap!! And no, I don't mean the action itself is crap, honestly it was pretty enjoyable, that 1 minute of fighting you saw for every 45 minutes of talking, you get why I think it's crap now? Even IN the middle of some fights when all the action is building up and the drama and intensity is rising, SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE, has to SOMETHING, that involves that..... or wait, even better... a flashback.... This show honestly had so much potential, it has such a wide spread world that is honestly pretty unique and creative. It has a very fleshed out story, explaining things from the VERY beginning (you rarely if ever see shows doing this) and an amazing adventure following this one admirable kid grow up with great and fleshed out characters near him. The fighting itself is honestly not boring and some of the dialogue is honestly pretty interesting, and heartfelt. But what totally and completely ruins this show for me is the fillers, the constant nonsensical talking, and the CONSTANT FLASHBACKS I CANNOT STRESS THIS, We just got done watching Naruto when he was a kid (first season) and we're onto the second season and you think we need to REWATCH what we already WATCHED!? And that's not including the fillers that INVOLVE flashbacks that have NOTHING to do with the show. Literally the most pointless thing imaginable, imagine it, right now, and Naruto will make a fucking filler out of it somehow. Mind you most of this is the show version, I heard a lot of the fillers and pointless talking is taken out of the manga, but honestly I wish they did a better job with the anime.... the sounds in this show are honestly quite nice and do a good job of impacting the show and making the scenes they provide more vibrant..... With Narutos interesting and unique characters and setting, along with an admirable person following an ambitious dream leading us to various interesting and adventurous tales and awesome fight scenes, this show had so much potential..... I hope in the future they will do a rework on this could be great show.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 25, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_52d74d4894,20,3359
"This is so much better than Naruto guys. This is a whole other level than that and it deserves your time. Here's why: Story: 10 This show doesn't have an over arching goal like many anime do (Hunter x Hunter 2011 or One piece for example) but it just a story of a boy growing up and maturing into one of the finest shinobi and coming into contact with the problems of the world he lives in. He meets people and gets help and guidance along the way while becoming more and more reliable and powerful. It really is awesome. Art: 9 I love the art and the theme it gives the show is great. The only reason this isnt a 9 is it can get sloppy at times, especially during fights which really angers me at times but usually it is great. Sound: 9 Though sometimes is can be a bit cheesy I absolutely love the soundtrack of this show as well as the original Naruto soundtrack. Character:10 Some of the strongest parts of the show are seeing the connections Naruto creates with others and seeing his relationship build with the people closest to him. You really really feel his development as a leader, fighter, and thinker in this show and are cheering for him every step of the way. He isn't a spazzy annoying kid anymore and you really see that. Progression of characters is show as the theme of generations is really stressed and the youth inherit the world from the old and children become their parents etc. It is a fantastic theme. Enjoyment: 9 The fights in this show are awesome and the new powers and villains are some of the best parts of this show. My single character villain ever is in this show. Guess who it is I bet it won't be that hard haha. This show makes you run in circles going ""DAMNNNNN"" and also can make you tear up a bit and make sure no one sees. Overall:9 It isn't a masterpiece, but it is damn close and by no means a waste of time for anyone. Go watch this show. Especially if you have scene Naruto and think their world of jutsu is interesting then this will be a great use of your time. I watched it twice already and it was just as good the second time (skip the fillers though honestly).",9,Recommended,"Jul 10, 2013",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0044173170,20,2112
"Naruto Shippuden is 60% filler episodes and 40% story Story: This is your basic gotta get to the next power level to beat Cell kind of story. they do try to throw in some emotional stuff but it falls very flat and the ending ends just how you expect it. The story is so attached to the main group of side characters the only 3 out of over 20+ actually die. Art: Even though the anime ran from 07' to 17' the art style more or less stayed in the 07' era thus the later animation is average quality Sound: Many Many theme songs for some one or two might be decent enough. However the Main characters voice is like nails on a chalkboard. The same song is used repeatedly(for dramatic effect) in many of the episodes thus nullifying any impact it once had. Characters: The One place where this anime shines and the reason this anime has the most fanfics of any anime. Let me be clear, Naruto the main character has a terrible voice, is pretty annoying and has a extremely ridiculous obsession with Sasuke. I hate Naruto, but There are so many other decently fleshed out characters you will find a few that you may like and most of these character get an episode or two where they are the main focus. Enjoyment: The fact that every episode has a flashback of a previous episode or flash back of a flashback that we have already seen (which sometime take up more then half the episodes runtime) makes this anime extremely annoying to watch and has gained the nickname FlashBack Simulator. Then smack dab in the middle of a main story arc they put in filler arcs just to extend the series length and making so you have to burn through an arc that has nothing to do with the main story to get back to the main story. Even then some episode are nothing but slow talking with long pauses and by the time the episode ends not a lot has actually happened. Some fights are really really good while others they just stand there and talk a lot. Overall: If You have LOTS of spare time and liked the original series you may like this or you could skip to the last 10 or so episodes and be like ok this is them 2-6 years later the end.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 21, 2018",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_e233af45ca,20,2118
"Story: The story of Naruto Shippuden is about Naruto Uzumaki he is one of the 9 jinchuriki. Naruto came back to the Leaf Villiage and god knows where he was. And this continues with Naruto continuing going after Sasuke Uchiha, his best friend. It's a nice story to be honest. Art: The art in Naruto Shippuden is the same as the original just a bit upgraded. It's art is very good, compared to most anime I've seen. Sound: The sound is great it's the same as the original Naruto, so there's not that much to it. Character: The character in Naruto is good, it's just the development, it's so slow, and you hardly see any development after any battles. Only with Naruto, you hardly see any other characters develop. Enjoyment: I've enjoyed the series a lot, Naruto is one of my first animes I've ever watched it's a good anime, and it has a great story, very good art, and great sound. Overall: I rate Naruto Shippuden an 8/10. The sequel to this series great, the art and sound are great, same with the story. It's just the character that stops this anime from getting a 9/10. I wish we get to see other characters learn new jutsus, this series is very good overall. I recommend it to people getting into anime.",8,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_2422b56ea1,20,1209
Even though I marked some things as outstanding... I have to say that I think the writer and anime producers of this anime need to stop focusing so much on developing Sasuke. I'd like to see more of what Naruto can do then see Sasuke completely be the main focus when the anime and manga is called Naruto...I dislike it when writers focus more on one character instead of focusing on the whole reason they wrote the series called NARUTO.,10,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_0d0e159d29,20,437

"Before I begin, I notice this anime is one of those ""love or hate"" animes. There's some people who say it's the shettiest anime ever, and some who say that it's the best anime ever. The people who claim it's the best anime ever should watch some more anime and THEN re-rate, and the people who claim it's the shettiest anime ever... are just following the crowd because people like to bash on the popular anime. This anime is seriously NOT OVER-rated given how many people hate this anime, and it's also not UNDER-rated given how many people love this anime. Done with my rant xD Story - 7/10 It goes by arcs and the story isn't confusing (if you watched from the beginning) and several arcs are really sad and the plot was interesting to watch. However, I feel like it's dragging on and on, and the comedy scenes aren't as funny as the first Naruto. Another thing is the ""I will bring back Sasuke! Believe it!"" and ""He's a precious friend!"" is overused too much. Is Sasuke the only thing Naruto thinks about? (Then comes the SasuNaru fans, myself included) I don't get how a traitor who betrayed his friends and village due to jealousy and vengeance is still a friend, but if Naruto thinks that, then it's fine I guess. Art - 9/10 Clean and easy on the eye, nothing too special, but the art is pretty nice. Sound - 10/10 Character - 7/10 The characters each have their own personalities, and I don't see much Mary/Gary stus.... except for Naruto himself. Not only can he train faster than anyone else (like when getting the rasengan and sage mode), he can also persuade a godly powerful dude (Pein). Naruto, in the beginning was a knucklehead ninja that everyone hates, but toward the end, he became less of a knucklehead and people began to acknowledge him, which was good character developement. Something about the characters annoy me, and that is how SO MANY characters have a emo sob story behind them. Enjoyment - 9/10 I enjoyed it. Overall - 7/10 The ""motto"" is like ""If you work your butt off and have the will to do something, you will succeed"" which is obviously not true. I also dislike the fact how Naruto often touches his tummy and go like 'Oh the nine tailed fox is inside me"" It just looks wrong... and sounds wrong... I can imagine Naruto giving birth to the Nine tailed fox lol.... Another thing I'd like to say has nothing to do with the review, but if the whole village treated me like shot shet and a jealous friend betrayed me, I wouldn't just put up with it... I'd probably bomb dat stupid village and give the friend a serious beating...",7,Recommended,"Dec 2, 2012",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c5df82833a,20,2562
"Oh dear, where do I begin? Okay, the first few arcs weren't too bad. We have a few decent storyarcs with a few alright filler arcs in between, that don't actually seem like fillers. Well, they kinda do, but they have their own intriguing stories. In the Wikia, it now splits some of the arcs so those unfamiliar to the listing (e.g. 'Itachi Pursuit' once featured the hunt for Itachi as well as stories revolving around him and Jiraiya's battle) will be confused (like I was just now!). Even the back-story featuring Jiraiya, and the Kakashi Gaiden adaptation was amazing to watch. Like Part 1, Shippuden features updated art, but it is still ugly in areas (have you seen the background ninja - who drew them?). The sound is pretty much the only thing that's going for the anime at the moment. The emotional openings and endings are still something I'm interested in. I know this is entirely to do with Kishimoto, but at least give Ten Ten some non-filler character development! She's worse than Sakura! Ten Ten only has development in the filler. The worst thing about the anime is the fillers. Yes, I said it. The fillers since the War arcs have all flashed back from before the War, and currently do not serve a purpose within the anime. At the end of 2015, there are only eight canon episodes. Where one of the main conclusions of the manga feature, instead there is no end of fillers - and as far as we can tell, none in January either - I'm looking at animefillerlist.com at the moment. Do yourselves a favour and read the manga if you haven't. It's not much better, though. If Naruto had an entire reboot away from Studio Pierrot, the fillers should be rewritten and classified as 'canon', and then the fillers are in their original places (so that they follow along in chronological order as to not confuse fans and keep the dynamic of the War arcs going).",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 28, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1e03536daf,20,1864

And dont get me started on Naruto and Hinatas relationship shieeet how can he fall in love with her in one movie ONE. How was he blind the whole show but then she makes a scarf and then he can magicly see like..... MAKE IT MAKE SENCE.

"It's way too old....back when I was in school watching some random Anime, I was told by my friend that a new Anime named Naruto is going to start soon in CN. That's when everything was changed....!! I have seen the first episode, to me it was amazing. It captivated me completely. That Anime had made a great impact on my life. I've learned so many things from that Anime. High in morals, it changed my way of thinking. I'm here to write a review on Naruto Shippuden which is a part of Naruto's world. To all Naruto/Naruto Shippuden Haters who think that Naruto isn't the best anime.....I disagree with you...coz is not only the best it's greatest of all time. And one more thing, Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is not for immatures and those who run out of patience very quickly. I consider it as Masterpiece. I do hate fillers...but I like them as well because even fillers in Naruto/Naruto Shippuden has something to do with the morals and the way of living. We all know that story revolves around a knucklehead Ninja who wants everyone to acknowledge him. With help his friends he was able to finally achieve it. There are so many reasons why I like this Anime....they are: 1. Great Story(High in Morals) 2. Deep Characterization(every character in this Anime teaches some good to us, you will get attached to them) 3. Evolution(yes evolution in everything - in the story, in characters, in fights, in techniques), I like new things...! 4. Emotions, Relationships 5. Side Stories(yes side stories of other characters - they are really cool) 6. Memorable heroes and villains(yes though we have one main protagonist we have several side heroes and villains with their awesome stories) 7. Logic(logic in every Jutsu development, in every fight) I've seen Anime with higher ratings but no logic in their battles, training.(IDK why people like something which doesn't support logic) 8. Explanation - everything is explained in detail. 9. Life Lessons - yeah I have learned so many things from this Anime characters. Almost all characters are my favorite but the special ones are Itachi, Naruto, Nagato(Pain), Shisui, Orochimaru, Madara, All Hokages, I will never forget Akatsuki....they are amazing..!! My most favorite episode is a filler....yes it's a filler, a filler in which writer expressed his views about the real world, real people, what it is to create and what it is to destroy, what is life, what is love, what is power? what we can do with our life and how we can be helpful to others!! So many things were just taught just in a single episode. The name of that episode is Ninja Creed. There are so many things that I wanted to explain here but people will get bored of my review so I'm ending this here. Keep watching Naruto Shippuden coz anime is still going on and the rest of the episodes will amaze us just as the previous ones did.

"Ok First off I've been watching the Naruto series since {May 2016} at first i was not going to write a review, After reading some reviews i felt obligated to put my 2 cents.. This review will be very biased in, my opinion but i dont care. Story 7 ~ We have two main protagonist (Naruto & Sauske) That are seen through the entire series and we also can also add in saukura as well as the rest of the supporting characters that get little to no screen time. If you watch the anime fully and completely then you can follow suit with the story/ plot there are misinterpretations in the story plot altogether. It infuriates me and ill tell you why most of this anime is made up of fillers, not that i find fillers important but its more so a drag you have people that were dead showing up in flashbacks, the fillers are ok i can at least say that honestly they do develop and cover more so of the time when all the shonobi were young and other crucial points in the plot... I just hate when good parts for example naruto v. pain there was like a ton of fillers i was at the edge of my seat only to be disappointed. Art 5 ~ What happened!!!! the art is terrible why did they get lazy tho???... the art is very flat you have stiff characters i wasn't really paying attention but when i actually did they looked like sticks talking, they got the characters flying in the air???.. moving forward i can say that i do like some of the sunsets that were really pretty and seemed some what realistic and some fights that really looked good and was vibrant overall they could have did better they got lazy and thats just that. Sound 8 ~ Personally i love the sound some of the soundtracks like ""closer, diver, and yellow moon that i was able to find on itunes and now i listen to them daily... some of the music is ok but i still listen thoroughly (so i can grab food so i can watch the next episode) lol Character 6 ~ Ok in naruto shippuden theirs really nothing fun and giddy about it i must admit when i watched naruto i found it very annoying and extremely whinny but i continued watching it and it was very rewarding as i continued to go along with the story, naruto is not his same self there is really no humor in the series everyone is serious only sai giving us a laugh with his straight forward responses but there is little to know character development i just seen neji after 8-9 episodes like where are the characters that we all love and adore overall everyone grew up the same only thing i would say thats different is there attire. I wouldnt be surprised if urochimaru can back to life... moving on. Enjoyment 7.5 ~ 8 : ok i wouldnt say that naruto shippuden is trash i did enjoy the breath taking fight scense that had me rewinding every 5 seconds even the waste land of of fillers that seemed annyoing or even the determination that naruto has to save his friend.. they could have just took more time to strategically contrast the art the characters being stiff and character have slits as a mouth... ( naruto passing out after sauske attacked the sumit had me in tears) overall 8 ~ overall this is a good anime but i wouldn't recommend it if your constantly busy with work or school or etc. its very time consuming and if you dont have that much free time then this is not a good anime for you to try and be watching, you can watch a few episodes but the story plot takes so long to build everything started popping off at the chuin exams but dont expect for this show to have fight scenes every episodes overall if you have enough time to sit and watch this anime go for it.",8,Recommended,"Nov 29, 2016",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_af431dc346,20,3580
"Naruto as a series, is an incredibly complicated masterpiece. Assuming the person reading this has first finished the original Naruto series of our blond haired hero in his trademark Orange tracksuit, I will give a quick summary of some of the critiques I have of this series and what to look forward to in this next amazing sequel. First of all, the soundtrack remains iconic and amazing. The openings remain catchy and the soundtrack is both epic and marvelous. It tends to move away from the very fast-paced Japanese sounding instrumentals of the first series and enters into hymn and choir territory, especially with relevance to characters of God-like status relating to the plotline. Naruto shippuden is a very lore based series, and relates more towards philosophy and morality then the first series ever did. The battles are long, the speeches are longer. I assume Creator Kishimoto wanted his viewers to age up with the anime, beginning to question things they never did as a child. Therefore, expect the anime to become very complex and confusing at some points. Unfortunately, The loveable Konoha side characters that we independently learned and watched fight in the Chuunin exams and Sasuke retrieval Arc have a lesser role in the sequel. New characters and plot lines are introduced and many shinobis are cast to the side lines. The sequel is very much about focusing Sasuke and Naruto's bond and Naruto's own personal character development.. I would argue that the young shinobis still have much relevance, but less screen time in the main storyline as it progresses. The meme of 'NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARUTOOOOOOO' and 'SASUUUUUUUUUUKEH' is pretty much relevant to the series as Naruto fights further to bring Sasuke back to the village. ^_^ The new characters, especially the Akatsuki characters throughout the story, are super interesting and unique, so look out for them. They are all powerful individual shinobi with incredibly unique designs and jutsus. I found them to be the most enjoyable of the series and I hope the reader does too! Naruto Shippuden may not have the carefree, often comedic, nostalgic attitude of the first series main storyline, but it still provides a much enjoyable series and definitely a fantastic must see sequel to the first series to finally get a sense of closure. I have repeatedly stated the 'main storyline' through out this review, because if you thought the fillers of the first series was bad after the Sasuke retrieval arc...then I have news for you. There is a lot of filler. If you only care about the story and not the alternative universes or random plot lines, you may want to stick to the main story line and skip the filler episodes, however some of the fillers I'd suggest keeping a look out for - especially the alternative universe ones, as they give an interesting opposite perspective to the main canon universe. Just try not to get jealous if the alternative universe seems more...idealic then the real world, blood thirsty shinobi world..that was my trap of watching them! I wanted things to be different! ^_^'' I hope you enjoy Naruto as much as the rest of us do, and watch our snarky, smart-mouthed Kyuubi protagonist manifest and develop into an amazing, strong-willed character with all his comrades behind him as he fights for what he believes to be right and true.

"Story 8/10 - As many have already pointed out, the sheer amount of fillers and flashbacks, boy! They're unbearable. But thanks to fan-made Naruto Kai, pacing should no longer be an issue now. Still, can't afford tens of hours? Watch the entire show at 1.7x speed then! If you're a native Japanese speaker like me, you should have no problem keeping up. Some of the arcs like Pain's arc had a deep & profound philosophical theme and I loved it. Had it not for the pacing, I would've given 10/10, but alas. ________ Art 6/10 - I had to drop the show for 2 years because of the art-style. The change from Naruto to Naruto Shippuden certainly requires a bit of getting used to. Picking it back up after two years, everything looked so much better for some reason. But still, it's by no means perfect or even good. The animation on the other hand was outstanding, especially battle scenes. ________ Sound 10/10 - To be honest I didn't care about the OPs & EDs. But that's just because I'm not into Jpop (atm). They're by no means bad, though. The voice actings were superb. The casts were amazing. LOVED the background music! - 10/10 ________ Character 10/10 - Masashi Kishimoto is a genius at making characters loveable. Gotta love the easy to remember simple character names & their unique quirks. Most characters had a pure heart, and that's what drew me in. - 10/10 ________ Enjoyment 10/10 - As I said, watch the Kai version at 1.7x speed and you'll enjoy every minute of it! ________ Overall 10/10 - I always preferred One Piece over Naruto, I even fought my college friends over it, but after finishing the series today, well what can I say, I've finally experienced the change of heart.

"QUICK REVIEW, MINOR SPOILERS. so.. I finally watched Naruto, dubbed as one of the three great big shounen, and I have so many mixed feelings about it.. so let's start! Story 7/10: the story... was not one of its strongest points. It's good, but does it drag on unnecessarily with plot Twists that make no sense at times? 100%. A prime example of this is orochimaru switching sides randomly and with no real explanation other than 'the wind'. This is a character who's literally committed genocide. That said, I do think the mangaka does an insanely well done job with highlighting certain themes from beginning to end, such as perseverance and friendship. The repetitiveness of the constant love/hate between sasuke/naruto, the idea of the 3 in a team representing history & idea of hate and love itself throughout history is what truly brought forward emotions for myself and really carried the plot. That said, pain arc was a masterpiece, and all the other arcs in shippuden pale in comparison. Furthermore, it concluded the huge series really nicely with the wedding... makes me wonder if boruto was needed... Art 4/10: disgusting, and the reason is in this section im including the outright bad fillers and flashbacks. Okay some fillers mightve been good , but when you're in the middle of a war and suddenly have a filler of happy konohamaru..no, just no. People use the excuse of 'were binge watching it now but at the time fillers were good' - let me tell you, no they weren't. Why? Because one piece has less fillers than naruto, running since 1997+ and being double the length . There's other ways to go around lengthening/ delaying the show, and having 20 episode arc long fillers in the middle of scene is a no no. And the flashbacks... you get flashbacks from the episode before. I truly wonder how much better naruto would've been without the fillers and unnecessary flashbacks. Sound 9/10: beautiful, the themes that play during a certain group, truly resonates their character. Openings and endings were solid. No complaints at all. Character 10/10: This is what carried the show. This. When you talk to someone about naruto, they don't say I wanna be naruto, the say I wanna be madara, or itachi or daedara. The villains were so well designed and have so much personality it truly is what made naruto into a masterpiece in my opinion. Naruto didn't carry the show, the villains did. The character development was top notch, seeing narutos growth throughout the entire anime was really solid to watch as well, same with sasuke. Even sakura to a certain extent. Also special shootout to kakashi, easily one of the most liked characters in the entire show, tbh all the characters were above average with design. Then there's the most significant characters, naruto and sasuke. The love/hate between them is so beautiful and eloquent, that it draws out a multitude of emotions from the watcher, who's awaiting them to meet. I've never seen such love portrayed as the way naruto did for sasuke in any anime really. Enjoyment 8/10: Naruto is truly unique. It's an anime I can see why so many people admire it. But let's be honest here, if the villains weren't as cool as they are , I don't think it would've been a show to remember.",7,Recommended,"Oct 26, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_db1c8f4912,21,3242
"Okay this is going to be long so please bear with me. Prior to me many have written reviews on this so, you may not find many new points. So I will not write about separately about story, art etc instead I will try to provide my view objectively. Now coming to Naruto Shippuden, I believe it has received so much positivity majorly due to its nostalgia factor. It may not be as bad as I make it to be for some people but let me explain you in detail. First let us discuss the main protagonists of the show: The main problem I had with this is the main trio. We can simply state them in three words ie, dumb,dumber,dumbest. Yes, they are so dumb. Naruto, the protagonist of the series never ever grows up. He is same as he was in Naruto(prequel) except for a few changes. And the people who used to dislike him come to like him for his same dumb antics. Even the characters who had rarely interacted with him believe in him and give *If its Naruto then it can be possible* vibes. They are the same people who hated him before. The dumber part of the show goes to sakura. She is there to make us believe that she is equally strong and determined in the team #7. Her love(only if you can call it that) towards Sasuke is so unreasonable and forced. She is so clingy and is there just to make life of naruto difficult. She, like naruto never stops the ""sasuke sasuke"" thing which is annoying as hell. Kishimoto tries so hard to make us think she has become better. She has always been useless, only occasionally used to make us believe even she is strong. At other parts of the show ahe is just there to occupy space. Now comes the dumbest part of the show. Yes, you guessed it right. It is none other than Sasuke. He is one of the main characters of the show but is absent for nearly half of the show. He gets ready to follow some stranger for the sake of power and ends up abandoning his comrades. To speak it was due to his jealousy towards naruto that made him to become strong. His motives are so messed up and they fluctuate tad bit too much to sympathize for his losses. Even till the end he is as hopeless as a person can get. I am trying to not spoil much but his sense of thinking is so messed up in the later part of the series. This is not all, our main protagonist is so righteous that he goes on and on about friendship that he ends up putting all of his friends into risk in order to save one selfish, arrogant idiot. He gives so lengthy speeches to the antagonists that it makes me sick. He never stops ranting. He is just too loud and annoying for a protagonist. His attitude isn't any better as he does some pretty nonsensical shit during missions that would definitely make you question his maturity even after these many years. Yes, 2 years later, Naruto became 15 years old, and his personality is still the same. He is still unable to refrain from himself from doing something stupid that would fuck up his whole team. What irritates me are the techniques. For some reason, everything is an upgraded version of his previous techniques; Rasengan to Odama Rasengan to Rasenshuriken. 5 Clones to 100 Clones, then went to 1000 Clones. Flashbacks are normal in many animes. However, Naruto is an exemption. The flashback last so long and most of the scenes are being repeated. Flashbacks in Naruto do not bear much significance in the story and yet I do not see the reason in dragging the flashbacks. The fight scenes in this show are all talk and no battle. The fight scenes bores me to death. Fight scenes are very predictable. All characters spend most of their time just standing an telling lame stories rather than fighting. This is how the fights go- Naruto uses Kagebunshin. The enemy beats all of them, beats Naruto to pulp, then Naruto teaches the enemy about life and friendship and at last Naruto hits the enemy with a rasengan and the fight ends. The backstories every antagonist is almost the same. Almost all were good but a single situation fucked up their lives and they end up on the bad side. This is not to say that there are no good characters. They are there but they take the back seat in the show. It took Naruto heck lot of episodes to just get a single power up. There is nothing wrong with it but in the final few arcs he literally becomes god which makes all his hard work seem pointless. The final arcs: Ah! These are the worst part of the the show. It involves the great shinobi war which is dragged to death. It is very poorly written and the antagonist at the end of the show makes this show a joke. There is no build up for it. Yes it is the kaguya part. The war part almost makes naruto and his precious friend sasuke gods. They become gods to defeat gods and naruto is now even capable of healing. The final arcs make all the established rules and world building look stupid. Logic goes for a toss in most parts. The good parts like a few arcs and characters are highly overshadowed by the terrible pacing, whole lot of filler and dumb main trio. The pacing is so terrible that there are so many pauses and others efforts put in to drag the show which make me feel nothing even after a bunch of episodes, as they cover very little progression. Don't even get me started on fillers. They just dragged the anime to make some 700 episodes which is not very enjoyable. Finally there are good aspects which others mentioned so I chose not to as I feel they are so overshadowed by the fillers, pacing and the terrible main cast. I don't know how many people liked naruto but to me he seems too dumb and immature. So I mainly believe that this show rides on nostalgic factor. It has many notable inspirations taken from famous shonen series like HunterxHunter and Dragon Ball. In the end all I want to say that there are better shonen series like HunterxHunter and it is not worth the time you put into this series. Believe me when I say you won't miss a single part of story even if you watch it in 2x speed. By the way this is my first anime review. Anyway it doesn't really matter as I have rather made this review pretty late I guess. I beg your pardon for any grammatical mistakes. Thank you for your patience.

"Shippuuden (non filler) Story 9: pretty solid story I'd say but didn't get the end goal. Naruto did not become hakage(training to be one). Great story of friendships and working as a team. Growing together. Art 9: great art during fights, some of the animation is not the best in the background (character wise) never the least animation is great for it's time.

The entire show is very entertaining including alot of the fillers giving you alot of time to have a connection to alot of the main characters, the story has alot of depth with what happens and what each character goes through with actual development so It's not just Naruto who develops. The show also wraps up very nicely although being a show with so many episodes you'll never have the perfect ending which is what Boruto is for. If you still haven't watched Naruto and are just looking at reviews for if you want to watch it or not I'd say it's a great mainstream anime to watch even with how many episodes it has which can look daunting but with the story it gives you it's definitely worth it.",10,Recommended,"Jun 21, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_52854daae8,21,884
"One of the most popular animes of all time.. Writing seems to have gotten better than its original series. The episodes where they showcase the past were probably the best episodes in the whole series other than the fights. The story was good but had bad pacing at times especially during the fights, some flaws, and also the sub par stories of some of the episodes because almost half of them were fillers. Character development was good also. The characters were alright, there are very few that are likable or interesting. Some of the openings and endings of this anime are legendary and are definitely in the anime hall of fame. The music was amazing. Animation looked pretty good but quite inconsistent at times. It had a similar vibe to the previous series. Overall it was an enjoyable series, it was well rounded and the only thing that really sticked out was the lore and history of this fictional world. Memorable: No.. Rewatchable: Maybe..",7,Recommended,"Aug 16, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4172182ef7,21,949
"Naruto fans need to calm down. This show needs 80 episodes MAXIMUM. The long awaited ending was completely BAD. If you have time to watch this UNNECESSARY LONG SHOW, skip the fillers and most episodes and you will still feel bored a bit. Every 50-100 episodes you will feel some kind of excitement, and then, LOOK AT THAT, MORE FILLERS. I was completely hyped for this show, myself and from other people, and I expected so much from it, but it is a really poor and long show all in all. Tastes are different, but there is no need to waste time on such an anime (where most episodes aren't even connected to the manga itself).",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_16630bad88,21,625
"First off, I just need to put it out there; I have watched over 300+ plus animes and I can gladly hit my chest and boast about the fact that this masterpiece — Naruto/Naruto Shippuden is my favorite anime ever. It would forever hold a special place in my heart. I would be honest, you might be put off by the ridiculous amounts of fillers which are overwhelming sometimes, but believe me, these same fillers help lighten up the dark theme of the series itself. The fillers are by all means evitable. And while some see these fillers as obsolete, I see them as a funny sitcom which does crank me up. Plot wise/story, Naruto isn't perfect, nothing is perfect. It does have some major plot-holes that I believe can be easily overlooked. The story revolves around a young boy named Naruto, he grew up as an orphan, completely neglected by the village all because he has a demonic (Kurama) fox in him. This is the story of an orphan who by all means wanted to he acknowledged, an orphan who wanted to be loved. All Naruto wanted was a family. A family! All Naruto wanted was to be the hokage so as to protect the village and everyone he loved. Without any context to the filler episodes, Naruto as a whole is one of (if not) the best anime out there. It was a good pacing, very gripping plot, some of the best arcs (I found none of the arc boring; some of my favorites from Shippuden are the pain invasion arc, forth great ninja war arc, and the pursuit of itachi arc, just to mention a few.) fleshed out characters, one of the most iconic villains, interesting characters, probably the best fight scenes I've seen in anime, everything, just name it, Naruto has them all.

"NARUTO SHIPPUDEN is the real deal but it also has its negative points. For example: too many filler episodes(almost 50 percent of anime is made by filler and most of the filler episodes ain,t worth watching at all. Its just waste your life time.) The anime is about the ninja world but its just showing too much hand sighs and trainings and it lacks some great fight scenes. just like season one, there are too many filler characters with a nonesence backstory that really means nothing. It could have so many great fights in it but naruto,s goddamn Talk no jutsu killed the mood. So many great & important characters got killed by kishimoto,s hands just to make naruto & sasuke the only reason to watch the anime or read the manga. There are too many useless characters like Rock Lee,Sai or choji. naruto & sasuke are just two ordinary shinobies that could defeat the gods with the power of friendship(NAKAMA POWER) and its really meaningless. Defeating the immortal & highly trained Gods with only NAKAMA POWER? Give me a break. and also, the plot armor is much more than it should be on my opinion: READ THE MANGA Even the Ending ain,t gonna worth it(watch the anime & you,ll get what i mean) in fact, NARUTO is just the most overrated anime in shounen-jump series. Its the one & only ninja anime that you can get. That,s all.",7,Recommended,"Sep 30, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a98593aa7e,21,1329
"Naruto Shippuden is definitely one of those series where if you truly understand it, it becomes very memorable whereas if you don't then you see it as mediocre. in it's most basic form Naruto: Shippuden is a series where about a boy named Naruto who just wanted to fit in with people, become respected and acknowledged by everyone including his best friend and rival Uchiha Sasuke. Naruto just represents the unacknowledged youth of today who are ignored by society and left all alone in to rot away. now let's get down to my real review of Naruto: Shippuden Naruto's story is fairly decent enough it doesn't have the best writing of a Shonen anime but it's not bad either it's fairly good. many a times it's about how society can fck you up and make you purposeless that you start to hate society itself, but again this theme seems to be repetitive used amongst some of the major antagonists throughout the series, the plot seems fairly predictable but not as predictable as Mid Ball Z lol Shippuden also has some retcons which were never addressed by Masashi Kishimoto I won't point it out here cuz I don't wanna spoil anybody reading this review. but Naruto is definitely one of the best anime when it comes to plot-twists of the show but hpwever these twists can come off with 0 foreshadowing at all but that IMO does little to make the series look bad, Naruto has very deep real life philosophy and emphasis with characters like Itachi, Obito, Sasuke, Pain , Madara, Hashirama , Hagoromo and Naruto himself. these characters more or less have been through very tight circumstances and in each case they developed different ideologies which are very similar at the same time that they follow. these characters with do or die life situations seem to be well written, when it comes to side characters who aren't villains or anti-heroes or dudes who didnt die a long time ago Naruto does fall short for example the females Naruto seriously are some of the most laglustre in popular the only who ones who even contribute a little are Sakura, Tsunade and Konan, and even then Sakura and Konan mostly serve as supportive beta females to their male counterparts while there is also Kaguya Otsutsuki who seems interesting as a character but the way she gets introduced is very unappealing oh I almost forgot to mention that Naruto:Shippuden also has one of if not the worst written female character in anime Hinata Hyuga, a creep with no individuality who makes me sick just by appearing on screen like everytime she appears i feel like fast-forwarding. Naruto still has some good compelling side characters like Might Guy, Kakashi, Shikamaru, Choji and Sai. Naruto definitely has Immaculate art and fight scenes, Naruto's fight scenes are one of the best in anime and it's mostly thanks to chakra for being a incredible power system throughout the series even from the days of the OG Naruto, Naruto fights such as Naruto vs Pain, Kakashi vs Obito, Might Guy vs Madara will always be remembered by Anime fans for generations to come, Baruti had very good comedy too especially with the adult jokes sprinkled in between. when it comes to music Naruto: Shippuden has incredible masterpiece openings like Silhouette and Blue Bird and endings too, their music is so addicting that I think Naruto: Shippuden is the very reason why I stopped my habit of skipping the openings Overall Naruto is a series that I would recommend if you have the time to go through an anime with 100s of episodes",8,Recommended,"Sep 30, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3b41a4967d,21,3481
"This anime is objectively the worst creation a men had ever product. There is like 95% of fillers, and the 5% left is produce with speed x0.25 , with full fixed shot, it's SO BAD !! There is like 500 épisodes, and you can easily remake the entiere anime 99times better in like, what, 4,5 seasons ? There is no more story , 4 or 5 seasons, the entiere remainder is filler.

"This anime is incredible, one of the best ninja stories of the entire century. Something so motivating, inspiring and beautiful that is considered a classic in the world of animation. The music, visuals and characters connect with the entirety of the human soul. Yes there are flaws, yes there are filler and so on. However that does not truly determine how amazing this story is, the history, world building, storyline and the aesthetic in general is what makes it stand out. The story is set in this blend of Japanese feudalistic society mixed in with current technological innovations, the atmosphere is set in this brutal world of war and conquest. In which there is this constant tension of war between empire like nations, in this show we get the perspective of The Hidden Leaf (Konoha). A village superpower with a diverse range of clans with different abilities. In this society we meet our protagonist Naruto Uzumaki, a mischievous boy who lives as an orphan. Compared to the original show in Shippuden, you can see him grow as a teenager and see how he matures and understands the harsh realities of human nature and the world. Simple messages are portrayed in a complex fashion especially in the upcoming arcs, were villains are too allowed their perspective and how they came to be. At times as human beings there are plenty of life lessons and reminders that Naruto Shippuden excellently shows such as the importance of loved ones and friends, a basic concept that allows human beings to bring meaning and to flourish. Secondly the importance of hatred and how traumatic events can haunt one forever, as we see in Saskue Uchiha From the characters each one has a difficult past or reality that they must deal with forever. Discrimination towards Naruto for having the nine tails inside him and the Uchiha clan, PTSD from war and a loss of comrades, and so on. Real life aspects that are expressed onto this story. On a personal level, this show has brought much inspiration, strength and reconciliation that has truly changed my teenage years as a whole. Overall this show is recommended to everyone, especially for those who are into history, philosophy, literature, mythology , cool fights scenes or simply someone who yearns for the light in times of darkness. Thank you Kishimoto and all the animators who participated in this masterpiece of art.",10,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ac492d6ca5,21,2363
"I watched naruto shippuden when I was 13 years old, so while I remember a lot of it I don't really remember enough to write a detailed review. It was ok. I skipped all the filler btw. **SPOILERS AHEAD.** Not major ones, but spoilers nonetheless. Pain arc was definitely the highlight. Sakura was useless for nearly all 500 episodes. Itachi's story was really well written. The akatsuki were a well written group, and I really liked Madara. Not a fan of the Otsutsuki. A real asspull because the author couldn't figure out how Naruto and Sasuke could defeat Madara. So overall I'd say it's ok. If the filler was cut I'd say it's good.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 3, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_3daef37f5b,21,633
"I keep my reviews short, simple, and to the point for those of you who don’t want to read the rest of these essays. If you liked Naruto, you will like naruto shippuden, it is absolutely worth your time. Do not watch shippuden unless you have already seen the 2002 naruto. This is a continuation of naruto. The fights are hype, the new villains are awesome, and there’s a huge improvement in characters. The world is expanded on even further, the story picks up and is fast paced. The powers get even cooler. We are blessed with some awesome music/openings. It gets surprisingly emotional at times, which you would not expect of this show. There are some must see fight scenes with legendary animation and build up. It has a problem with too many repetitive flashbacks, but you can skip through them so it isn’t unbearable. It sets up nicely for Boruto, which is the next continuation, while leaving you with a satisfying and conclusive end even if you are never to watch boruto. There are filler episodes like in the 2002 naruto and as I said in that review you can skip them and not miss out on the story, however if you have the time I would still go ahead and check them out if you are a fan. You can also just go back and watch them after you finish the main show. They are enjoyable and I do not regret sitting through them. If you are still hungry for more naruto after you finish, check out the movies.",9,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c659ab37b2,21,1409
"""Naruto Shippuuden"" gets me nostalgic AF. It's the one anime that you can't stop thinking about for weeks after completion.The story and the plot is pretty awesome. Action scenes were also nice. Sometimes the animation sucked, but the story took care of it. For example, the pain arc .It has some plot holes, like deidora could use self explosion repeatedly in edo form. But the only thing that keeps me away from rating it a 10 is its ""FILLERS"". The first impression of 500 episodes scares the shit out of people .Still, overall it is a pretty decent one .I would highly recommend anyone who has patience and guts to watch it.

"Naruto Shippuden is a legendary anime. It is old and it it brings back memories from the childhood. From the beginning i want to say that i only put 9 on overall because the enjoyment pull down the grade (i did put 6 because of fillers. 41% of the anime is with fillers). [this review may contain spoilers!!!] 1. STORY: The story is amazing. It is about a ninja that want to become the best one and he also wants to become the hokage (LEADER) of the Hidden Leaf Village (Konoha). The story got many good things but the story is also sad sometimes (some character die). From the beginning of series Narut, the main character is looking for his friend that left the village and join the Orochimaru team (Orochimaru is a villain). The story is most based on finding Sasuke (his lost friend). So i thing in the end the story is ok. Beginning and the End are so good 2. ART: The art it's very good because the Naruto shippuden was started in 2007 and in comparison with other anime the art and graphics are cool. 3. SOUND: The sound is amazing. It is so different from the others. It brings me old memories. 4. Characters: The characters from this masterpiece are incredible. One of them i think are made in joke because are so useless in the anime but Naruto, Sasuke, Itachi, Obito, Kakashi, Madara, The 4th Hokake, etc. are so powerfull, good costumizated and got lot of good personality. 5. Enjoyment: The anime is very good but the fillers are so annoying because they are in the middle of a good fight or somthing light that. I am saying it again: there are 41% of the anime fillers..... -----Overall----- The anime is great but the fillers are annoying. So the anime is 9/10 but i will give 10/10 because it brings me good memories of chilhood.",9,Recommended,"Mar 25, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_947c77c506,21,1745
"Ok first I loved this show. Well it entertained me so much.it entairned me for 7years .It taught some best life leasson that you can't learn from school .Well the fillers are high but some of them are good and some of them are serious waste of time. Well when I started to watch it the land of mist arc was not that much good but after that the chunin exam were the greatest arc in the og we got to see lot abt characters like neji, lee, ino-shika-cho trio, hinata, shino kina etc after the gaara's introduction and legendary sannins were great. And in shippiden we have got more characters. Villians: I think u can get more great villians in naruto than most animes like first we got orochimaru then itachi kisame and the whole Akatsuki. The pain was a badass and his arc changed everything. But the real master of manipulation were tobi and madara. Madara was built different. Story writing: The story was good but at the war arc it was whole twisted and our beloved villian doesn't get a good ending bad story writing of the whole arc. Character: characters were good except girls like sakura, ino, ten ten. But the male characters were good written. Tips: Naruto is a God anime my tip is that you don't have watch all fillers because it is not connected to story. And some fillers at last of the series were important ( ie, hagoromo's past) beside this everything is good.

"A very reasonable title, cut with filler and flashbacks to the point of being barely watchable much of the time. When in doubt, jump to a flashback. If in doubt about a flashback, put a flashback in your flashback. Are we at the climax of the series? Better bump it up to 90% flashback content. Can't remember what's going on because of all the flashbacks? Better recap — with a flashback. The producers of the Naruto Shippuden anime milked what I assume was a pretty good manga for easily three to four times its value by turning exceptionally bad hack writers loose on the story between installments of the manga, and by... well, it's like that time... When in doubt, jump to a flashback. If in doubt about a flashback, put a flashback in your flashback. Are we at the climax of the series? Better bump it up to 90% flashback content.

"Oh, indeed it's the ever so popular Naruto Shippuden. Ready to waste mindless hours watching yet another dragged on Shounen Anime? I sure am! Story: It's Naruto! Of course the story is going to be pretty sappy looking. Ya'know with the Sasuke and bonds stuff. But the thing is it is executed well. So the anime in the nutshell is. Naruto has left Konoha for a period of 3 years with The Legendary Sennin Jiraiya. Within these 3 years he has been training for future endeavors. Aswell within these 3 years everyone seems to hit puberty and have a major growth spurt. The former chunnin ninja have become adept, some of which have become jounin. After Naruto's fated return. His team is reunited with the classic bell retrieval test. Sakura and Naruto work together to steal the bells. They both demonstrate magnificent skill. Resulting in the reconsaince of Team Kakashi. However Kakashi is always missing or injured so Team Kakashi is lacking as a team. A mysterious new ninja and a Anbu member join the team. This is when the ultimate goal of Team Kakashi uncovers. To retrieve Sasuke and destroy Akatsuki. Seems Legit 8/10. Art: The art has improved over the original resulting a much more enjoyable experience. However overuse of certain animations is a huge turn off. Seeing the same traveling animation is quite irritating. Character Models however are very well thought out and designed. 6/10 Sound: I'm a sucker for good OPs, and NS has a good amount. Specifically Sha La La. Aswell the voice actors did a magnificent job. They aged everyones voice quite well. This would be a perfect 10 if it did not lack in actual Sound Effects which would be reused to death. 8/10. Characters: 8/10. They were good. Not quite sure how to say how without spoilers but whatever. Enjoyment: It is so far a very exciting watch.

"I should mention that I binge-watched this show and skipped about 95% of the fillers. I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Naruto Shippuden takes place about 2.5 years after the events which transpired in the original Naruto series. Sasuke Uchiha deserted the Hidden Leaf Village and joined up with the sinister Orochimaru to gain more power in his quest to kill his brother and avenge his family. Naruto Uzumaki decided to train with Jiraiya in order to improve his skill so he could get Sasuke back to his side. Meanwhile the threat of the organization called Akatsuki drives ever closer, who are out to capture Naruto. The story is rarely the strong point of a shonen anime. It often comes down to a villain who is drunk on power and who wants to take control of the world. In that regard Naruto Shippuden is not that much different. At the start it’s simple, but effective. Without spoiling too much I found that the story did get a bit too convoluted at the end, but I imagine it can be difficult to try and wrap it all up. I will say however that almost each villain has his own unique reason for why they want to achieve world domination. In some cases, I found myself even sympathizing with the villains. The line between good and bad is blurry and often there are flashbacks which explain why a villain has had a change of heart and why he or she has those different ideologies. There are a lot of interesting and tragic themes such as pain, isolation and destiny. These different motivations bring more depth to the villains. This is why I found the characters to be the best part of the show. There is the typical shonen protagonist Naruto Uzumaki. He is a total goofball, yet very dependable at the same time. He works and trains the hardest and he has the ability to connect with other people. He’s a good main character and I found myself cheering for him throughout the whole show. Sasuke Uchiha at the other hand is the complete opposite of Naruto. He is “cool”, very talented, all the girls swoon over him, but he struggles with himself and mainly with his past. Even throughout the original Naruto show I found Sasuke to be a very polarizing character. At points I disliked him and at other points I sort of liked him. This trend continued for me in Naruto Shippuden. Then there are a lot of other characters, who all have their own powers and weaknesses. We of course have all the Hidden Leaf Ninjas. We get introduced to ninjas from other villages. Some characters from the past get more fleshed out. Finally, we have the villains. I already made mention of the them up above. Pain and Itachi are some of my favorite characters in any anime ever. So, all in all that leaves us with more than 50 important characters. All of them are unique and you’ll find yourself picking favorites for some of these characters. Some of them focus on long distance, while others are hand to hand combat specialists. If you watched the original Naruto you will know there is a big difference between a Shikamaru or a Rock Lee fight. The main problem with having so many characters however is that not every character gets developed or his/her time to shine. In the original Naruto show we saw minor characters having proper 1 on 1 fights during the Chunin Exams and during the Sasuke Recovery arcs. They got multiple episodes and often you saw flashbacks of their pasts. This way you got interested in some of those characters and you had your favorites. Because so many new characters get introduced during Shippuden – and since we do not have THAT many villains – some of these ninjas do not get any fights during the whole of Shippuden. This is a shame since I was invested in some of them and subsequently didn’t get to see if they learned new techniques or improved. Their characters in effect didn’t develop much / at all. In addition, there is also a bit too much powering up going on to my liking. The fighting, the techniques and the damage inflicted all get turned up a few scales. Some characters even get buffed/evolve multiple times during one fight, which makes them literally (demi) gods. Other characters meanwhile stay behind. I believe this is called power creep? Another strong point of this show is the setting, the world of Naruto. How someone can come up with ideas and concepts like ninja villages, ninjutsu, genjutsu, kages, tailed beasts and how all that stuff is connected, is beyond me. It’s genius and it’s all carefully laid out and explained in this show. Just like in the original Naruto show, the soundtrack is amazing. There are some tracks which will pump you up for another great fight, and there are tracks which will hit you right in the feels. There are 20 different openings and 40 different endings. I’m sure you will find something you like and dislike. Personally, I liked the opening track called Silhouette by KANA-BOON the most. The animation is good. It can be a bit inconsistent and there is an obvious change of pace when high action episodes occur. I like the style of animation which gets used during those high actions episodes. It is more fluid, but I could understand if people didn’t like it. The fights and more specifically the hand to hand combat scenes are often amazing; even mesmerizing. I don’t like it though when the animation in openings already spoil upcoming events or matchups. This happened a couple of times. I feel like I also should mention something about the fillers. I binge-watched Naruto Shippuden and I skipped 95% of the fillers. I recommend you to do the same. I watched about 80 fillers of the original Naruto and they were mostly dreadful. 40% of the episodes are fillers so look on some website or in the forums here to find out which episodes are skippable. I recommend watching the Kakashi and Itachi focused fillers. They were enjoyable. The downside of binge-watching is that some of the repeated flashbacks are skippable as well. There are so many flashbacks in Naruto. It’s insane how often they for example showed Sasuke’s past with Itachi. I get that it’s really important, but they’ll show you the exact same scene about 5 times. If you watch 1 episode per week these flashbacks might be welcome (although I can imagine these kinds of viewers would rather want new and original content), but if you watch all the episodes in rapid succession then I’d say the repeated flashbacks are filler-esque too, unless you have a terrible memory. Overall, I would say that I really enjoyed this anime. I binge-watched this at a high pace during a somewhat difficult time in my life. I was always curious to find out what was going to happen next. At some point I was thinking about giving this a 10/10, but I decided with a 9.5/10 because of some nitpicking during the final arc. A day after I watched the final episode I just had a bit of an empty feeling as a huge, fun part of my evening and night disappeared. I am sad it ended, but I really enjoyed the ride. Let’s hope Boruto will prove to be a worthy sequel.",9,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2017",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_ae75dc99a1,22,7006
"Naruto Shippuden is a masterful continuation of Naruto's story, and as a series it even manages to improve upon its' predecessor - an anime which already needed little improving, in my opinion. Still, it has its' own drawbacks which will be off putting for some viewers, which I'll go over. The story provides more of the action adventure found in Naruto, while the plot really matures appropriate to the characters' ageing up. The mysterious Akatsuki organisation establish a threat right from the start, while maintaining suspense through many episodes as each character is revealed slowly, one at a time. These villains provide situations that feel truly perilous for our heroes, and the show packs in a solid handful of emotional gut-punches throughout. The arcs are varied enough to hold the viewer's interest across a long series, and bring focus to characters other than Naruto; as well as battling Akatsuki members, there are arcs focused on Naruto's training, on Sasuke's activities, or on revealing important mysteries and backstories. Now, there are still weak points to the story. There are some overpowered techniques conveniently used, such as Izanagi, Rinne Rebirth, or the 100 Healings. Several times characters are saved from certain death by such powers. While this might be an annoyance for viewers at times, ultimately I think Naruto has enough tragedy in its premise and across Shippuden's story, without becoming bleak by piling up too many corpses of beloved characters. Towards the end the story does teeter on the edge of the trap of 'too many villain reveals': ""I'm the villain- no I'M the real villain- no, fools, it was me all along!"". This isn't Shippuden's strongest hour, but it does serve to add a cool sense of destiny and fated conflict for our heroes, so if you enjoy that kind of element in stories, you won't be displeased. And - ultimately - the real final conflict is the one you knew was coming since the very beginning of Naruto, and when it comes at long last, it won't disappoint. To me, it delivers an emotionally charged and satisfying payoff to a series which I have followed for many years, and it's an arc I am happy to rewatch regularly. Overall, there are no unanswered questions left at the end, no frustrating ambiguity, and I think it is well worth spending 500 episodes to reach such a satisfying conclusion. The characters have always been Naruto's strongest asset, and that's no different in Shippuden. Our protagonists have spent time becoming stronger, they're more emotionally mature and (sometimes) wiser. My favourite example of this development across the time skip is Sakura, who really comes into her own in Shippuden. There is still plenty of room for growth for them across the series, and we get to see many of the large cast shine on their own. The histories of some fan favourite characters are slowly revealed, to great effect, any many new characters are added to the cast. By far and away the greatest of these new additions is that most beloved villain organisation in anime: the Akatsuki! And they're beloved for good reason. They are equal parts intimidating and badass; at times even goofy. They range from sympathetic anti-heroes, to assholes who are having so much fun being assholes that you can't help but love them a little bit. Each member is given adequate screen time to showcase their unique abilities and personalities, but even so, they're so enjoyable to spend time with that it's almost bittersweet to see them defeated; I just can't get enough of watching them. Of course, within any show, not every character can be perfect, and for me in Shippuden, Karin really takes the crown as the worst character in the entire Naruto-verse. Constantly annoying and adds nothing to the plot. Fortunately she is only a minor character, so we're not overrun with screen time for her. Conversely, the character of Killer B, who I admit I find tiresome at times in the manga, I actually find less annoying and more tolerable in the anime. The last thing I'll mention in terms of character is the slight pitfall which I think Shippuden falls into during it's latter half; that is a still expanding cast of less important characters. While they retain unique and memorable character design, the addition of a new set of characters from the nations neighbouring the Land of Fire ultimately doesn't add all that much to the story. I think this is because there isn't enough time to develop them much at the late stage of the anime, and they end up relying largely on gimmicks rather than fleshed out personalities (examples are the Fifth Mizukage and Omoi). This just means that if these characters are in peril, it's hard to care too much about it. The music in this series is absolutely outstanding. There is a new composer, Yasuhara Takanashi, who continues many elements and themes as to feel like a seamless transition between series, while introducing many beautiful pieces of his own, and appropriately badass character themes for many new villains. Some of the most standout tracks of the OST are Senya (or Many Nights), Girei, and Hyouhaku (or Wandering). It's an OST that I have continued to listen to frequently for more than 10 years. Of the many opening songs, a couple are average; the rest range from good to brilliant. The best ones do their job of pumping you up for the action, and provide an emotional kick for viewers invested in the characters. The best examples of this are Blue Bird, Sign, Diver, and Silhouette. Special mention also goes to Hero's Come Back!!, which was perfectly chosen as the first opening of Shippuden. It you come to this anime after Naruto and aren't pumped already, then this opening does that job for you - the song coupled with animation that includes a really badass shot of the mysterious Akatsuki organisation is enough to get anyone excited. To note; I watch the English dub, and I enjoy it immensely. I have still watched plenty of episodes in Japanese, as for most of the time I watched it the English dubbed episodes were a little behind the Japanese release; I don't think there's any notable shift in tone or quality between the two, so whichever one you prefer I think will be equally enjoyable. A notable mention goes to Vic Mignogna and Michael Yurchack who both voice versions of a character who is introduced later in the series, and stood out to me as unique and memorable voices for an important character. There's little to say about the art other than: it's just good. It's pleasant to look at, and the fight scenes are visually exciting. The lines look cleaner than it's predecessor. The palette retains a lot of it's vibrancy, though it becomes desaturated through certain arcs appropriate to the tone of the story, as our heroes face more serious threats and losses. The main drawback of Shippuden is much the same as Naruto's: an excessive amount of filler. And unlike it's predecessor the filler arcs are interspersed throughout the main story, so if you are intent on avoiding them, it takes a little more effort to do so (i.e. looking up filler lists online). However, I would say that some of the filler is quite enjoyable; the different tailed-beast arcs, Kakashi's Anbu arc, and Itachi's Shinden arc spring to mind. Also, a lot of the filler in later episodes tries to delve into some of the supporting characters, rather than being just meaningless monster-of-the-week fodder. Additionally, some later filler arcs are actually based on light novels that accompany the manga, rather than being anime-only. Ultimately, I think the filler isn't as big an issue for new viewers as it was for fans watching along as episodes were released (it could certainly make you impatient when waiting for the story to advance, back in the day); but any new viewer can use their discretion to decide whether to watch or skip ahead. Overall, Naruto and Shippuden have retained their position as my favourite anime of all time since I first started watching, more than a decade ago. I love being immersed in the world and I find the central themes and conflicts to be heartening, and emotionally satisfying. There are several arcs that I enjoy rewatching regularly on their own, and at any given point I'm itching to rewatch the whole series again, filler and all. For fans of Naruto I think it's highly worth seeing how the story develops and concludes in Shippuden. For viewers who are reluctant to watch Naruto (maybe it seems a little young) and want to jump in at Shippuden, I think it's possible. The backstories of the characters are revisited enough that it's probably not too hard to understand or follow, though I do think you'd be missing out on some critical character bonding from the first part.",10,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2020",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_fa6f19d32b,22,8740
"Original Naruto is probably my most beloved anime of all time. I would always go back and watch any arc and still find something that makes me watch 20-30 more episodes without feeling bored. Music is fantastic, animation is very good for the time being and plot for is very complex and yet simple to understand. I wish i could say same thing about Shippuuden. First 3-4 arcs kept the same pace and value to plot as original story. As i personally find Gaara arc not as great as later one i still can see meaning to be there. It introduced whole new enemy for protagonists and served as jump for series to more mature climate which i was hoping to stay until the end. Orochimaru/Sasuke and Shikamaru arcs only proved that this direction was right and gave us fantastic and memorable moments. I was invested in every single character introduced to the series up till this point in the series and waited for new episode to come out with excitement and hype. Until of course infamous Pain arc that started with big impact and ended with probably most awful and mediocre way that became the solution for every single problem in the anime. That is of course Naruto being the messiah that turns every enemy into his friend and make everything meaningless that happens in the past. Akatsuki mystery and threat built for almost half of the Shippuuden was just scrapped and every following arc became predictable despite having lot of turning points and amazing fights. The War had some great fights and showcases of characters but who cared at this point, because it was so stretched and had probably most fillers in history of anime ever. And of course we had 3 switches of main antagonist in like 2 years without ending a single battle. It became unwatchable and even animation started to look awful somewhere on the road. As much as i love Naruto franchise overall, i honestly can't give Shippuuden any score higher than 5. It showed potential at the beginning but it was butchered in the end. I find that just sad and i wish that show had more great storytelling and animation.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 3, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c11f66c49e,22,2073
"Naruto shippuden had great promise but was ultimately let down, let me explain. Lets start with what Naruto shippuden does well. Its characters: A diverse and interesting set of characters and while there is a lot it feels like the majority of them get enough screen time and backstory to justify them being there. The world: Naruto shippudens world is truly something to behold, Just the fact that its a world full of ninjas with different clans is cool enough but its a lot more than just that, As the show grows so does the world and we the viewer slowly starts to grasp just how intricate and mysterious it can be. Fights: While there are good and bad fights in every shounen for such a long show Naruto does have a consistent amount of good ones, Like other shounens such as Bleach these fights are gripping due to the fact that each ninja and ninja clan have a diverse set of tools and jutsus (techniques/ability's) giving us something new and fresh pretty much every fight. Moving on to what the show does ok at best. Animation: Super inconsistent. One episode can look great because they wanted to put a bit more budget into it and then the episode after can look nothing like the last, This can be demoralising and disappointing for a viewer who is expecting consistent animation. The show can look great but only if they want it to which most of the time is not the case as they want to save money. Sound (OP's/ED's): The openings and ending at the start of the show are a wonder to listen to they really put you in the right mood to enjoy the show no complaints here except for the fact that the openings gradually get a tiny bit worse throughout but that is bound to happen. The problem lies in the sound/music that happens during the episode itself not at the end or start. The music to me is too slow and sombre for what the anime is centered around which is ninjas and keep in mind these are not the type of ninjas who meditate they are the ones who throw goddamn meteors out of the sky (get what i am saying). I am not saying its bad its just ok, average if you will. Now lets get on to the bad: The story: The story of Naruto shippuden as a whole is fine in fact i would consider it good as it keeps the viewer watching by slowly revealing more about the world and whats really going on under the surface but its just not enough to save it from the curse that is fillers. 42% of Naruto shippuden is filler , Yes you heard me correct, No i am not memeing 42 goddamn percent , mother of god. Before you go crazy hear me out, While a large portion of Naruto shippuden is filler its not necessarily bad filler and to be honest i think some of the filler is needed as there are so many characters that get their backstory from said fillers, but even with that being said it is just way way too much and unfortunately because of this filler another problem rises from the ground like a weed. With loads of fillers comes pacing issues and these aren't some minor pacing issues because while a lot of fillers are obviously going to be slow paced the fillers actually make the pacing of the non filler episodes suffer aswell, also if you choose to skip fillers you will miss out on a lot of character development and backstory as that is the general use of them in the show, its a lose lose situation. I could rant about this for days but lets leave it there for now. Now that i have mentioned the good, the ok and the ugly lets move on to. Overall thoughts: Naruto shippuden is your classic shounen and because of this it suffers from the classic shounen problems those being terrible pacing and horrendous amounts of filler episodes which hold back what could have been an incredible show thanks to the awesome characters and world, Leaving the show only average towards the end. If you don't mind slow pacing and a huge amount of filler and give the show a fair shot you may find yourself entranced by Naruto shippuden's character and world building.",7,Recommended,"Feb 5, 2019",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_480a946127,22,3961
"this show was average at best, half the show was filler and the other half was just meh for the most part. i felt that my enjoyment for the show peaked at the pain arc, but then after that it was just me finishing the show because i was already halfway through and i figured i might as well finish the show. 500 episodes of a meh anime, i no watch again :) but in all seriousness i did enjoy a fair bit of the show, mainly the first half and remember that this is just my opinion so if you liked it, that just means you found something good in this show that i did not and i hope you did cause otherwise thats 500 episodes down the drain",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 28, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_eac7e9b6d3,22,637
"This review is for all of the Naruto series. ""a 7/10 show with 12/10 moments."" This quote, along with the addition of some 10/10 characters, sums up my experience with the Naruto series pretty well. I am in no way saying that Naruto Shippuuden along with it's prequel are flawless pieces of media, in fact far from it, but I cannot ignore the lasting impact this show managed to place on me. I believe it's important to take this show for what it is rather than allow ourselves to be blinded by nostalgia, so to quickly bring up some of the problems within the series I'll start with the frankly terrible writing of majority of the female characters. It is no secret that the girls in this show have some downright pitiful writing compared to the male ones, and there really isn't any way to excuse that. Throughout the majority of the show the girl characters seem to be used as plot devices to help forward the development of the primarily male cast, and seeing as Naruto is a battle shounen, this unfortunately comes as little surprise to me. Aside from this obvious fault, the other main problem that I'm sure everyone has heard much about is the sheer amount of filler. It is an undeniable fact that if your show is 700+ episodes long with over 40% of those being filler, there's a problem. This being said however, I understand why this was done, and don't see a problem if you choose to skip the filler episodes as Naruto is already a long series as is. Personally however, as long as I like the characters, I can find enjoyment in some filler arcs, that is if they are not shoved in the middle of an important story arc. There are other flaws such as the poor writing of the over 200 episode long war arc and the lack luster finale of this serious commitment of a show, but setting aside the bad lets touch on what makes this series so good. My love for the Naruto series stems from the pure attachment you get to it's characters, I mean how can you not after spending 720 episodes watching them grow and achieve their goals, as well as suffer from loss and hardships. It may sound cheesy, but after basically growing up with these characters for years of my childhood, they hold a special place in my heart, and therefore the impact of character death or growth hits that much harder. Something I really commend the Naruto series for is the writing of the ""villains."" They have you questioning what is truly good and evil, with most all the villains having a clear and sometimes rather convincing motive for why they do what they do, which is something I don't see too often in shows. Often times in media villains are just chocked up to the baseless cliche of ""taking over the world"" or just being downright comically evil, but I don't see that happening in Naruto. It is really hard to hate most of this shows antagonists, as you find yourself questioning whether these ""bad guys"" are really all that bad. In a classic battle of ideologies mixed with some beautifully choreographed fight scenes, the clash between the expansive cast of equally lovable characters is something you can't look away from. Aside from the villains, the rivalry explored between our main characters, Naruto and Sasuke, is what I believe to be one of the most enthralling dynamics in all of shounen. Watching the unbroken dance of emotions surrounding these two as they combat each other in passionate battles of skill and wit, as well as the internal mental conflict that they each face, is one of the most emotionally investing stories that I've had the joy of experiencing. Between the constant battle of love and hatred they feel for one another and the shattered bonds they share with their own home and family, the war going on within these two boys' minds and hearts is sincerely something to behold. It truly is a wonderful journey of growth and acceptance that while full of pain and heartbreak along the way, ultimately reaches a a conclusion that is wholeheartedly worth it. I find myself going back to watch the finale of their concluding fight more than I'd like to admit, but it's just that good. This iconic duo is one that is sure to be remembered for years to come. TLDR; Naruto has the power to make you fall head over heels for it's characters and world, you'll find yourself laughing and crying along side them, and before you know it the once daunting series may start to not feel as long. By the end I was yearning for more, wishing to see my favorite shinobi go on more adventures together, strengthening their bonds, experiencing joys and sorrows, and most of all continuing to make the Naruto series what it is; an experience worth remembering. I can safely say that while Naruto has undoubtedly gone down in history as one of the most iconic anime series out there, the lessons and emotions that came along with it will be forever etched in our hearts as well.",8,Recommended,"Jan 19, 2021",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_f9e646e783,22,4873
"So, I loved Naruto Part 1, and then I watched Shippuden, really excited for more Naruto, especially after everyone hyped it up for me. What I got is one of the most boring, mediocre anime I've ever seen. At least in the shonen genre. Let's begin with the story. STORY: After the amazing arcs in part 1, I was ready for some more amazing writing. Well, the first arc in Shippuden bored me out of my mind. I literally dropped the series for a few months just because I couldn't watch it. The second arc, Tenchi Bridge was a little bit more enjoyable, but we basically got a Kakashi and Sasuke rip off, taking the worst elements of both of the characters and creating two horrible new useless characters! The third arc was ok, it felt kind of dragged on in the 3rd act but it was good overall. The 4th arc brought Shippuden back the the writing of part 1, and oh my god it was amazing. There was tons of emotion, rich character development, and amazing fights and moments, just like part 1. I didn't like the ending to the arc, but it was mediocre at worst. The 4th arc was amazing over all. The 5th arc kind of felt dragged out, and it had poor character writing with Sasuke, Naruto and Sakura that I'll get into soon. It was really just set up for the 6th arc. The 6th arc was a giant arc, that had some amazing moments that I still love, great fights, and a amazing villain, probably one of my favorite villains of all time, but even then felt dragged out, boring and had HORRIBLE character writing. And don't get me started to the ending of Shippuden. It made me hate the show for giving me one of the worst endings ever, after I had spent over 500 episodes watching it. And there was a hell of a lot of filler, which I got fed up with and just pulled out a filler list and skipped all of the filler. Over all, the story was bad at some parts, ok at some parts, and AMAZING at other parts. It did have a ton of potential. 7/10. ART: The visuals sucked ass. I hated the art so much that it gave me eye cancer. Of course, when the show wanted to, it looked amazing. A few moments that I don't wanna spoil come to mind. Compared to part 1's bright visuals, its shit when they make it too bland and dark. Overall, 6/10. SOUND: Compared to the happy and amazing music of part 1, shippudens's music(apart from the op's and ed's) was horrible. I srsly hated this music. Its just a bunch of violins just screeching. Overall: 3/10. CHARACTER: Some characters get development, but most get pushed to the side. Shikamaru gets a ton of development. but Kiba gets none. Its just shit character writing. Sasuke has some of the worst development in anime, like this guy goes from wanting to kill his bro, to wanting to do some crazy crap that I think made no sense. Sakura had development at the start of Shippuden, but then goes back to being a Sasuke simp pretty soon. Naruto also becomes a complete Sasuke simp, always chasing after him and wanting him to come back. Sasuke literally told him a billion times to just stay away from him and stop being annoying. But Naruto just can't do that, huh? Kakashi barely gets development other than us learning his back story. And don't get me started on talk no jutsu. Remember when Naruto convinced Zabuza to be a good guy at the very end? Yeah now he does that with almost every villain in the story. It sucks. But I won't lie, some characters do get character development. So overall its a 6/10. ENJOYMENT: Even though there was numerous problems, I actually had a fun time watching Shippuden. I did get really bored in the first arc, and during the war. But in the other arcs had fun. It was an enjoyable ride, but I couldn't enjoy it as much as part 1 because of how shit everything else was. Overall: 7/10. OVERALL: I thought it was decent. So a 4/10. I will still recommend it if u watched part 1 of naruto and loved it a hell of a lot. But don't except the same amazing writing, character, and all the other stuff. It doesn't help that Chakra just gets way too OP by the end of the show and it just becomes DBZ. But overall if u are gonna watch it, skip the filler, and anything u think is unecesary.

"Naruto is an amazing anime that everyone should enjoy. The story is just amazing, they have such a great focus on all the character, you will definitely like every character, and not only the main people. Also they use the ""set up pull off"" technic very well, there are a lot of surprises along the way aswell whitch will definitely take you off guard. I have been emotianally toutched many times in this anime, which was not something that I thought i would be when I first started watching it. The music is simply amazing, both the intro and outro songs, but also the random songs that gets played. It is absolutely amazing and really helps the atmosphere. As far as i know, this is one of the best anime that is out there and it is definitely worth watching If I should point out some of the bad things (which there are) then it has to be that there are so many episodes that it is starting to look like it will never end. Also there are so many fillers in there, and it can get kind of enoying at times.

"I have to say, I dropped Naruto for a while and was ready to throw in the towel on the series. Then Shippuuden came along. The first few episodes in this series show growth in Naruto, something I waited desperately for, but he actually partially regresses as time moves on. Also, there was nothing really interesting happening around him. In fact, the two most interesting story arcs in Shippuuden were all about other characters. And what happens to Naruto while we're given an in-depth character development of a character that we've never seen before, that's not important to the overall plot and that we know will be defeated? Naruto jumps on logs. He jumps on logs chasing a guy whose power is to create clay birds. That's several episodes where all Naruto does is jump on logs, in a circle, trying to catch this clay guy. Yeah... All in all, Naruto Shippuuden is much like Naruto. It has some great moments, but it's just not worth looking through all the crap between them. Shippuuden seems to have fewer filler episodes and more filler content and bad writing. It's not the worst anime series out there, but to me it's just a big waste of time.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 16, 2015",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_a04b9ad502,22,1152

I feel conflicted, I want to love Naruto but the amount of trash that I have to endure.. Is it worth it? I haven't really been to active in the anime community. Probably cause I don't enjoy that much anime anymore. I pick apart anime too much. I should just watch it for fun and not look deep into its construction... WRONG! Story: 5 Generic shounen. I mean this started as ninja and ended with omnipotent super powers. I remember someone talking about how it used to be kunai's and shurikens being thrown but now its nuclear explosion level blasts everywhere. I remember when ""ninja"" was a term but this is not ninjas anymore this is some DBZ stuff. Another problem is the ending so ""SPOLIERS"" I guess...... Lets think about children how are they all the same age? Why are the combinations so random? I know Japan has some freaky sexual rituals but I mean how do explain this stuff ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) FILLERS OMG. I was able to endure the 5 episodes but those 5 episodes turned into 30. I dropped the anime at episode 375. Glad I did cause I hear they added a new filler arc right before the final battle lul. Art: 9 It one of the biggest anime all around the world. It would be too much if it didn't have good visuals. Didn't give it a 10/10 cause that Pain vs. Naruto fight was a pain to see ha ha ha..... Sound: 8 Naruto's voice kind of annoys me both in the dub and sub raspy voice. Sakura just annoys me but I attribute that more me no liking her in general. Character: 2 Ok. So Naruto I boy who has attention problems. Yea Yea he lost his parents but he didn't really start caring until he actually ""sees"" them. Frankly, he put all that attention into ramen jokes. Sasuke the emo crybaby. Let me make up an excuse to hate everything and then contradict myself and make myself look even more stupid. Sakura oh boy. ""I love the way you lie"" - eminem and rihanna. Sums up Sakura's thoughts I think we all know how that music video ended with (The fire burned everything and everyone). So Sasuke ended up having a child with her after he tried killing her, leaving for 2 years, planning to kill and destroy everything and everyone she loved. Yea oh and after that he then leaves her to be a single mother. Good job kiddo. Oh did I mention she is also useless. Overall: 6 While my review is only pointing out the flaws of this series I have to say I enjoyed my time with the Naruto series in general. Most of it is nostalgia cause Naruto was my gateway into more anime. Naruto is not a perfect anime. You can't give something a 10/10 if it has a flaw. Naruto has many flaws but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. We have to remember to actually set aside the nostalgia. Look at Boruto.. doesn't feel just like a quick cash. In conclusion I liked Naruto but as time went on it didn't hold up.

"I don't remember the exact last episode I watched, but this show is garbage and everyone should steer clear of it. I watched every episode of Naruto when they aired starting the year the show received an English dub. I stopped during the final arc of the show. I had highly enjoyed the show through much of it and I don't think I'd take those moments back. However, I cannot recommend this show whatsoever to anyone. The studio who made this show MILKED their FANS for money. The manga had been completed at the time the show decided to start running filler in the middle of their final arc. I have spent 7 years watching this show as a loyal fan and I stopped during the final arc. It's because the filler they started doing in the middle of the final arc lasted for over 2.5 years. I waiting 2 years to let episodes build up so my father and I could watch roughly 120 episodes together and binge it hard. There were only 3 canon episodes released within those 2.5 years and the manga had been finished that whole time, meaning the studio was purposely writing 2.5 years of filler to make money from view counts. It's absolutely disgusting. Then to top it all off they made the damn Boruto movie before they even finished the Naruto Shippuuden anime. I am so mad and disappointed. I will never watch another anime from this garbage studio again. Save yourself the trouble and watch a different studio's show.

"Naruto: Shippuden for me, is considered to be an era-defining show; It was something that was culturally influential for the time it was established and arguably STILL is to this day, and has helped shape what anime is generally today. Its by no means a perfect show, and that's what the detail of this review is for. But for what it is, it's something I do recommend people to watch and find themselves to invest their time in when they could. Animation (8/10) - This was a show that ran from 2007 - 2017; Standing the test of time generally, it's animation style is starting to become definitive for its time. It doesn't hurt the viewing experience that much imo, but I do have to say: In comparison to its continuation, Naruto (2002), this one have a noticeably better quality. The movements of the characters are more fluid, and has a more expressive tones onto it. I guess the only criticism I have is Studio Pierrot Co. (its producers), must've started slacking or doing budget cuts at the later parts of its run after The Great War arc concluded because its definition plummeted at around 480-500 episodes deep with some characters lacking details and shading as they used to. But for the majority of its run, I think they did a good job. Storyline (9/10) - Compared to Naruto (2002), this one has a much RICHER storyline. It still bottomlines on the occurrence of The Great War, but all the major arcs that leads slowly onto that progression is seriously action-packed and filled with sensational expositions. A lot of its side characters, especially the antagonists are also well-written in terms of their backstories, purposes and so, that you can't help but appreciate both the spectrum of good and evil as the conflicts unfolds. Also has a lot of blowing and major deaths so, keep your heads up for that. I guess one of the major flaw that I have that kept it from being a 10: Is the excruciating filler episodes and arcs they have. And sometimes they even come along in the MIDDLE of the main arc! As a breather I suppose or to extend their runtime? Idk but it's definitely annoying. Just like Naruto (2002), sometimes it would only be a couple of episodes which can be bearable but there are instances where it could span up to 10-12 eps or something. So it's like a Russian Roulette. And oftentimes those fillers don't even have any direct affect to the main story, so its basically just a waste of time. Definitely the drawback to its perfection. Music (9/10) - Having ten years of total time to simmer on the kitchen, it definitely had a lot of time to cook a lot of bangers and a versatile soundtrack library. It still has its trademark of Traditional Japanese-like thematic mostly on its background music that implements a rich flavor of woodwind, strings and percussion harmonies. But in terms of OSTs, it invested a lot on Japanese Rock which they did very well because a lot of the famous songs associated with the show came from this type of genre. Most notably Blue Bird, Silhouette, Sign and more, typically relying on fast-paced guitar riffs, crashing drums and snares, raw and energetic vocals into a singularity of a melody; The type of thing that would make your head bang and get drawn onto the tunes. Very lit, if you'd ask me. So props to that. Overall - 8.66 out of 10",9,Recommended,"Jun 9, 2025",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_624fe98859,22,3301
"Throughout the first part and all of Shippuden, I had to endure the stupid MC and disgusting personality Sakura, which is definitely a downside. But I started watching Naruto as a kid, so it would have been a shame not to check it out. I mostly watched it for characters like Kakashi, Madara, and Sai, because these characters are really interesting, use their brains, and have something to convey, unlike the two mentioned characters. Generally, the world and story are interesting. If Naruto came out now, I wouldn't watch it because of too many useless episodes, but I watched it because of nostalgia. 9/10, and of course, because of Madara, who remains one of the best ""villains"" in anime.I put the word 'villain' in quotation marks because his goal is the dream of every mature person a dystopia where people would be much happier than in the presented world",9,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 7, 2024",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1c2da3dfd5,22,863
"Naruto is my favorite anime of all time. I've been following it since 2010 and since then, I've watched many animes. Still, nothing compares to it. Attack on Titan may come as second, but it's no way near it. The theme is just too brilliant. It's something that never ever came into my mind. I really like the world of ninjas depicted in this show. I like the idea of Jutsu and Chakra. I love the fights. I love the backstories of each character. The characters' development is incredibly consistent. The show will fill you with many emotions: inspiring, charming, funny, sad, etc. The arcs and fights will blow your mind: it's strategic, a trait that many others lack; it's wholesome, not just punching around like a sh*t or throwing random powers like Dragon Ball and One Piece. I have too many favorite fights and arcs that make it impossible to list here, but the best one is certainly The Pain Invasion. That being said, sadly this amazing show has to suffer from many of what I call ""anime's fallacies"". They are defects that lower the anime's potential. These didn't happen very often, tho, gladly. But, I'm a very logical person, and I love to have a show to be logical if it's meant to be. - The main characters shall not be dead because we'll lose many fans / we cannot make up their subsequent story. - Forget about side characters, just let them be punching bags. - Mouthful during fights. The characters bother explaining his plot after defeating his opponent (they did this so that the viewer can also understand, but it's nonsense. It should be explained with flashback). - Show the greatness of the villain by nerfing (making weak) the good characters. - The level of power has to increase dramatically over time (you know, in the Naruto series, kunai and shuriken were still a weapon to kill enemies. In Shippuden, they were just an adornment). The first fallacy makes many illogical events happen. (spoiler alert! skip this paragraph if you haven't watched yet). Because of the author's insistence on keeping the main characters alive, Gaara and Kakashi had to be revived by some weird Jutsu. Choji and Ino didn't die after being suffocated by Kakuzu. Sasuke didn't die after being stabbed by Madara on his heart. All five kages didn't die after being knocked down by Madara. C'mon, have the courage to kill them. Did Death Note lose his fanbase after killing L, its favorite character? Did AOT lose after killing Sasha and Captain Erwin? The last fallacy is what I dislike most. It went from Zabuza's level -> Pain's level -> Madara's level -> Kaguya's level. In the last arc, they were just fighting against aliens and throwing a bunch of unknown jutsus, making the show like Dragon Ball which really undermined strategy. I have no idea why Kishi had this in mind. I hope it stopped at Madara's level where the fights were still consumable. All in all, I don't find any anime without defects. If Kishi had the second chance to remake this show, I think it'll become unequivocally the greatest anime ever.",9,Recommended,"Jan 21, 2023",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_1dde28b1ca,22,3024
"This anime is by far my favorite, and I don't think there'll be anything that will surpass it. Though, I will admit it isn't overall perfect, but what anime is. All that matters that in my eyes I believe it to be the best and that's my opinion. Story- 9/10 The story in Shippuden, while not extremely complex like some anime, it still contains underlying tones and messages in its arcs that make you think. It starts off immediately into an entertaining arc that once it starts the series never looks back. There wasn't an arc that I can say I didn't enjoy (excluding filler), some are even my favorite arcs in all of anime, and while they mainly dealt with Naruto and Sasuke, the arcs also gave other characters development and growth that you don't see in a lot of series. The results of each arc are felt and have lasting effects on the characters and me as a viewer. Some arcs made me cry, some cheer, and some even caused me to reflect on life. Character deaths are meaningful and aren't something that are just brushed past, they are talked about and impact the series the rest of the show. The world is expanded upon and so is the lore that makes a somewhat smaller world larger and enhances it in the process. Art- 8.5/10 The animation in this show is its weakest point, but I wouldn't call it a negative. There are moments where you can see the flaws in certain scenes, where characters are making weird faces. Other than that the animation is good and the fight scenes are very well done with the visuals looking extremely good and the characters animated well. The fight scenes especially are amazing, with the attacks looking great, and the choreography of the fights can be among the best. Sound- 10/10 The ost for Shippuden is among the best with emotional scenes being enhances by the background music, the fights feeling more intense because of it, and the comedic scenes better. So, the soundtrack does what it's supposed to do, enhances the overall anime. It is also, so good that I listen to a lot of them in my free time outside of watching the anime. Characters- 10/10 Now we are on the strongest point of Shippuden, the cast of characters. Naruto and Sasuke are my favorite characters in anime, along with a couple of the supporting characters being in my top 20. Naruto and Sasuke are very well layered characters that change with what they experience around them, making them feel very human. Their bond is also something to love because they are the best pair of characters in anime, with how they interact with each other. Then, there's the supporting cast like; Kakashi, Shikamaru, Might Guy, Jiraiya, etc. Most get developed, some more than others, but it helps make you care more about these characters and what they go through in the story. Lastly there's the villains, which are also extremely strong characters, who have their own backstories and reasons for what they do. It makes you understand them, sympathize with them, and even agree with some of the points that they make. So, overall the characters are one of the major reasons that I enjoyed Shippuden. Enjoyment- 10/10 If you couldn't tell based off of what I wrote before this, I enjoy Shippuden to the fullest degree. Enough that I re-watched it twice and still got the same enjoyment out of it that I had the first time I watched it. Overall- 10/10 So, overall I think that this is the best anime out there. Obviously this is my opinion and everyone has a right to their own. However, I request that you give it a chance if you haven't already, and I hope you get the same enjoyment out of it as I did.",10,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_4ae4956ac7,22,3597
"I love the Naruto franchise... and Shippuden Just solidified that fact for me!!! Naruto is a challenging exploration of themes such as the cycle of hatred, war, comradery, and peace. Through its expressive and varied cast of characters, it paints a vivid picture of the world in which they inhabit. This rich world is further brought to life by the gorgeous sound design and visuals. Shippuden truly is a sensory treat. And I haven't even started on the characters. Kishimoto works best in creating memorable and fresh character dynamics that keep you drawn to the screen. In particular the dynamic between Naruto and Pain is a masterclass in storytelling, not only being highly enjoyable, but also deeply tying into the show's themes... ...is what I would say if I were a CHUMP!

"I will keep this short: Manga 10/10 Games 10/10 (they are much better then even manga) Anime 4/10 Once again the filler percentage is around 41% with ethe same problems as the Naruto Part 1 anime. Fillers don't give us nothing new to overall story, and exist only to overstretch the anime livespan. When anime adapts the story from the manga it's really perfect, but when the filler arrives it simply downgrades.I did even put a higher score because this show started to adapt some of light novels, but if you're watching this anime weekly it was impossible to tell the difference back then. For the manga it's really a shonen classic at this point of time. The Storm games did even surpass the manga with the showcase of the final bosses fights (Naruto Shippuden opening 8 reference is the best example).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 9, 2022",Naruto,Naruto Shippuden,1735,naruto_shippuden_c82e96b245,22,805

"There are two responses I get, without fail, every time I try to get someone new to watch this show. ""I don't like the art style"" or ""I've seen the dub - NO THANKS."" I'm guilty of both of these myself. But if there's one thing I need to stress before even getting started on this review, it's that the 4Kids dub is NOT One Piece. For the love of god, PLEASE do not think it is. If you've suffered the misfortune of seeing some of the 4Kids episodes, just erase them from your mind and start fresh. They butchered it, there's really no other way to put it. They cut episodes, changed the dialogue to fit a MUCH younger and apparently far less intelligent audience (almost insultingly so), gave the characters RIDICULOUS voices, and pretty much watered down the entire series. FUNimation has done a much better job so far from what I've seen, but regardless, watching it in its original Japanese form with subtitles is really the way to go. As for the art style, it's true, it's completely different from almost anything else I've seen. Much more ""cartoonish"" and maybe not what you'd expect from an anime. Despite that, you end up loving it. I wouldn't even say that you have to ""get used to it"" because it's not something that detracts from the rest of the series in any way. It didn't even take me two episodes before I was thoroughly enjoying it and seeing it as a fresh, new style, exciting almost and unlike anything I'd experienced before. Now, some 300+ episodes later, I can't remember ever NOT liking it, or even why I would have. Especially now with One Piece being aired in high definition, the art is crisp, clean, colorful - VERY sharp and wonderful to look at. Now that we've got those two points out of the way... One Piece is actually one of the best shows I've ever seen, anime or otherwise. The plot is pretty basic at first. Monkey D. Luffy has just set out on his own to find the legendary treasure 'one piece' and become Pirate King, and he's looking for a crew to sail with him. You'll find yourself falling in love with each and every new member as Luffy finds them. They're all extremely well developed, with interesting backgrounds and unique, fun personalities. They form one very quirky crew that's always discovering new adventures and somehow getting themselves into trouble as they strive to achieve their dreams. Each main story arc introduces new minor characters as well, and they're just as much fun and easy to fall in love with as the Straw Hat crew. Not one character is left out or feels like they're there for no reason. Everyone has a purpose and adds to the storyline, and one of the really cool things about One Piece is that these 'purposes' often resurface at later points in the series. No detail is left untouched, and you'll seriously be amazed by the way Oda threads together plots and characters and blends all their stories perfectly the more the series progresses. The plot itself, though fairly straightforward at first like I said, quickly evolves into something HUGE. Much of the beginning of the series is dedicated to forming the crew and letting you get to know the characters, though it's definitely never lacking in action, but once they reach the Grand Line, you're swept up in adventure after adventure and following some of the most fantastic story arcs you'll ever watch. The battles and fights are well-paced, with the final boss fight almost always being completely EPIC. But even through the action, One Piece never quite loses it's lighthearted, humorous edge. The episodes are sprinkled with PLENTY of funny moments, never too many and never too few. There's always a wonderful balance of action and humor. One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA. In a word, One Piece is perfect. And perhaps I'm just biased, being an obviously OBSESSED fan at this point, haha, but what can I say? It's been running for 344 episodes so far and not ONCE have I wondered or hoped that it would start to reach an end. It is, simply put, amazing. So why should you watch One Piece? Because you're missing out on one hell of a fantastic show if you don't at least give it a try.",10,Recommended,"Feb 28, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fe533a003c,1,4998
"Warning: Minor Spoilers If I were to say anything bad (and I will have to do that as this review is not a positive one) about this anime that would not offend the hardcore fans (and I know there are a lot) is that it's PAINFULLY slow. Even if you leave the fillers aside, still- the plot itself progresses in such a slow pace that it's rather hard to watch. Now for a younger audience it may not matter that much, but to me as a higher age audience, it matters greatly, after all, out of the 23~ minutes of each episode 3 are spent on opening and ending (which is usual I guess), but in most episodes, roughly 5 (!) or more minutes are spent on a recap of the current story arc, as if the creators of the show forgot it's a shounen anime and instead got the idea that the audience are elderly people with Alzheimer. But ok, this means there is still 15 minutes left per episode right? Well, not really. In most episodes, the heroes get separated. When they do, the anime tries to keep track of ALL of them simultaneously, cutting every few minutes. This wouldn't be so bad IF after the cut, the same exact scene did not repeat itself (example - a few seconds that show one of the main heroes standing and looking at a place/ villain that is shown from a few angles. Then the anime continues elsewhere, and when it comes back to the same place, the same exact scene is shown). That may not sound as much, but in drastic cases that can sum up to a few minutes (the worst case I bothered to count was almost 4 minutes of time wasted on watching the same scene). Combined with a lot of other tricks, I'd say that a lot of episodes are left with about 11 minutes of actual content on average. That is simply dreadful. Now to say some positive things for contrast- the story is actually very interesting and the characters are well done... BUT, no matter how good something is, if you drag it out too much (and this is indeed the case with One Piece), even the best story in the world and the best characters possible (not to say one piece has neither of those.. The story is great, and the characters are good, but not more) will not keep you entertained, and turn even the best story possible into a boring experience. Now back to the negatives. NO ONE DIES IN THIS ANIME. This is of course an exaggeration, as some people actually do die in this anime BUT only when it's critical to the plot. At all the other times, the characters ""die"" just to add drama and to come back a few scenes later.. Sometimes to ""die"" again and add even more ""drama"" (added """" because at this point its more awkward/silly after one time rather than dramatic). The worst case of this I saw was with Brownbeard who ""died"" something like 5 times over 2-3 episodes (if I remember right), and still stayed alive in the end while the show tried to suck as much drama out of this as possible. And this brings me to the next point- fake drama. They seem to try and squeeze out as much of it as possible, at every opportunity they get. From crying children (and adults) to characters repeatedly ""dying"" and to the most cliche tearjerkers possible at every turn of the story. They even go as far as to try and make the villain's henchmen AND EVEN THE VILLAIN himself have a tragic past that you are supposed to relate to and feel sorry for (because seems a villain can't just be evil because that is just the way he is, he had to become evil because something bad happened (lol, how about sheer ignorance or plain greed for wealth or power?)... and we apparently MUST know. for both villains and side characters that we'll never even see again). Also I mentioned crying.. There is an unbelievable amount of it in this anime. And that would be ok (I guess) if A- they did not try to milk it for drama (yep, that's a word that sure gets a lot of use when discussing this anime huh?) every single time B- they didn't think that when someone cries, he instantly turns ugly, with snot running down his nose and with the worst face expression possible, regardless of gender, age or how emotional he is. I'd say a lot more, but there is already a lot of text, and it's enough to sum it up - this anime is not one I would recommend someone to watch under any normal circumstances (maybe only if someone made a shortened version with all the repeats, openings, endings and cuts removed thus making the whole anime be at around 300 episodes max), I watched over 600 episodes myself, and I can safely say that although some parts were enjoyable, it was mostly rather boring when looked as a whole, and especially the later episodes, and I am regretting the time I spent watching it (as to why i watched it so far- my friend recommended it to me and I did not expect it to last this long. I usually finish what I start, but this is ridiculous, bad, and really beyond me at this point.)",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 3, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8713a59253,1,4838
"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.",10,Recommended,"Sep 12, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33b6ca576d,1,5567
"Review In short, I'm Going to keep it real with you all that you would obviously see my score that i gave One Piece. Well, That is why in my review I'm going to go over these factors as to why this isn't worth your time so that I can save you a life line. So for that You are welcome. (This Applies To Manga Also in case your wandering) Anyway I have Dropped this series for many reasons alone that I did to where I was watching and Investing my time with this and its pretty simple why that is and why It made sense for me to review One Piece. Firstly Its very easy to base this series on the analogy of this being a shonen adventure series yes, however what continues to irk at my own viewing experience of watching this for a long while now and to put it simply if I were to sum up this series in a nutshell It would be summed up in 4 words...(Typical Forced Annoying Tendencies) To empathize my point much further, This anime has dragged onto the point where I know longer care where the story is heading now because its writer Oda Eiichiro unfortunately likes to Time waste WAY too often in his writing of milking hundreds of episodes of this series of its so called world building and brain wash a lot of its Japanese audience as well as those that following the whole over saturated popular shonen trend in the process to the point that the fans themselves have overate this anime in general in its own category. Literally the story has not changed to any degree where a new plot can be implemented differently in its approach which sadly isn't the case let alone can the story mature with its premise as this is still following the same freaking formula of a repetitive lame shonen nonsense of its character troupes with most of its episodes from 1 to god knows what episode its currently on right now so far which I really question if this anime just wants the viewers attention just because of its length that can still be milked because of it? OR does it want to be a pirate adventure shonen that can integrate an effort into its story and characterizations? Well at this point I can easily tell you that both completely Suck at making these traits realized in Oda's craft which is not engaging my viewing of the same formula with many random added coincidences that luffy and strawhats encounter on their journey and with that has lost more credibility in claiming that this is an anime about pirates in general which is even more ridiculous throughout and for the longest time after a while I just found this series to be rather boring and predictable in its long tedious dragged out boring narrative. (Btw, Nothing to do with just its length or its terrible look in general) I honestly got to ask those currently watching or even reading One piece Do you really like to enjoy the same old tropes and jokes over and over again that includes many long pointless plot elements that have many cons for milking their story and character for its own purpose?? Its Just like how the Naruto franchise lost credibility thinking its own series depicts ninjas in its own way to show the struggle taking place for nonjas old and young in its own viewing in the show which shows in both naruto and one piece over time what it has lost through its extended transition in both their writing of these concepts. As a shonen anime Its these glaring flaws that just keeps continuing on and on. That in terms of its story, characterization, progression, writing, enjoyment and any replay value what so ever for a shonen experience which becomes blatantly obvious that it fails! especially when some claim this to be the definitive shonen anime experience of a grand adventure. (Oh Dear.) There are 2 clear things fans will use to defend this show by saying don't be put off by the shows length or its dumb cartoony animation and secondly dont be put off with the handling of the material in the way Toei Animation handles this so instead read the manga, And to that I say.. NONSENSE! Since the show already has a lot problems already that fans seem to gloss over. You see, Reading its Guinness book of its trash manga doesn't even help or even give me value for reading through for what has loads of the same problems as I've mentioned above. If that wasn't enough of an issue. Its story of its characters and its events always end up feeling pretty much the same Forced Melodramatic story in its writing that you have seen and heard loads of times and only forces you to endure this along with bad side stories that contribute into an even SLOWER pace for this show in each of its build up with each Arc that by over hundreds and hundreds of episodes later by then it totally becomes unacceptable, By then I don't blame certain people out there for skipping chunks of its story now and then. (Trust me, Having tolerance for this anime should be the least of your worries here people.) For me going through each arc to arc in a easy going manner that I approach most anime through my viewing You'd expect that this would be casual thing of ease for me right? No sweat? WRONG, It didn't guarantee me as a viewer any love or charm what so ever to a lot of its characters like the time you are first introduce to them in the series. Instead it only just copies and paste stuff mostly of the same scenarios that you would see far too often in this series for most if not all of these characters and YES that does includes the main crew along with their progression except for some few in the straw hat crew that show to get more abilities than others really makes it fair in its togetherness doesn't it? (Some bonding that is if you ask me?, since only a few certain characters with plot armour that can do certain things most others couldn't do) Even when uniting the straw hats together only just makes it for a more cheesier affair most of the time when you would obviously expect it Especially when it comes off as cliche as it does. Which also regards to parts where one piece at some parts wants to go dark its already so desperate to up the ante that a blind Ray Charles can easily tell from miles away that its only going to result into a similar conclusion like before. I mean come on! its way past most of the amount of standard shonen episodes! which reminds me of Detective Conan, However in Conan's case the Difference is between these 2 series is in its Fandoms. One Piece fans try to Over hype the crap out of this which is really unnecessary even when lots of people know clearly that it is the case. A terrible excuse for making points along this series own progression just because its stretched out as it has been for the premise inexcusably which is a joke for those who try to justify this notion. Look, We already got the basic gist of things going on in this series from the beginning, Even through its dumb world building and set up and even till now is still not even well structured since it throws random places for us to be distracted so that fillers can help maintain its bad pace let alone does it even make that much sense to begin with especially when trying to use foreshadowing to justify the ridiculous amount of episodes that is in this series as it is to make us feel like we have feel invested in the unknown mysteries of the show which actually does the opposite effect. I believe the one piece fandom have gotten mixed up with what world building actually is with the amount of episodes there have been especially focusing on stuff that this show thinks I should see but I don't and no I don't need to have to skip arcs just to enjoy something, Why should I? that is just retarded. Is that why its Manga counterpart is in the Guinness book of records because of its pacing and complacency? Makes sense for whatever parts of this series gains popularity in much of its story for being pointlessly repetitive i suppose. 1. First off regarding what I've mentioned so far, If you have an immersive world and there is already enough content in the story/journey in your world building never mind how vast or mysterious it is, Don't pointlessly drag it out instead USE IT! and stop milking it with stupid character expressions of coincidences full of plot devices and plot armour, I do not care that it is a dumb shonen. At least FMA knew this a lot better. 2. Pointless prologues to your episodes. 3. Bad morals in many different situations of the story with its writing. 4. Stupid journey objectives that hardly revolves around the plot of the treasure of one piece until HUNDREDS AND I MEAN HUNDREDS of episodes later on to the point which is unacceptable along with milking its main characters most of the time of this franchise that gets to the point where it feels like its turning into filler which by the way there are a lot of them no matter what fans try to say against this. 5. Dumb fanservice depictions of its females making video games like dead or alive and Onechanbara look a lot more tolerable. 6. Stop foreshadowing something in the story that was mentioned hundreds and hundreds of episodes ago as its not good story telling neither is it clever in any way since it never justifies its consistency for constantly dragging on in the way it does. 7. Over hyping stronger characters that don't really get involve in the story that much anyway. 8. Its lame music score that should sound great but it doesn't. 9. Most of the times bad animation no doubt, AKA Toei Animation VERY LAZY INDEED and are swimming in pools of Yen around them like fat sewer Rats. 10. Devil fruits abilities in the way with any other devil fruits that are demonstrated looks stupid and nonsensical to the overall balance and power scaling with variations of different class devil fruit users, which in term of supposedly creating unpredictability and uniqueness to a devil fruit user's abilities only serves to unfortunately create a convoluted mess of an explanation of devil fruit powers in general to those that are Logia, Paramecia and Zoan in their own element even in terms of their weakness which is badly depicted on in the show. 11. Haki creates a lot of bullcrap deus ex machinas later on as an excuse of not explaining a lot about devil fruits all that well and lots of times is used mainly for plot armour for certain characters of the writer's choice which is lazy nor does it add anything new to the battle scaling in fights more like unneeded add ons. 12. its voice acting well its just mostly tedious and over the place nothing great or over the top despite how Oda writes the story (Bad writing Btw) that even after listening to lot of these characters it just makes me want to listen to a dying mule instead. Nothing weird or wonderful about that my friends. With all that being said, Its only qualities that I like about one piece are the art designs of certain characters and the fact there is a series that stars pirates, since there are very few anime series that have pirates (not that they are suppose to be role models in any way) but those are the only positives with this series in general for me and honestly nothing more. Overall its an over exaggerated series of repetitive outcomes that I have not enjoyed in its long run about dumb wannabe pirates quote PIRATES! It's only real positive here is HEY ITS ABOUT PIRATES WOW THATS RARE TO FIND IN ANIME ISN'T IT???..WRONG BECAUSE CONSIDERING WHAT PIRATES ARE LIKE IN REAL LIFE WHO CARES ANYWAYS. That is like me wanting to write a story about slavery on different Ethnicity/Races but NOOOOOOO............. that won't be right, so why not glorify slave traders into being these nice dumb heroes? because you know It sounds interesting right? RIGHT??... WELL WRONG AGAIN. Now going back to my point of Watching this crappy cartoon this only makes me or most viewers seem to have to glorify such a pathetic outlook of a premise with its stretched out world building that is not even incisive enough to its history of the story, neither is it memorable for me enough to even care about it to watch it any longer as it doesn't reward me growth in their characters, a decisive objective or consistency of its so called journey within its story in general. Last but not least The fights really suck! seriously do yourselves a Big favour there are better Shonens and many other Animes out there that is worth watching that has better characters, better story, better pacing and better growth than this long turd of a show that seems to overate a lot in Japan above others which unfortunately is the world we live in today. Consider this dropped and good riddance. Excuse me for being honestly critical as I am as I do not sugar coat a series if that is what you really wanted about this show in general, well too bad. You can go to other reviewers that are giving out tens towards this Overrated piece of fiction that's overstayed it's welcome.

"Lets start with the story. Story. 2/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Art. 3/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. Enjoyment. 5/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... overall this series is mostly full of gag you should not take it seriously if you do you're only going to be disappointed so the series isn't the worst series I've ever watch. So if you want a series to laugh at, I would 100% recommend one piece to you all.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 21, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_84fcfc02fe,1,1642
"In my personal opinion, One Piece is one of those animes that is easy to love and is just as easy to hate. Funnily enough, those who love One Piece love it for exactly the same reasons that others hate it; the extreme characters, zany abilities, and classic artstyle all contribute to both sides. This review's goal is neither to covince you to love One Piece, nor is it the opposite. The review merely expresses my own personal views of the series. And by the way, this review is based upon the original Japanese version. If you have had the bad luck of viewing the 4Kids dubbed version, you have my heartfelt condolences. Right, well, anyway, moving on... PLOT: The story of One Piece mostly consists of the Straw Hat Pirates traveling from island to island and having crazy adventures. Although each crewmember has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: to reach the end of the treacherous Grand Line. Bound by this promise, they pass through unbelievable adventures. Given this pattern, you would think the plot would get boring and predictable, right? Amazingly enough, unlike shonen anime with similar plot devices, One Piece manages to become less and less predictable as its plot advances. As it advances, it also delves into serious situations. There is actually much tragedy involved with One Piece, but the show maintains a balance of comic relief as well. I've actually been driven to tears many times while watching this show, but I've laughed out loud just as many times, if not more. ART: One Piece's art style is one of the elements that turns many people off to the series. The style is fairly old-school, remniscent of 90's shows like Dragonball Z. Then again, I guess One Piece started out in the late 90's, too, so that's to be expected. Either way, the quality of the animation steadily improves as the show moves along. The show is now broadcast in HD, and the quality simply blows me away with every new episode. But the show's animation style remains the same, just greatly improved in terms of quality. After all, with a show as crazy as One Piece, modern animation styles just wouldn't fit. I simply cannot imagine Monkey D. Luffy with eyes like Uzumaki Naruto; it simply does not work. SOUND: I absolutely adore the music of One Piece. There are so many different kinds of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, angry, confused, funny, sleepy, scared, epic, cryptic, foreboding, intense, etcetera, etcetera. For each of these situations, there is a unique musical piece which plays in the background. What's more is that each character has their own style of music and their own theme. Whenever I hear a background song, I immediately know what's going on, and fall into the according state of mind. It happens subconsciously, and it adds to both the predictability and spontaneity of the show. If Zoro's 'epic' music begins to play, he may still lose his current battle. However, whenever I hear that music, I immediately know, ""Zoro is going to dominate in this scene,"" regardless of whether or not he actually does. CHARACTERS: I cannot think of enough synonyms for ""incredible"" to sufficiently describe One Piece's character development, so I'll just say that it's definitely SUPER!!! Ahahaha...yeah, that was a reference to the show...anyway, the characters of One Piece are one of its major selling points. In fact, it was the characters, not the story, that hooked me to this show. Each character has their own personal reason for sailing the Grand Line and for joining the Straw Hat Pirates, and this goal pushes them to new heights with each passing adventure. This goal is backed by an emotionally engrossing backstory which usually can encompass more than two episodes. I have been moved to tears by so many touching flashbacks I no longer possess enough fingers to count them all. The characters are all very personable as well, and are the one aspect of One Piece you can nearly always predict. You always know Luffy will be Luffy, and Usopp will be Usopp. Never would you expect Sanji to suddenly lash out at Nami, but you would certainly expect Nami to lash out at everyone else. Do not misunderstand me; I am not implying that the characters of One Piece are static. They are all decidedly not static. By comparing the current Luffy with the Luffy of the first few episodes, you can discern an obvious difference. The same holds true for all of the crewmembers. Yet the changes take place gradually over time, not all at once. That is my favorite part of this anime. Just like actual humans, the One Piece characters develop new traits and discard old traits, but always remain the same person they were when first introduced. ENJOYMENT: When trying to convince my friends that they should watch One Piece (mostly so I can discuss the latest episodes with them), I inevitably have to ask myself why I personally enjoy the series. And then I am stumped. I mean, I could say all the above and people still wouldn't be satisfied. There would be people asking, ""Well, why do you like that kind of plot? I saw this one show that had a different kind and I liked it."" How am I supposed to respond to that!? That's the equivalent of saying, ""Why do you like chocolate ice cream? I like vanilla, and it's way better."" Whether you enjoy something or not all depends on how your brain is wired and your attitude when you try it. Just because I love One Piece doesn't mean you will, and just because someone hates One Piece doesn't mean I have to. Erm...I kind of got on a rant. Ehehehe...uh, yeah. So, I enjoy One Piece because of the above reasons. Is...that all I'm supposed to put here? It seems inadequate for some reason... OVERALL: In conclusion, I find One Piece to be epic! Whether you do or don't, please don't discount it for any reason until you've actually begun watching it. While I can attest to the fact that the story doesn't really become exciting until the crew reaches the Grand Line, the material before that is still crucial to the rest of the story, and is still very enjoyable. Oh, and as a matter of precaution, DO NOT WATCH THE 4KIDS DUB! If you do, then you may very well suffer severe damage to your cerebral cortex. If you must watch the show in English, I recommend the FUNimation dub. Their DVDs contain about 13 episodes each, and are available wherever you buy your anime. I forget how much they cost...well, you can Google it if you really want to.",10,Recommended,"May 17, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bd61445051,1,6432
"OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! From a scale of ""over 9000"" to ""too damn high"", how excited am I, you say? Well, judging from watching this garbage, I'd say a 9 will suffice for the after effect. I like it, but in all honesty, it's not good. So, to begin my review, let me start of my experience of watching OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!! Please do understand this is not me taking shots at this series in any way, this is just me expressing my views on the show in terms of its merits and failings to see if its as great as fans really suggest this to be. For a long time you see I've watched the series of One Piece back on television during the great Toonami era which basically is The western TV version of saying HELLO JAPAN!! The dub for 4kids was what I watched at first and no surprise it deserved it at the time, because the show wasn't that special from the get go from when it started off to where it's currently at now with DOH Flippin Flamingo. And yes, I went to Funimation and the Japanese for their take on its characters voice and music etc. which still did not make any difference apart from seeing some dumb unrealistic violence and yet the show still hasn't grown up to where I am now in the series, it could be possibly I'm not acknowledging the show in the right way despite that I'm still watching it or maybe Oda just isn't Goda anymore. OH NOOO! THE HORROR!! The basic story premise is about pirates with super fruity power ups known as Devil Fruits (Laughing excessively here at this point). More to it lies with our main character Monkey D Luffy a wannabe young man who wants to be king of the pirates. (Wow had no idea there was royalty to begin with pirates but oh well) Luffy strings up a group of people to join his pirate crew within different arcs of the story to help in searching for a treasure known as OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!! that was foretold by the greatest pirate known as Gold D Rodgers who apparently hides the treasure in the Grand Line (because that's the name of the big game I guess?) and by the time our hair turns grey we might actually find out as to why and what it is (that is either you or Oda stays alive until then.) At the time of Gold D Rodger's death sentence, he makes his last infinite statement that he says he left everything in OnePiIISSWuaaaa! Oh yes! Gotta love that D, eh Boys and Girls? So far in the midst of everything, the story tries its hardest to keep building up and gets messed up at an early point right after 50 episodes which was supposed to be its greatest strength but also becomes its greatest weakness. You probably won't believe me for saying this but that weakness being is WORLD BUILDING. Basically what I mean by that is that it is constantly dragging on episodes to make you feel that you are on a long journey of some sorts but in reality, all it really is doing is STALLING on the part of the mangaka Oda Eiichiro's Art design and writing for whatever wage he seems to be earning on demand at the moment and yes, it's fact since the industry supposedly is hard on the condition of writers on a weekly basis. In other words, the PACING OF THIS ANIME IS AWFUL. Sounds familiar?? It's pretty much very similar to Hunter X Hunter mangaka Togashi Yoshihiro's approach in the story that constitutes for being excessively greedy in its approach, then again quite a lot of Shounen animes are like that, I guess. It's like the anime is holding up a sign saying: HEY NOTICE US PLEASE!! PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF US! OR WE'LL KEEP SLOWING DOWN FOR WE SEEK THE ATTENTION!!!! Anyway, enough of the issue at hand before some of you start feeling like I'm trying too hard to be negative on purpose. Think to yourself THIS, if this was such a great shounen for examples like Death Note or even FMA Brotherhood why the need for SO many episodes?? Why am I so serious..?? Very simple answer. Again it's World building, which demands many SLOW pacing in a lot of episodes, so much so that they probably need LOADS of spin off specials and movies like you haven't watched enough of this already as it is in and outside of this franchise, (also referring to Japanese one piece merchandise of course.) By the time you get your toys at whatever time period this show continues, you ALL would of already grown out of this at some stage in your life unless your an Otaku then fair enough. This is no rant here, I'm only stating the obvious critical point towards the show as a whole. But like I mentioned, it's because of this World Building this leads to the major reason why the story at most becomes tedious and below mediocre at best on a consistent level in almost EVERY Arc. Oh, and also FILLERS! Whether the fandom wants you to know or not know, there are a lot of filler characters which also includes badly forced gags for no progressive purposes except for you to question say ''Hey maybe I should watch something else for the time being,'' and me being an honest critic of this generation I will gladly say this, that you should not be force to be put through too much of the same stuff that you don't really want to SEE in a long series like this. Can we be honest and say for any anime watchers out there that loads of episode can harm World building because of timing and pacing problems such as this? When you are chock full of content like this, it should be constructed and executed better! Never mind the BS on the whole it started in the 90s kinda nonsense. YOU have the content for viewers to be engaged in the show, yet this anime stretches out the same shit you already witness before without some even realising it (Naruto I'm looking at you on this notion here). So, don't go into this series thinking there ain't gonna be any fillers because I can most assure you there are, and quite a lot of them even if some of the extreme fandom don't seem to believe so. The Art is okay and at the same time can look very BAD in terms of the details of a lot of characters. Marines look stupid and quite similar to one another and just well fodder really and females in this series turn out to have the same physique as every other hourglass shaped female in the show. Wait, is this fairy tail?? (Oh boy I might of hit the nail on that one) Big tall men have extremely wide bodies and extremely skinny legs for no reason, at least Whitebeard is the more convincing one out of them. Other characters which includes non human characters look ridiculous and just too nonsensical to be taken seriously, no matter what dragon ball like power they seem to possess. Almost like I'm watching a Disney cartoon back in the day if it was on LSD. Znd for the love of god, why is Usopp's nose like THAT?? I don't care what third dimension of Disney this is supposed to be? THIS does not appeal to me, thank you. Now on to The Power schemes and structures of OnePiIISSWuaaaa! such as: Paramecia: Body manipulation over their own bodies, environment, or produce substances. Logia: Having the power of natural elements or force of nature. Zoan: Transformation of species and inter-species hybrid forms at will. Ah, you would think this category would be solid? While some powers in the series I'll admit can be used to good effect, others can look completely ridiculous and nonsensical even in their own category which for the most part makes the power balance of this series even more unbalanced. Oh and lastly, Haki AKA (Haki of the Color of the Conquering King): Domination of the wills of others is the dumbest made up BULLSHIT! in the entirety of this franchise. ""Oh wow Conquerors Haki! OMG! That guy just looked at another person and that person fell DOWN!! OMG!!"" Seriously? NO SERIOUSLY, don't get me started talking about the different fighting styles in this series, it's lame and not worth mentioning for they are like an excuse for characters that have to fight for the sake of having fights as their only true purpose and nothing more. Villains in this show are typically One dimensional; they the kind of villains that likes to display cruel tendencies to other characters that you really wouldn't care for, BUT I guess because the straw hats appear (Oh Whoopie), you are forced to unfortunately. At times, it can seem somewhat tiresome, especially if you are already familiar with this Shounen pattern again and again and again and AGAIN. How long has this series been going on for? (No Seriously) So, now on to characters where the show for the most part kind of develops, but only due to back stories to further a fully purposed plot for them later on from the get go, but it never really makes ground breaking attempts to carry along in this stride in every arc which is a real shame. So this wouldn't really be shocking up to this point, ESPECIALLY if you have already watched a shit ton of episodes till the current episode you are at right now. Main Characters, The simple short version. Luffy: IMO, as the Lead character he is one of the most uninspiring main character leads I've ever seen in shounen he has 2 fixated moods DUMBASS Or Constipated Raging Man child. Take your pick. Zoro: He is useless following directions making the punt of his efforts in lots of situations where he is lost at every turn very stupidly which in turn leaves his three swords style. But then who cares when you see characters like Killer Bee from naruto who uses his own 8 swords style? So right off the bat, what is so impressive about this 3 swords style? Haki Right? The only answer to just about anything dumb in this show, that's cool, I get it. Sanji: He is basically Brock from pokemon as he is just a generic character who tries to be a hit with the ladies and never gets any including that he is also a chef and STILL never gets ANY WOMAN. Poor bastard. Franky: I guess you can say he is the Cyborg technician of the ship who thinks he is SUPER MANLY but most of the time he is just a complete Super douche mentally and physically speaking. Nami: She is Tragic navigator turned tragic Fan service, which gets dudes thirsting ''Where's that Nami hentai at!!??"" Chopper: I don't want to know any further about this annoying Doctor. Brook: Probably my favourite straw-hat pirate out of them all, but Oda sometimes devalues his character like others. Nico Robin: She is Tomb Raider but with a cool ability, if I might add. And to be fair, I liked the back stories of the characters. However, what I didn't like was over using the same sad theme for each of their themes with streams of over exaggerated tears. (talk about milking moments like these here to give people quickly them feels, which gets old really fast.) As for the sound department, it's lacking but by no means bad, it suits whatever mood you could be feeling in this long ass snail pace of a series. The voice acting quality were few and not so many. Animation wise, it can look really decent when they put there time into it like marineford for example, and a lot of other times can look pretty abysmal most of the time according to Toei Animation. Overall am I enjoying this series? I am trying to, but because of those obvious glaring flaws on the surface still exist just like the treasure OnePiIISSWuaaaa!!!!! I'll admit I have put this on hold during the arc of Doh Flippin Flamingo because I still intend to finish what I started. Otherwise why go in over 600 episodes deep just to drop it? You see I'm a watcher not a reader of forever long manga, so I intend to keep it that way plus I have no time for comparisons between the anime and manga I have better stuff to do in my long life so I leave you with this. If you want the most silliest longest Shounen adventure ongoing where everything changes with the times except this then by all means give this a shot you might end up loving it, just not in the same way it has been for me. I can be sure I'm probably not the only one.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 24, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1e4ce16e1a,1,11793
"One Piece recounts the story of Monkey D Luffy, a young man who wishes to become the Pirate King; and the rest of the crew of the Mugiwara ('Straw Hat') Pirate crew, each of whom join the crew to realise lifelong dreams of their own. Luffy ate a Devil's Fruit as a child, more accurately the 'Gomu Gomu' fruit (gomu means 'rubber'), thus his body took on the form of rubber, enabling him to stretch and inflate himself at will - though the downside for anybody who eats a Devil's Fruit is that they can no longer swim: something of a disadvantage for a pirate. Luffy is a bit of of a unique character in all of the anime series I have watched: he's not smart, but he's not stupid. Perhaps 'simple' is the best way of describing him, as he has the same thoughts and ideals no matter what the situation is, sees no reason in pretending to be something he isn't, and often has trouble adjusting his fun-loving character to act appropriately in serious circumstances. Although he is the captain of the Mugiwara Pirates, he is pretty much held in line by the rest of his crew, especially Nami. He does, however, usually get the final word. Luffy's aim is to become Pirate King and to claim the ultimate treasure that the old and greatest Pirate King, Gol D Roger, announced at his execution was at the end of the Grand Line: the most dangerous, treacherous and feared ocean in the world. This treasure, 'One Piece', gives the series its name. It is yet unknown exactly what One Piece is, or what it does. However, with every island of the Grand Line that the crew traverse (the only way to sail the Grand Line being to hop from one island to the next) they are one stop closer to finding Gol D Roger's heritage. The rest of the Mugiwara Crew consists of characters just as well-rounded, though still retaining their individuality. Roronoa Zoro, a green-haired 3-sword-wielding (one in each hand, one in his mouth) bounty hunter who has come to be known as 'Pirate Hunter Zoro' (though the name was neither coined nor furthered by the man himself) joins the crew in order to realise his childhood dream of becoming the best swordsman in the world, figuring the Grand Line should bring him a plethora of worthy opponents. Nami, the navigator, is a beautiful yet intelligent orange-haired girl whose dream is to draw a map of the whole world - though her main passion is accumulating vast sums of money, usually via theft. She is generally the brains of the crew, but occasionally needs Luffy to show her that her heart is in the right place. Usopp, a long-nosed man whose penchant for stretching the truth is made evident in pretty much every episode, wishes to follow in his father's footsteps and become a great pirate. Although he's not as strong as other members of the crew and has no specific 'special powers', his quick-thinking and ingenious-yet-comedic inventions have too often been known to save the day. Sanji, self-professed 'Love Cook', is a talented chef from the floating restaurant Baratie, who can cook as well as he can kick - Sanji is generally characterised by his inability to resist stepping in to rescue a beautiful lady, especially Nami (even though she manipulates him simply because she knows she can). Sanji joined the crew after great persuasion in order to find All Blue, the legendary ocean where the four seas meet, and thus fish from all the seas can be found - a gourmet cook's paradise. Tony Tony Chopper is the ship's doctor. Here's where it starts getting a little, well, let's say idiosyncratic. Chopper is a reindeer (not a tanuki, a reindeer!) who ate the 'Hito Hito' Devil's Fruit (hito means 'man'), meaning that he is not only able to talk (to both humans and animals - a skill that comes in very useful), but also walk on his hind legs, and even transform himself from cute to somewhat monstrous forms. Chopper wants to become a great doctor and help people, and eventually, after much persuasion from Luffy, sees piracy as a way to give his wish meaning and direction. An ongoing joke with Chopper is for him to shout &quot;Doctor! We need a doctor!&quot; whenever anybody gets injured, before realising that he's the ship's doctor, and so gets to work. Chopper is a cutesy/comedy character but also gives us plenty of reasons to take him seriously. Finally we have Nico Robin, a woman with a mysterious past, and another with the power of a Devil's Fruit. Robin ate the 'Hana Hana' fruit (hana = 'flower'), and thus is able to grow hands from any surface - an ability which sounds pointless on paper but has saved the Mugiwaras from so much danger over the episodes that it has become almost integral to their survival. Robin is an archaeologist who joined the Mugiwaras at her own behest, as Luffy had saved her life against her will. She spends most of her time reading history books, and someday dreams of finding the 'one true history' of their world by traversing the Grand Line in search of 'lodestones', which have ancient documents inscribed on them. Even at the early stage of introducing Luffy and watching him recruit the first few crewmates, I had fallen in love with this anime series. The first 20 or so episodes are somewhat slow-paced, as well as a little confusing, as the quirky sense of humour that One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda gives the series takes a little getting used to for a gaijin. The other members of the crew don't want to join Luffy's outfit immediately, but Luffy manages to convince them that becoming a pirate with him is the best way to realise their dreams, and also helps them to tie up loose ends in their homeland before setting off under the straw hat-wearing Jolly Roger. It's important to bear in mind that these are not your classic Western, rum-toting, eye patch-wearing, &quot;YAAAAAARRRRR&quot;-shouting pirates, with huge beards, peg legs and hooks for hands. That isn't to say there aren't characters who fall under these categories (except for the &quot;YAAAAARRRR&quot;ing), but One Piece is a world filled with intensely interesting, larger-than-life characters who bring a dimension to the anime you wouldn't have thought possible. The powers of the various enemies of the Mugiwara crew bring an almost rock-paper-scissors element to the show, as the party is often split up into groups who have to survive and meet back up with the others in order to continue their journey, some characters' expertises being more useful against certain enemies than others - although the rubberman never knows when to accept defeat! This anime contains some of the most imaginative and out-of-this-world story arcs I've ever come across in an anime series, especially one that does not take itself too seriously. One arc sees the Mugiwaras sail up into the sky to 'Skypeia', or Sky Island, where they take on an evil God who has the power of lightning. The final 'showdown' battles can span 10 or more episodes and are, for want of a better word, epic. Simply the journey undertaken to get onto the Grand Line itself is a tale worth rewatching for its many highlights, as well as being an introduction that comforts you by subtly indicating that the future escapades of the Mugiwara crew will pique your interests further. The Mugiwaras are to a point misunderstood as pirates - they don't plunder, rape or murder everybody they meet. In most cases, they actually help those they come across, but are still very much wanted by the Marines (the main governing body of the sea), who set huge bounties for Luffy and Zoro in order to garner help from bounty hunters, as well as the many other pirate factions sailing around. The animation sometimes lets the show down slightly - it seems the budget for the animators seems to rise and fall depending on the importance of the arc. Some battles are brilliantly animated, such as the showdown between Luffy and Crocodile, leader of the Shichibukai, but many of the filler arcs look poor in comparison. However, this does not take anything away from the fact that One Piece is a masterpiece, with a quirky Japanese sense of humour and a narrative that can be appreciated by all, but loved only by some. My advice is to give it a try - if you're anything like me it will certainly captivate your interest, and then some. Quick warning: stay WELL away from the 4KIDS English dub. They gutted the show, stripping it of many of its best features, and hired a voice cast that could test the sanity of anybody, be you 3 or 43. The lush orchestral musical score and lively J-pop intro has been replaced by awful faux hip-hop in order to market it to Americans, some of the blood is cut while some remains (this is NOT a gory anime by any stretch of the imagination - blood is used as more of an indicator that a fight has been going on a while), characters are renamed according to whim (Zoro is renamed Zolo, either to escape copyright infringement, give a closer transliteration from katakana, or just as an effort to be utterly, utterly lame), and there are some frankly ridiculous amendments - the one that really sticks out for me is Sanji's cigarette. Sanji likes to smoke, and he always has a cigarette hanging from the side of his mouth. In the 4KIDS dub, this cigarette is replaced - in every frame - with a lollipop.

"I haven't written a review in almost a year so i might as well start with this 80% of all user made reviews will be positive no matter what. The best way to evaluate anything is to read the negative reviews as well. This is a good rule to go by for anything (games, movies, appliances, etc) With that being said I'm not giving this series a 10. Quick Review: - Story (4/10) Its an infinite loop story, shounen boy being the greatest in the world and it follows him in all his wacky adventures. - Art (6/10) It is indeed a very well animated series but you can easily see many common ways to for the studio to cut corners. - Sound (8/10) Voice acting is top notch, everyone has a wide range of emotions but some overreact too much in one episode. Whats with all the yelling? - Characters (7/10) You'll either love em or hate them (or both) Regardless you''ll have your share of favorites and luckily you will know all about them. - Enjoyment (8/10) Main story arcs are great but what grinds it to a halt are the long drawn out situations in the vein of the Dragon Ball series. Full Review: I kept getting bugged and bugged about when i was going to pick this show up. Ever since 2004. Fast forward to 2008 and I finally picked up and started watching this show from episode 1. I started watching this show with very limited expectations since everyone keeps hyping the hell out of this show. And to be honest, the best way to watch this show is to have very low expectations. Because as soon as the story arc for obtaining Nami started (eps 031- 044), I definitely fell in love with this series. That story ark had everything a shounen anime should have, comedy, drama, action, and serious business. Basically an edge of your seat roller coaster ride trying to figure out what will happen next. Sadly, the story arc's like this are far and few between. The structuring of most arc's usually focus on one or two of the main characters which is perfect for a long running series like this. Don't get me wrong, alot of the adventures are good clean fun which most will enjoy. It's fine if there's no continuity what so ever and plot holes you can fill a 10 gallon trash bag in. It's all about over the top slapstick adventures and it does that well, even perfectly. So why in the hell did I give the story a score of 4? I could make a 10 page essay if I listed them all but the main issue is its whole premise. It is a LONG RUNNING shounen anime. That means they will do anything and everything to make a story arc as long as possible. A perfect example is that the opening AND closing credits will average between 90 to 150 seconds each, a last episode recap will last around 5 minutes , and a next week preview will last for about a minute. Add all that up and that roughly adds up to ~15 minutes of non essential story telling. FIFTEEN MINUTES!! Granted, new story arcs wont have as much time shaved off to start but the typical formula will repeat itself every time. But even then its like why bother watching last weeks episode if you can almost tell half of last weeks story today? Its an infinite loop that we're doomed to be in. Since they are a long drawn out stories, they also suffer from the Dragon Ball virus. Having a face off between good guys and bad guys for 30+ episodes and essentially 'filling' in the time with flashbacks or side stories really insults the viewers intelligence in my opinion. They even have the gall to replay back story arcs that lasted upwards to 10 episodes and 'rehash' the arc into one or half an episode. I could have easily skipped over 260 episodes if i knew they were going to do that. I know it is to acclimate new young viewers to how their lovable characters came to be, but isnt that what dvd's are for? Or at the very least, don't bother to tie them in to a story arc. One more thing I must mention, try not to think too hard when people look like they're going to die one minute and the next, they're up and jumping around like nothing happens or any inconsistencies like that. It will make your head explode if you do. If you are willing to forgive the aforementioned problems with this show (or any long running shounen anime) I'm sure you will notice they do carve alot of nice stories that you will more than likely enjoy. As the actual stories told in the series just look so much fun. It's like watching Indiana Jones NONSTOP. Although it will take forever for them to tell you a story, you'll either be laughing crying or enjoying the wackiness that is One Piece. The creator did do a wonderful job of making VERY unique and non static characters, although some might appear typical or cookie cutter, they usually do something completely opposite or you will discover things you never thought would happen (inconsistencies aside). On top of that, the voice actors are very memorable and fit their characters awfully well. Although most of them yell more than i would like, the sheer number of cast members is staggering and is hard for me not to be impressed. I agree I am not a fan of a few of the main characters but knowing so much about them (due to side stories) its hard not to cheer for the straw hat crew! This series is far from perfect, but it is very enjoyable. 6.6",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 15, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b37994aa26,1,5232
"Ask any person on the internet what their favourite kind of warrior is and you are bound to get one of these 2 answers. Ninja or Pirate. Now we ALL know Ninja\'s are a plenty in anime. But Pirates? Try finding a anime about that! Eiichiro Oda to the rescue! The legendary Pirate Gol D Roger. Once acquired everything a pirate could. But before he was executed he told people he hid his treasure \&quot;One Piece\&quot; at the end of the Grand Line. This started the great age of pirates! One Piece is set in the time of pirates. Even though there are references to real pirates. Bellamy, Alvida etc, its more of a fantasy world. And what a fantasy world it is! Weird creatures, giant monsters and people with a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; ability. Devil Fruit grants the person who eat it unique abilities such as transforming their body, or giving them special skills. The one consequence is it takes away their ability to swim. One of the people who ate a \&quot;Devil Fruit\&quot; Is the young man Luffy. Blessed with the Gomu Gomu fruit (Rubber) He is a rubber man. and he wants to be the \&quot;Pirate King\&quot; (The person who acquires \&quot;One Piece\&quot;) He and his crew of weird but unique characters set of to the \&quot;Grand Line\&quot; to find One Piece. Eiichiro Oda created some really amazing characters! Rorona Zoro a swordsman who uses 3 swords. Liar Usopp, Navigator and Money maniac Nami, Chef and Love freak Sanji, Reindeer misfit Chopper and more. Even though the characters seem a little bland at first after a few episodes their characters really start to shine. Humour is a really big part of the series. You will constantly laugh your ass off at the weird and just downright funny humour this series has to offer. But its not all comedy. Heck no! Fans of action and drama will also love this series. the fights are simply incredible! with the Devil fruit users being the highlights of the series. But just like that the series can take a much darker turn. And will certainly manage to bring a tear to your eye. (Nami\'s background being one of those times DAMN YOU ARLONG!) But it never turns into a emo fest. Its a pretty long series (counting over 310 episodes) and even though there are some filler arcs. It just keeps getting better and better.",10,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_41830ee10d,1,2278
"Well my first review, Ill try and make it a good one. One Piece, well i gotta be honest, I didn't like it at first. I thought that the voices were stupid and that it had really no plot whatsoever. This is all thanks to 4kids making the crappiest dub ever. I stopped watching it after, ep 20 or so, but then i heard to try it again using subs. I thought nah, it might sounds really stupid, but i still tried. After episode 20 or so, I was like &quot;WOW&quot;, this is awesome and from then on i was watching it non stop until episode 280 where i caught up. (yea i watched about 250+ episodes non stop) :D If you plan on watching it, watch it subbed please. Well that's enough of that. Onwards. Story The story is really amazing. At first i didn't find anything entertaining, but I pressed on and continued watching. The plot is really amazing. Its different from what most mangaka does, and that is power. The story is all about achieving your dreams, getting nakama(companions/friends), and overall having a grand adventure. The story is original in a sense that it gives you a feeling of ease and hilarity when reading it. I for one, have always enjoyed a chapter and in each chapter is very powerful and/or funny. Art Well to be honest, I find the art interesting. I mean its cool at times but then in some episodes its really crappy. Thats probably the only thing I dont like. But the fight scenes are amazing. The character design is very interesting and very original. The animation is pretty...crappy at times but that's to be expected in some animes. I mean not all of them would be amazing but there are quite a few that really have good animation. The animation for most fight scenes are really well drawn and intricate. Sound I have only one thought for this. JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS OWN AMERICAN VOICE ACTORS. Seriously, they sound so much better and once you hear them, your instantly hooked to them. 4kids really did the crappiest dubbing ever, and that was mainly why i stopped watching it. Also their gum gum rap( american opening) was so terrible. Thanks to Funimation for at least making an &quot;ok&quot; dub. But subs are still the best. Their voices mesh with the characters personality so much that it's amazing. Character Wow. The characters are really amazing. From the air-head captain to the greedy, money-loving navigator, it really is the most unique anime ever. They are all different characters with all different dreams that power them throughout the show. They all have alot in common, but really the biggest thing they have in common is that they all believe and support their captain, because he has saved them where they needed it the most. Every character in One Piece is different from everyone and they are all entertaining. Every episode is funny and most of the time it is Luffy that makes it funny. Luffy is pretty much the most unique character made. He is a simple minded captain who has no other thought other than one piece, his nakama, and MEAT. Yes meat, he loves meat, but if you watch it you will learn that :p Enjoyment Well, I thoroughly enjoyed it. The fillers are much better than Naruto or Bleach fillers and they are alot more exciting. Again the fight scences are amazing. Every episode you will definitely laugh, because Oda-sensei (the mangaka- the one who made One Piece) is awesome. He is pretty much the most creative mangaka, and the person i definitely want to meet. Overall Overall, I give One Piece a 10/10, well because it is pretty much amazing. The characters are very loveable, especially Luffy. Every episode i laughed, every episode I was always at the edge of my seat. If people tell you that One Piece sucks or that its not all that great, then don't listen! The only bad thing about One Piece is that 4kids made the dub first and then ruined it in America, don't listen and just watch it. Listen to me and not them okay :D",10,Recommended,"Nov 9, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5cb0884ed5,1,3894
"One Piece has been running for 15 years now and shows zero signs of slowing down. It is true that there are several anime and manga series that have run for MUCH longer, but that doesn't honestly excuse One Piece for how long it has overstayed it's welcome! One Piece has a diehard fandom and it is by far the highest in average rating out of the big 4 shonens. However, it is actually my LEAST favorite of the big 4. I'm dead serious, I really don't like One Piece and I will explain why. One Piece reminds me of a line from one of my favorite movies: Shaun of the Dead. Shaun: ""I like having him around, I've known him since primary school, and besides he's a laugh! Pete: ""Ok, I admit on rare occasion he can be funny. Remember when he was up all night drunk playing Tekken 2?"" Shaun: ""Oh yeah (laughs) when was that?"" Pete: ""That was 10 years ago! When the FUCK is he going home!?"" While other shonen series at least try to mature along with their fanbase like Naruto going to Naruto Shipuuden or Dragonball going to DBZ, One Piece is the same goofy, juvenile crap that it was in 1999, right down to the eye raping HORRIBLE art. Another problem is that it tells a continuous story, which makes it difficult for new fans to get into it or get caught up without spending 5 straight months doing nothing but watching One Piece! Pokemon has an excuse for running forever and never evolving (get it?) because new games come out and each season Ash must move to a new region and catch more Pokemon. Most people don't continue to watch Pokemon, so it is constantly getting new fans that are experiencing Pokemon for the first time. Pokemon (insert edition here) is their first Pokemon game and the anime seems fresh and new to them. They haven't seen the original Pokemon series or played the original games and it doesn't matter! Detective Conan has been running for 20 years, but like the Sherlock Holmes short stories it took inspiration from, it is completely episodic with a new mystery each week and only a few established characters. A new audience can jump in anytime and it doesn't matter if you've seen the first 15 seasons. One Piece actually tries to tell a continuous story where it DOES matter what happened in the first 10 seasons. You can't just jump in at episode 600 and expect to really enjoy it and understand it. However, even you get all caught up with the 800 episodes of the Straw Hat Crew, it isn't worth it because the tone, characters, and quality of story telling never matures into anything that someone 16 and up and having half a brain would find amusing! All of this isn't to say that One Piece is a particularly bad anime. I have seen some REALLY bad anime, but One Piece isn't on my list of anime I actually hate. One Piece is an anime that I consider mediocre, insanely overrated, and having run WAY past its time without having the grace or decency to take a bow. It is much like the Simpsons in that last regard. At least one good thing came out of One Piece....None Piece! If you haven't seen One Piece yet, I would recommend skipping this one, but still check out None Piece on Youtube, because it's awesome!",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 4, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a27d78d2fa,1,3144
"Ah, One Piece. The anime adaptation of the best selling manga in the world. I used to like this show when I first started watching it, but sadly I don't feel the same way about it anymore. So One Piece is a battle shounen anime, which follows the adventures of one Monkey D. Luffy, who aspires to be the King of the Pirates. He is the captain of the Strawhat Pirates, a crew consisting of both men and women, who all play an important role that helps keep the crew going, and they all have their own goals. Luffy is our typical, dumb shounen hero, who is a glutton, grins a lot, and is happy-go-lucky. He is a rubber man, whom can stretch parts of his body, gaining this ability after eating one of these ""Devil Fruits"" when he was younger. The rest of the Strawhat Pirates all have unique personalities, with their own quirks, and you're likely to find a favourite among them. Although, some of them can be annoying sometimes. The art style is something you'll either love or hate. It can be either appealing or unappealing to look at. In my case, I don't have a problem with it, and that there are worse-looking anime than One Piece. It's quite cartoony, and has a distinctive look to it. It's certainly a colourful anime throughout the series, with the exception of Thriller Bark, which is like a halloween-themed arc with dark colours being used instead of the usual bright and vibrant. The designs of the Strawhat Pirates look fine, both pre-timeskip and post-timeskip, but I do prefer Nami's sexier look she gets after the time-skip. But the show also has some of the ugliest-looking supporting characters you will find in an anime. The animation is ass. Not gonna lie. Produced by the infamous Toei Animation, the animation is average and just looks outdated compared to other long-running anime that aired (or is airing) around the same time. It's just disappointing and I know it could look better if another studio had done it, or if Toei put more budget into it like in the films. Along with this, the fights (which are mindless) just look unimpressive and are dull compared to the fights in other battle shounen anime like Naruto and Bleach, and it also uses a lot of still frames. There are also no fluid animation for the most important fights that happen in each arc. It's just the same average animation they use for every episode. They never treat the viewers with flashy animation. Not even in the climax of an arc. Barely any of the fights are memorable, they don't have strategy, and the choreography for the fights just suck. I've never been impressed with a single fight in One Piece. So the only things you can really look forward to are some plot twists. The sound effects are somewhat annoying. I personally hate the sound effect of a heart beating. It sounds gross and it doesn't sound anything like a heartbeat. The music is a mixed bag. It's upbeat most of the times, which goes well with the theme of the show. The first opening sounds amazing, and still is the best opening out of all the openings the show has had, but other openings, like the second one, are just painful to listen to. The main characters have their own theme music, which I always liked the idea of in anime in general, and they fit with the characters. The pacing is fine from episodes 2 to 301 (episode 1 was slow-paced), but it becomes permanently slow-paced starting from episode 302. Most of the filler episodes are surprisingly decent. Though in latter episodes, there are almost no filler episodes to speak of, which results in snail-pacing for the canon episodes. I think the anime should've taken a break for a year or two at that point so the manga chapters could pile up, or they could've made more filler arcs so the canon episodes would have better pacing. There are some things that have always annoyed me while watching this show, other than the fights. There is a lot of crying in it, from both main and supporting characters. Not only that, but they make these ugly, exaggerated expressions on their faces when they cry. It's probably a staple of the show, but it feels like they went way overboard with the tears, and it got irritating the more I watched the show and hear them wailing. They cry so easily. Accompanying this is the constant melodrama. Hate that shit. It tries too hard to make the viewers cry. The characters tend to overreact to danger in an anime where nobody dies in it. Yes. There are a lack of deaths in this anime. Basically, for the most part, nobody dies in this show (outside of flashbacks). Like nobody. In an action show about pirates, where characters have been put into situations which would've resulted in certain death time and time again. This got noticeable the more I watched it, and this may be my biggest gripe with this series. It just feels strange that a show like this to not have any deaths for hundreds of episodes. Like I wasn't expecting any characters to die within the first 100 episodes or anything, but the lack of deaths started bothering me after a while. I also didn't expect any of the main characters to kill people or die themselves (because of plot armour which is reasonable since they are main characters). Although, I remember a moment when Zoro attacked with intention to kill these two bad guys, and was surprised that they lived? Like wtf? He was actually trying to kill them? Okay, so Roronoa Zoro is also known as Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro, which means he has killed people before. But after he debuts, we never see him kill anyone, but he's the only person in Luffy's crew who we know that has killed people before. But damn, does it take a long-ass time for the first actual death to take place in the show. For the first 400 episodes, all the tragic moments are in flashbacks or end up being fake-outs if it's in present time. I don't mind lack of deaths in an action anime that has a realistic setting (Shijou Saikyou no Deshi Kenichi, for example, which is more focused on martial arts and delinquents as the bad guys, so you're not expecting anyone to really die in a show like that as there's no intent to kill). But One Piece has a fantasy setting and the villains have intent to kill. And honestly it's unacceptable to me for an action/fantasy anime like this have virtually no deaths. Where's the tension? And it's a shame because there are characters in this show who are irredeemable pieces of shit that need to die, but you know they won't, and that will leave a lot of us unsatisfied. What also irks me are the moments where the show makes it look like somebody has died, but later on you find out that they didn't. In fact, there's a moment in an episode where this specific supporting character should've died because what he was doing meant that he had zero chance of surviving, yet he lived. He was no longer relevant in the story after that moment, so why not kill him off? It is one of the most bullshit moments I've ever seen in an anime, it ruined their sacrifice, and it made the character less memorable and less heroic. The show has more fake-out deaths than actual deaths. After realising how rare deaths are in this show, I just roll my eyes whenever a character, in a non-flashback scene, says that they're going to kill or decapitate another character. We never have to worry about any character because they're just going to be fine in the end every single time. And speaking of flashbacks, why do most of the characters have to have overly tragic backstories? I get it! They had it rough! Stop making me feel sorry for everyone! Another thing is that the villains aren't really memorable. Dragon Ball Z has Frieza, Cell, and Majin Buu, and they're more memorable than any villain in One Piece. The villains in One Piece tend to have they're own unique laughs too, but it just sounds silly. I also think that shows like Hunter x Hunter and Yu Yu Hakusho has more interesting villains than One Piece. I also don't really like the humour; it's just childish and involves slapstick and retorting. Things like Zoro getting lost all the time as a running gag. In other words, it's mostly unfunny, at least to me. Humour is subjective after all. And I just don't like the general tone of the series. You often see these minor, nameless characters commentating by screaming their lines to whatever is going on in front of them in a silly way in dramatic moments, and it's pretty annoying. Would've been better if it didn't have that at all. And the anime in general is a bit too goofy at times compared to other battle shounens, even if it is a comedy. I think Fairy Tail does it better when it comes to comedy in a battle shounen. Overall, the main characters are the strongest aspect of One Piece, and is the biggest reason why I try to continue to watch the anime. I admit it's fun to see the Strawhat crew's adventures. It's a pretty silly show, not taking itself seriously at all. I guess people like the show for the worldbuilding too. However, the abundance of melodrama might be a turn-off for some people. The arcs are also formulaic for the most part, so it gets repetitive too. There's 2 retrieval arcs too, meaning Oda recycled something he already did in the story when he decided to do a second retrieval arc. There shouldn't be more than 1 retrieval arc, even if it is a different character they're trying to retrieve! And even if One Piece seems to be largely its own thing with its own original characters, Oda still decided to have a character called Blackbeard (or Marshall D. Teach) in it, and it's obviously based on the real life pirate Blackbeard (real name being Edward Teach), and I am disappointed with Oda for doing that instead of making all the characters fictional. I also think the character Bellamy is based on the real-life pirate Samuel Bellamy, and Kuma Bartholomew is based on the real-life pirate Bartholomew Roberts. Well, if you have a lot of time on your hands, and like adventure, then consider checking this show out. But if you're looking for a battle shounen with spectacular fights, then I suggest you look elsewhere. The fights in One Piece are crap. Don't listen to anyone that says that the fights in One Piece are ""epic"" or ""fun"" or ""cool as fuck"" because the fights are the complete opposite of those things. They probably never watched Dragon Ball Z or Naruto or Yu Yu Hakusho or newer shows like Jujutsu Kaisen where the fights in those anime are actually good and will give you goosebumps. If someone thinks One Piece fights are better than Naruto's or Jujutsu Kaisen's, then they are a blind fanboy or they must be joking or not being serious. Because I cannot understand how anyone would prefer One Piece's shitty fights over Naruto's jaw-dropping fights. One Piece doesn't have 1 single fight that is good. So I myself grew tired of watching One Piece after the Thriller Bark saga. The show peaks in the Marineford arc, and there's little reason to continue watching this show after the timeskip. In fact, the first arc after the timeskip is one of the worst and most boring arcs I've ever seen, and I just wanted that arc to end as soon as possible. Honestly, I think the early episodes of One Piece, the East Blue Saga, are the best episodes.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 16, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_892c1fe630,1,11207
"The pinnacle of mind-numbing tedium, One Piece proves that just because something is popular doesn't necessarily mean it's good. It's issues are many and numerous, eliminating any chance it had at being the greatest anime of all time. 1. The Pacing: There isn't a single arc that isn't outrageously long. From drawn-out fights to lengthy (and usually dumb) filler scenes, I'd say about 70% of each arc is a waste of time and doesn't need to be there. The longest arc (Wano) is close to 200 episodes, and yes, they spend the entire arc fighting the same guy. 2. Length: It's not just that the show is drawn out, it would still be unbelievably long even if it the arcs weren't stretched to their limit. The anime has been running for over 25 years and the manga will soon reach it's 30th anniversary in 2027. 3. It doesn't have a clear demographic: Sometimes One Piece boasts idiotically cringe-worthy humor that only a child would find funny, but with dark moments, outrageous oversexualization of female characters, and blood, it's clearly not for young kids. But the series is so childish overall that it cannot be considered a show meant for teens. 4. Irritating Characters: All of the characters are either dumb or loud. I don't think there's a single episode that doesn't contain idiotic yelling. Luffy is so stupid and clueless that it's impossible to like him. Would I recommend this? No. Never.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 17, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8fe41ba85c,1,1401
"REVIEW OF ONE OF THE BEST ANIMES (IF NOT THE BEST) EVER !!! //ONE PIECE\\ AFTER 982 EPISODES 2021 - INCLUDED- First of all, let's get rid of the most stupid reason that someone says before starting watching One Piece. Not watching because of too many episodes. If you want to watch anime and your only goal is to FINISH it then this anime is not for you. One Piece is made to enjoy its story, not to finish it ASAP. When you start watching it, you will get in love with the story, characters and then you will just go and watch it without stopping. After catching it up you would like there to be more and more episodes and you will never regret watching all 900 episodes. You don't have to finish it in like 5 months, take your time and seat and just watch when you feel like it and how much you want. As more as you are watching, you will get the point of the anime and it will be more and more interesting and enjoyable. As regards the art style, I would like to say that art style is unique, and if you don't like it at first you will get used to it and you will see that it will just make anime better. Every anime has its own art style and that's good that they are different, imagine every anime using the same art style it would be boring. As more as you are watching it, you will just forget about it and will be a normal thing, later with a clean and fresh look will show you the story in a beautiful way! The beginning of One Piece is very interesting. Introducing characters and story is well done. While you are watching you will get easily in love with every member of the crew and also through the story you will learn their past and you will get mindblowed. Every character has its own personality and background that is very well made and perfectly connected with the whole story and is important. One Piece has arcs, in every arc, there will be introduced new characters and every arc has tension and uncertainty. You will just wonder what will happen next and get excited. You will hype every episode and you can't wait for the next one. The feeling that you will be getting through the story and episodes will just overcome you in every way and you are going to feel so good while watching One Piece and while passing through the story with Luffy! Everything that is happening to the characters you will feel in your way and will just get connected to them like that they are someone who is important in your life and who mean a lot to you. They will become your friends and you are going to go with them on unforgettable adventures with a very interesting and unique plot and events. I can't describe how much this MASTERPIECE IS GOOD, words are not enough, you must see it yourself and will thank me later! !!! JUST REMEMBER - ONE PIECE STORY IS UNMATCHED WITH ANY OTHER ANIME !!! !!! One Piece has such a deep story that I haven't seen in any other anime. The whole story is done without mistake, all fights include epic moments that you will enjoy and hype, all EMOTIONAL and UNFORGETTABLE, EXTRAORDINARY moments will pierce through your heart and will stay there forever sealed, also will be giving you goosebumps. !!! Another reason why people won't start watching one piece is because of animation. - First of all, you cant expect old anime(from 1999) to have a good animation at the start. - Anime of 1000 episodes cant have constantly good animation, although the animation DOES get better and better every arc, and currently ONE PIECE has one of the best animations I have EVER seen in my ENTIRE life and I am pretty sure that it will get even better without exaggeration. Even If One Piece doesn't have that good animation at the start and pacing later on in the anime due to anime catching up to the manga, TRUST ME, it doesn't matter. The story, world-building, characters are almost PERFECT that you will not even bother with animation and pacing. !!! If you don't want to begin this beautiful adventure because of some people saying that it's too long or that animation is bad, then I am sorry for you, because you don't know what are you missing !!! Once you get into One Piece you will regret that you didn't start it earlier and you will see that these reasons are really stupid. !!! Overall, One Piece is one MASTERPIECE !!! GIVE IT A CHANCE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!! I hope you will enjoy this anime as I did! 10/10",10,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3fd7fbe581,1,4353
"I never write reviews but I think this series deserves it. NOTE: This is obviously not a bad-ass/cool-mysterious guy on a seemingly complex mission that is trying to mind-fuck you. This is SHOUNEN. Straight-forward and easy to understand for younger viewers and deep enough for the older. This is business as well as entertainment ei: MAINSTREAM. Sure it has a VERY generic shounen anime base-line but it has a lot more depth to it that only a mature audience can understand. This can't be seen within the first 20 episodes; it's one of those things where you have to grin and bare with. Most likely, your efforts would be worthwhile. I'll just follow the trend and comment on the sections; starting with the weakest qualities. 1. ART: (6/10) This is a HUGE issue and it takes a lot of perseverance and patience to get used to the art style of this anime. It took me about 6 months to get used to it. At first, everyone looked like overly-hyper, 12 year-olds being too loud and just looking at them made me want to stop. Noodle-like arms and legs, weird anatomy etc. the list goes on. But if you power through however long it takes for you to get used to the art, the characters appear as catalysts of nothing but pure emotion. This puts you in a weird, neutral position. You know that the art isn't great but you can't seem to imagine this series in any other way. Changing the art style becomes a bad idea. The only reason why I'm giving the art style a 6/10 is because it's so damn hard to swallow. In the end, anime isn't just eye-candy, it's storytelling first and foremost and I think One Piece knows this very well. 2. SOUND: (8/10) The sound in this series isn't bad but it isn't spectacular though it does have golden moments during heavily emotional scenes. What IS fantastic is the seiyuu's performances throughout this colossal series. They (generally) capture the essence of their characters, flaws and all. For example: The annoying idiot aspects of Luffy. Mayumi Tanaka was THE voice for Luffy. No one could fill her shoes. The opening themes usually sets the correct tone for the series; an up-beat, ""let's go on an adventure"" kind of feeling. Corny? Maybe, Childish? Very, Effective? Absolutely. For what One Piece is and what it does; the sounds in the series definitely supports. It's doesn't suit my taste in music but it's very ""One Piece"", which adds to the experience. 3. STORY: (10/10) The depth of this story will surprise anyone. I had very low expectations for this series, having started years after it began airing but after watching it for a while, I truly believe that this is one of the best shounen stories to date. Despite being from a very obvious shounen base-line, One Piece delivers fantastically. One Piece explores society in a very extreme manner; often exaggerated to enhance the hype of the moment. You can see that this is deliberate because of how everything within the story drives to one particular moment. I don't think One Piece's story should be compared to reality because it's simply not realistic: It's not supposed to be but we can certainly compare and relate the ideas and themes within the plot. This is a truly well thought-out plot, beautifully integrated with the characters to provide a very wholesome experience. If you sit there and watch it -searching for flaws- you will be missing the point of One Piece. If you approach it with a ""What the hell but whatever, lets see how this goes"" attitude, you are guaranteed to enjoy this plot more. NOTE: Fillers are NOT stories, they fill empty spaces. That's why they're called 'fillers'. They are meant to be half-assed to buy time for the author. You can't judge a series by fillers, that just means you're stupid. 4. CHARACTER: (10/10) First impressions are important when it comes to characters. Unfortunately, One Piece fails at this and fails pretty hard. We are introduced to a very typical hero, off to be some king of something and be the biggest, baddest man on town: in this case, the world. Then we meet a typical tough-guy/Mr. Cool. etc. The thing that is amazing about the characters in One Piece is that though they appear very standard; they somehow manage to break their cookie-cutter mold. Each character basically has one strong quality about them but that one aspect of their character is what makes each character special. They then develop as the story progresses; being faced with challenges each character's physical, mental and emotional state to their limits; tests their judgment and instincts. They are never perfect but it's how they work around their shortcomings and utilize their few strong aspects to survive in the hostile world of One Piece, that puts the characters of One Piece in a league of their own. Once you get used to the whole atmosphere of this series, you will find that you won't be able to help but feel very attached to almost every character you come across. 5. ENJOYMENT: (10/10) It's fabulous. I can't think of any other series with this much depth; in character design and the execution of the plot. There is a lot to read into in this series, people just need to take a deep breathe and allow themselves to be drowned and suffocated by it. It won't kill you I promise. 6. OVERALL: (10/10) I obviously love this series. It's completely underrated and is constantly being flamed by 'mature viewers' that think they've actually grown up just because they watch brain-raping anime with what SEEMS like a complicated plot when it's actually just another generic anime to their related genre. This series deserves a lot more than that. It is worth the trouble of getting used to the painful art style. It is worth credit. There IS a reason why it's popular. We, in the Western world tend to think that it's mind-boggling to see that THIS is one of their most popular animes but I think it's our arrogance and denial that is causing this negative reaction. Apparently, anime is just pretty colors, characters with big eyes and crazy hair, and big tits or a scifi-novel with moving pictures. One Piece is a fantastic combination of business, entertainment and art. It's obvious why this series is such a success in it's homeland. It's just tragic how a disgrace to mankind (4Kids Entertainment) got hold of this gem before it could reach a wider audience. This is not a masterpiece; but it's pretty damn close to being one. There is no such thing as a perfect show.",10,Recommended,"Jul 3, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a7f099d3bd,1,6419
"Yes, you can believe your eyes, I really rated One Piece a 6. But please! Wait before spamming the 'Not Helpful' Button. I'm myself a fan of Shonen Anime, so I should happen to like One Piece, right? Right?! Nope, not really. But let's delve a bit deeper. Story: 6/10 The definitely most promising about One Piece is its absolutely unique setting. The sheer vastness of the world makes this anime outstanding. And even better, in that kind of setting nearly everything can happen. Adventures on the ship, tropical islands, deserts, or some snowy winter paradise. However, despite this promising world, each and every damn arc is exactly the same, over and over again!! Our crew gets to island XYZ. Some evil enemy appears and beats up everyone. I mean, look how scary this boss is (more to said boss in character by the way). After being beaten up however, the Nakama get a powerup, and defeat the boss. Repeat. And again. Aaand again. Art: 6/10 I won't mention something about the unique Art-Style. Everyone has read up on that one already. Some might like the cartoonisch, and also childish, artworks. I don't BUT I wouldn't cut 4 points for such a reason. So what about those 4 points? Battleanimations. This single word is enough. One Piece has one of the lousiest animations in terms of battle of all time. Repeating scenes, classic cut scenes, everything. Just in the last fight I watched Zoro had a fight, where he parried an attack with his three swords. They change the camera angle, and suddenly Zoro holds only two of his three swords, with the last one being in his Saya. And the sad thing is, this isn't every once in the while, those mistakes are common occurences. Sound: 8/10 First of all, the OST/Backgroundmusic. Even though some OSTs were misplaced, the most of the OSTs are pretty good and fit the desired atmosphere. Second, the Voice acting: I won't hide the fact, that I like Zoros seiyu Nakai Kazuya. Ever since his first appearence in Gintama, he has been one of my favorites. The other voice actors did their share of work as well, I especially like Luffys, Namis and Choppers voices. Last, but not least, the opening and ending section: I'll start with this. Later on, the openings get far too long with 2:30 each. Stick to the common 1:30 damnit! Well, whatever. Most of the openings and endings blend in really well with the overall tune of the show. I don't really like the openings and endings, but they fit, which is the most important point. Character: 7/10 Can't really say, that I really like any of the characters (besides Zoro and Nami, but thats just personal oppinion) but they have their reasons of existence. Way worse than the main crew are the completely forgettable enemies. They have puny reasons for being evil, are completely incompetent, and worst of all, some of them even turn face (wrestlingterm: becoming one of the good guys) after being defeated. Enjoyment: 5/10 What can I say? Some of the jokes were okay, but serious matters are painfully dump to watch, because the series is just completely unable to stay serious. Also, for a battleshonen, the battles are awfully bad. Well, at least I'm able to crack a wry smile. Every once in a while that is. Overall: 6/10 Many think of One Piece as one of the Big Three Battle Shonen, together with Naruto and Bleach. Since I haven't seen Bleach yet, I won't compare those two, but there is no problem with comparing it to Naruto, right? Overall, Naruto wins by a large margin. Its battles are better, the soundtrack is better, the art is more detailed, the series can stay more serious, and whats most important to me: The whole skill system is more complex, but also way superior to One Pieces Devils Fruits etc. An example as ending? Okay: Why for example do Devils Fruits Users not loose their powers in rain? Due to Oda because its moving water. But at the same time they loose their powers in rivers. And strictly speaking: Oceans are moving waters as well. The only unmoving water I can think of are swamps. If you got questions or feedback, its highly appreciated.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 18, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_79ae265ef8,1,4069
"One Piece is honestly the most amazing series I have ever watched or read. The plots are well-written and hold my attention without taking themselves too seriously and adding unnecessary drama that causes me to lose interest. The characters are some of the most endearing, well-developed and likable characters and the art, while not appealing to me at first, took a grand total of TWO episodes to get used to before I found it to be incredibly unique and my favorite anime art style to date. While this series has serious moments, it never stops being funny. Something important about the humor in this series is that it's ORIGINAL. None of the typical jokes that are recycled in every anime and even the serious moments I was talking about are sprinkled with clever and endearing humor that keeps me watching. Something that is important to me in a series is the characters. If I don't like characters, chances are, I'm not going to like the series. The lead cast to One Piece has won me over in their own individual ways. There is not a single one I don't like and I seriously thought that was IMPOSSIBLE. I could go on and on about this series but it's not my job to tell you EVERYTHING great about it! Just take my word on it!",10,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_596aa99944,1,1231
"''I'm Luffy! The Man Who Will Become The Pirate King'' This is the quote, that sets the main plotline for the series. Along with the name of the title itself. Hearing this and glimpsing at the synopsis, I build up expectations of an amazing journey, coupled with an engaging story driven narrative and good sense of mystery. Unfortunately those expectations were not met with great content to satisfy them. My main motivations for starting this was my desire to understand why is this series so successful in Japan. And I'm afraid to say after I gave the show a shot, I wasn't able to get it, or even see the appeal like I would for others shows that I didn't like. Let's start with the Characters [3/10]. They might be one of my biggest gripe of the show. I could forgive the semi-episodic narrative of the show and the repetition found in the format of the arcs if the characters kept my interest and made me want to keep watching. It's not that I simply didn't like them, because Luffy the protagonist himself is pretty likeable, and I like Zoro and Robin. But characterization, progression and just the general writing of the characters fails to deliver. Luffy is two dimensional at best. Everything about him feels borrowed from Goku, and not much is exclusive to him. He doesn't have any significant character development for more than 100+ episodes. He has the same track mind, same point of view. Never changing or maturing. Not feeling any more sense of responsibility and not gasping a bigger sense of the world, emphasizing his naivety and immature personality. So he is a static character for a big portion of the show. While static doesn't mean a bad character by default, in the case of Luffy it makes him a bad character. It makes him super predictable in how he reacts to things, his interactions with others and his decisions in general. There is hardly any fleshing out of his character outside of simple dialogue and simple motives ''I want to be the pirate king'' '' I Will Protect my Nakama'' ''I love meat''. His characterization is very simple and while that could be considered likeable, it's yet not charming as Goku. Since it's just a copy. I just find him dull and non-simulating, the shouting and care free personality with the serious personality in fights doesn't make him interesting to me. There is just no particular depth in his characterization or the execution of his character. He is faced with a major life changing events later on in the series, but he is still the same character after it passes. When speaking of development, it's not meant to be a complete change of personality (180 personality change) but it means a significant change in characterization, while his fundamental character is still intact. A dynamic character most often than not is more interesting with more room to show more layers of the character. The other main characters more or less are the same as Luffy just slightly better. I found Nami's character to be good due to her conflict with pirates and her character development and back story in Arlong park. I thought that was a not so average aspect like most other things, and I even started liking her. But as soon as that arc finished she remains static with nothing to offer, making her interactions with the crew members predictable, annoying and hardly funny. I expected to see more to her than simple gags. They don't get development past their introductory arcs. Which makes them less believable and interesting, considering they are on a big journey that should alter their lives forever. Repeating of their dreams and motives every other time kinda makes them shallow, because they offer nothing else in conflicts, internal struggles or different dimensions or something subtle to make me wonder and try to think and understand something deeper or anything interesting really. They remain in a status quo for a very long time. The author just doesn't try and bring fourth interesting conflicts for them to develop alongside the story. It's like after he is done with their basic and initial characterization he just stops there. So they feel like very incomplete characters that have unharvested potential despite the length of the series. I really dislike Sanji. He is the worst crew member. No. He is the worst character in the entire show. No. He is the worst character I've ever seen in any shounen anime. There is bad, and there is offensively bad. Sanji belongs to the latter. His characterization, I don't exactly get what the author wanted here. Did he really want him to be a celebration of sexism? it's supposed to be chivalry but it goes beyond that, and enters the realm of sexism with Sanji. When he refuses to fights female characters even if the lives of his crew members depends on it. He is not supposed to be a comic relief character, so this isn't an excuse to how his character is written and presented. I don't see him as a classy womanizer, I see him as an offensive character who's love for women shouldn't be more than a comedic side to him. It shouldn't be a big part of his characterization. It came to the point where his comedic nose bleed became an actual plot point, I shit you not. It's like everything about him aside form his initial dream (that is never brought up as an actual point of relevance after his arc) is about women. And that's why he is that much worse than the other characters in the show. There is nothing redeeming about him (even his style of fighting is bleh) The story [5/10]. I didn't see something particular impressive about it. There are certain problems that is apparent in almost every arc. They are formulaic for the most part. The crew goes from an island to an island helping the inhabitants of said islands, and go on about their way. It feels like every arc is episodic and discontinued, with little things barely connecting them together to an overarching story. I didn't like that since I like continuity and for a premise such as this, I was more in favor of non-episodic storytelling. As it feels like padding, since you get introduced to a lot of characters that are in the end not important or even relevant outside of their perspective arc for the story or the main characters. Once in a while one of those characters make a surprise appearance and the fans get excited, feels a bit like tricking them from my point of view, especially with the characters that are supposed to be dead but are never shown exactly their death. The type of stories in each of these arc is more or less fundamentally the same. An evil oppressor (Arlong, Crocodile) does his evil ways in the island and controls it for his own objectives. The heroes (strawhat crews) became friendly and bond with the villagers, so they are asked to help them. Luffy takes on the big bad and the others take care of the henchmen. This type of scenario gets boring pretty fast. Especially when it in itself, without the repetition is dreadful and the bare bones of a hero vs villain narrative. In Alabasta, it almost feels like a Disney story, with the person asking for help being a princess. Villains in the series in general are evilly cartoon-ish. Another issue is the plot armor, and how almost nobody dies. 700 episodes and the death of important characters can be counted in one hand. Nothing wrong with keeping it light, but if that's the the intention then the characters shouldn't be facing that many near death experience and surviving through cartoon logic. It will really test your suspension of disbelief. Luffy for whatever reason almost always has to take the big bad of any arc, which adds to the formulaic nature of the arcs. There no logic behind it aside from Luffy being the protagonist. This negates the potential for more interesting conflicts or the chance for other crew members to get a bigger spotlight. Zoro's spotlight in Thriller Part is a fine example of how Luffy not hogging the spotlight for once was incredibly refreshing and most importantly great on it's own. The pacing [2/10]. This in particular is one of the biggest issues in the series. That overwhelming amount of episodes isn't like that just because of the great mass of content alone, but the almost snail pacing contributes to that greatly. Toei is the animation studio in charge of this adaption. It became infamous for this type of pacing and production. Intro in the beginning of each episode, recaps, a lot of paused shots, and overall just the mind numbing feeling that nothing of interest is happening for several minutes of an episode. This is definitely the biggest hindrance of enjoyment in the show, at least for me. But it's not all Toei's fault. The original source material also has a slow progression of events. Along with Toei's treatment, this makes for an unsatisfying watching experience. Which is one of the main reasons if not the biggest reason why I dropped the series above all else. Take in mind, that this isn't to say slow pacing is inherently bad, it actually can enhance the experience of certain works. But One Piece is definitely not one of those works. A balance would have been ideal, even if I have preferences for fast pacing in action shows. It's currently according to a lot of people unbearable, so it only gets worse. The action component of the series is, in my opinion just awful [3/10]. I personally consider the fights in One Piece to be the worst I've seen in any action shounen I've watched. Be it in terms of creativity, strategy, abilities/powers, excitement or animation. The abilities/powers are silly, while that works with the general style of the show, its still lacks creativity, as they feel like they are created by a child. A rubber man. Someone that can make anything into a door. Feet that generate fire from the passion of the heart, etc. I will get to the animation in it's own paragraph. The fights are sometimes really dumb, and are mostly devoid of strategy. The best you can get in terms of strategy, is juvenile tricks by Ussopp, and the silly 'tactics' Luffy comes up with, that shouldn't work but they do because of Luck or/and the incompetence of the villains (the classic trite of you are beneath me so I didn't take you seriously and was careless) . Shouting and straight forward predictable fighting, is what you will get. The tension created by how is this character going to best this character is simply not there. When Zoro gets beaten up badly by someone made of steel, but suddenly has the resolve and wants to believe he can cut steel, and he just does with no good explanations, you will know that you shouldn't expected anything smart out of the fights. In fact some are offensively dumb, Bon clay vs Sanji comes to mind. There is also how the comedy is inserted in some fights or certain scenes. I realize that show has a lot of comedy, and it's a prominent genre, but that doesn't mean it should be inserted whatever. With disregard of the current tone and atmosphere of the scene, a particular scene in thriller park had that. It undermines the importance of the fights sometimes and the mood that is being set, and it in itself is rarely funny. The humor in general is not great. As it's very repetitive and most often dry. How many times until Nami, yelling at the crew and showing her greed becomes just plain unfunny. Though maybe if you really like any particular gag, you will still like seeing it again and again (Zoro's bad sense of direction for example). So it depends on the individual's sense of humor. It wasn't until Alabasta that I found an episode to have legitimately funny scenes, so I came across more misses than hits. The Art and Animation, and OST [5/10]. I will be frank, I didn't really take much notice to the soundtrack so I can't comment on it. The artstyle of the series is often described as ''ugly'' by those who refuse or avoid to watch it. And I can't say that I blame them. Is the art different compared to similar shows? Yes. Does that automatically makes it better or good? not necessarily. The art is influenced by western cartoons and Disney. And it's fair point for those that think it's works well with the series, and I agree to a certain extent. But that still doesn't mean me or others will like it, as it's still very unappealing. It also has an apparent effect on the emotional scenes in the show. The facial expressions are so exaggerated that it disengaged me from whatever emotional scene I was watching. With big rainy eyes, and noses full of snot. It completely lacks subtlety. Bigger doesn't always mean better. It comes off as the show trying hard to emphasize just how sad what you are watching is. It can be ineffective and worse, counterproductive, when instead of feeling sorry and emotionally involved you feel like laughing because of the ridiculous faces. While I understand this is a long running anime therefore expecting fluid animation is unfair. It still should mean that at least once in a while you will be presented with good to great animation in important scenes and fights. Like with other long running battle anime. This unfortunately is not the case here. At times it feels like a slideshow. Barely any nice visual effects. Lot of pauses and staring. Still shots. No good Sakuga. And it only gets worse currently according to the fans. The Worldbuilding [5/10]. I left this at the last, because from my general understanding this is the most praised thing about the show. But why? from my point of view, there is nothing impressive about a city in the dessert or an island in the clouds/sky. Once again the creativity of the author seems child like. But maybe that's the appeal. The feeling of freedom, and childish imaginative without the shackles of reality. But it still doesn't necessarily make it great. It feels like it's praised because he created a vast world that is still expanding because why wouldn't he expand it, when the estimation for the number of chapters is beyond 1000. But then again, worldbuilding wasn't something that I cared for in general, in my favorite shows, or any work of fiction for that matter. I could appreciate well done aesthetics of a beautiful world, that you like to take a mental picture of. That's not the case here, so I can't really credit it. Ultimately, I truly and honestly wanted to like this. So the gigantic amount of episodes/chapters would become an advantage. I wanted to be immersed in a story and keep following it for years. But the series failed me, after giving it a fair enough chance. I stomached through the beginning since they said Arlong park where it will get good. I endured after that, when they said Skypiea is fun and worth it. I couldn't keep on hoping, when they said it's Water 7 this time, more than 200 episodes. I just gave up. There wasn't any pay off. Everything was standard average to below average, with few exceptions. Not special or distinctive to dislike or for this to become more than a disappointment. My enjoyment being hindered with the pacing, and lack of stimulating characters, I made the natural choice of dropping it. I just couldn't take another minute felt like I will just die from boredom. TL:DR- If you are hesitant whether or not to make this big time commitment, you should keep in mind that it's generally agreed upon by fans and haters alike that it doesn't get better until Arlong park, which more than 30 episodes into the anime. I would recommend this, if you are looking for a happy go lucky battle shounen, that has a lot of focus on the adventure. I don't recommend this, if you are looking for a continuous narrative of a complex story about finding a treasure, with interesting unique characters. Nothing of value is lost, or something worth the commitment if you are avoiding this.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 24, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b15ebbbb85,1,15753
"You know what I really miss? The good ol' days of shonen anime/manga where something could have an outrageously bizarre concept with an equally bizarre universe which can be light in tone and set the stage for some grand adventures to unfold. Nowadays, it seems like most shonen anime and manga try to be all dark and edgy in order to defy those sort of preconceived notions that all shonen anime and manga is light-hearted and/or childish. While that's all fine and dandy, I can't help but feel that we're losing something special in the process of this sort of transition from light-hearted adventures to dark and grim tales of survival. With the cancellation of the Hunter x Hunter anime (further compounded by the manga's hiatus), it seems like brutal survival games chock full of fan service and outrageously violent battles are all that's left of shonen series. Then enters One Piece: one of the most popular shonen anime/manga series out there which is still going strong despite being around for 15-something years. It's had a lot of ups, downs, and more than its fair share of criticism levied against it but all things considered... it's something like a breath of fresh air in this stale climate that shonen anime/manga seems to have immersed itself in as of late. ***THE CONCEPT AND SETTING*** One Piece takes place in a world completely dominated by maritime travel that's currently experiencing something known as the ""Golden Age of Pirates."" The ""Golden Age"" was brought about by the death of the so-called Pirate King, Gold Roger and his final words about where he's put his entire life's fortune. Whosoever finds Gold Roger's treasure, the eponymous ""One Piece"" will then become king of the pirates (or so the legend goes; I question how finding a dead man's riches will automatically make you king of all maritime bandits, but that's beside the point). While many people might dismiss this concept as childish, this is one of the very things I love the most about One Piece. You want to know why? The reason why is that despite the simple set-up would seemingly get repetitive over a short span of time, Eiichiro Oda steps up to the plate and manages to deliver plenty of adventures that are so grand in scope that you'll have a hard time trying to keep your jaw attached to your face. The way that Oda manages to so is quite clever and something that I never really get tired of: the fact that the Grand Line (the place where the vast majority of One Piece takes place in) is pretty much a perfect canvas to unleash his creative mind. The Grand Line is literally a place where common sense won't get you anywhere. Conventional means of navigation are impossible because each island emits its own, strong magnetic field that interferes with regular compasses. Instead, you need a special compass called a ""log pose"" which basically leads you to the next island and that island is completely random. In addition to that, it takes a certain amount of time for the log pose to reset itself and lead you to the next island. The log pose can change at a moment's notice, so you can't even trust the calm of the seas or the weather. On that note, weather in the Grand Line is incredibly chaotic due to the irregular magnetic field that encompasses the entire area. On the topic of weather, every island in the Grand Line has its own climate, fauna, and such. Some islands are cloaked in perpetual winter while other islands are quite literally stuck in prehistoric times with dinosaurs and everything. Going back to the log pose, sometimes it can point you to seemingly impossible locations. Would you believe that there's an entire arc in One Piece that takes place on an island IN THE FUCKING SKY?!?! I'm not even kidding. Whenever Eiichiro Oda puts his mind to it, he really can surprise you with what he can come up with. In fact, when it comes down to the world-building, only Fullmetal Alchemist and Hunter x Hunter come close to matching it. Of course, One Piece and HxH opt for a sort of ""make it up as you go along"" approach while Fullmetal Alchemist is more carefully crafted. A rather important part of One Piece's universe is the existence of the so-called ""Devil Fruits."" Whosoever devours one of these strange fruits will be given great power at the expense of their ability to swim. It should be noted that throughout the entirety of One Piece (thus far), there is absolutely NO explanation behind the mechanics of Devil Fruits and their effects on humans. Some people will undoubtedly take umbrage with this, but I don't. One of the things that irritate me the most when it comes down to shonen anime and manga in recent years is the fact that there's always NEEDS to be an explanation to EVERY SINGLE THING. Don't get me wrong, there's always going to be shit that will need explaining, but I find it infuriating whenever there has to be some sort of pseudo-scientific explanation given for practically EVERYTHING that happens to our characters whenever they gain/use a superpower. In One Piece, the Devil Fruit superpowers are indeed important but they're not the overall focus of the plot. I suppose you can consider the Devil Fruit powers to be analogous to Nen from Hunter x Hunter or chakra from Naruto if you need something you can compare it to (even then, it's not quite like those two). Another thing to note is that no two Devil Fruits will bestow the exact same power. ***THE STORY*** One of the biggest problems that the One Piece anime suffers from is a VERY slow start. Like most shonen series, the story of One Piece is told arcs. The first 61 or so episodes encompass what I like to call the ""East Blue"" arc (which comprises of several smaller sub-arcs). Basically, it's where Luffy is recruiting his crew and the various adventures that follow suit. By the end of Episode 31, the final crew member joins and the team is ready to set sail to the Grand Line... although that's not quite the case. After Sanji joins the team, Nami briefly defects as we go into an arc that dives into her own back-story before she returns and becomes a permanent fixture of the Straw Hat pirates. It's not that these episodes are bad or anything, but I just got done telling you all this amazing shit that happens in the previous section and yet none of that shit actually goes down until AFTER these episodes. Well... to be fair, these episodes were produced well over a decade ago when the manga itself was still rather young. I suppose it's like Phantom Blood from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in the sense that it at least provides us with the foundation for these grand adventures to unfold. At the same time, I can't help but feel like Toei Animation could've at least skipped over some of the more superfluous stuff from the manga. Whatever, it's too late to do anything about that now. Aside from that, the story of One Piece is pretty damn good. For a series that's been going on for well over 15 years, it's surprising as to how consistent the overall story quality remains across the board. Yes, there are points where the storytelling takes a downturn, but this generally happens in filler arcs and whenever there's some excruciating padding in an episode to stretch out the chapters (more in the next section). Of course, there are also moments whenever you can tell that Oda didn't quite bring his A-game to the table in a particular arc. Yes, a man like Eiichiro Oda can also suffer from dry spells where his storytelling isn't quite up-to-par with what he usually brings to the table. He IS human, after all. Considering that One Piece is a shonen series, it's no surprise that themes of friendship and loyalty are quite prominent. What's more is that in a vein similar to ""classic"" shonen series like Dragon Ball, it's going to be a tale of adventure that is rather light in tone (for the most part). Does this mean that One Piece is automatically childish garbage? HELL TO THE FUCKING NO. Surprisingly enough, One Piece is fairly capable of taking itself seriously when the time comes for it to do so and what's more is that friendship/loyalty will ALWAYS be themes no matter what since those are hallmarks of the genre. No sense in complaining about something that's part of the course, you know... The overall arc structure of One Piece is fairly predictable, but that's not an inherently bad thing since it does offer a degree of consistency with the storytelling. The basic formula generally goes like this: the Straw Hats land on an island -> residents of the island hate them -> the Straw Hats meet the island's bad guy(s) -> they beat the bad guys -> residents of the island now love the Straw Hats. Keep in mind that this is simply the framework for an arc and the way an arc actually plays out may very well end up surprising you. This goes back to One Piece's greatest strength: giving us amazing adventures that are so grand in scope to the point where you can't look away from the screen for a moment. ***THE FILLER*** Surprisingly enough, Toei Animation did a relatively good job of remaining filler-free in a series as long as One Piece (roughly 98 episodes). It also helps that most of the filler arcs tend to be rather short (typically 2-5 episodes) across 670 episodes. It also helps that a good portion of them basically got their origins from ideas that Eiichiro Oda wanted to put in the manga but couldn't for various reasons. But does that mean they're worth watching? Well... I suppose you can go ahead and sit through the filler but the G8, Ice Hunter, and Ocean's Dream arcs are the only ones that I consider worth watching since the other filler arcs tend to be more hit/miss. Going back to how Toei Animation mostly managed to subvert filler, it was through adaptation expansion. Eiichiro Oda is a guy who packs quite a lot of detail into his stories, so it's easy for writers to expand upon concepts he brought up but didn't quite flesh out. Unfortunately, Toei Animation has this nasty habit of taking things too far. While the adaptation expansion was good enough that occasionally bordered on great in the first half of the anime, the latter half of the series (Episode 405-onward) is where Toei Animation's adaptation expansion takes a downward turn for the worse. After the Sabaody arc, Toei Animation decided to up and scrap the idea for filler episodes entirely and instead adapt the chapters at a 1:1 ratio. Considering the fact that not every chapter will have ~20 minutes' worth of stuff to adapt, Toei Animation had to improvise and they did so by means of VERY excruciating padding. It REALLY got ridiculous in the Marineford arc where you're basically panning over shots of the crew and have to put up with Buggy's pitiful attempts at comedy. It even got to a point where they showed one character looking for milk before going back to a fight. Now with that said, it DOES get better and it's really noticeable after the time skip but it's too little, too late by that point since the time skip is fairly recent (around episode 515?). ***THE CHARACTERS*** Considering the fact that One Piece has been going on for 15+ years, it's no surprise that there would be a LOT of characters. A good deal of them show up later on in the show/manga's run, but the vast majority of them are more or less just there for one arc before the focus of the story shifts to the next arc. Surprisingly enough though, even characters that have been around for just one arc were fairly well-developed and rather likeable like Dr. Kureha whose only appearance is in the Drum Island arc. There are certain characters who stick around with the Straw Hats for more than one arc (i.e. Vivi), but they're few and far between. Despite that, they receive more than enough screen time to the point where you feel like something's missing once the time comes for them to depart. For the vast majority of One Piece, we're stuck with the Straw Hat pirates: a rag-tag bunch of misfits with their own share of issues that also have such large bounties on their heads that rival Vash the Stampede's. The leader of the Straw Hats is none other than the rubbery Monkey D. Luffy. For lack of better words, Luffy is well... an idiot. What's more is that he's a gluttonous idiot in a vein similar to Goku or Naruto but thankfully he's not THAT extreme. A good benchmark as to how much you'll like Luffy is how well you can tolerate his airhead behaviour since it does get rather ridiculous at times. Regardless, he's got quite a few good traits to back him up and without Luffy, there would be no adventure, which would fucking SUCK. My favourite character would definitely have to be a tie between Roronoa Zoro (the swordsman) and Sanji (the chef). Why? Well... it's a combination of cool factor AND the fact that they play off of each other (and Luffy) rather well. I just can't get enough of their constant snark toward one another, nor can I ever get enough of Zoro's santoryu (3-sword style) or Sanji's ridiculously powerful kicks. That's not to say that the rest of the Straw Hats are forgettable, boring, or whatever because that is NOT the case at all. What I love most about the Straw Hats is that despite the predominant focus on Luffy, each member receives a good amount of development and time to shine on-screen. Of course, what are protagonists without their villains? Suffice it to say, Eiichiro Oda's creativity leads to us having quite a lot of interesting villains. Some of them are fucking AWESOME (like Enel in the Skypiea arc) while others are well... lame and stupid (like Buggy in the Orange Town arc). Honestly, this is something you'll have to put up with over the course of One Piece. You think that a limitless well of creativity is free? Oh fuck no! While Eiichiro Oda manages to hit the mark 95% of the time, there are moments where you have to put up with some of his ideas for villains that aren't stupid in an awesome way but are instead just well... stupid (ref: Buggy). Thankfully, arc villains aren't the only ones that the Straw Hats have to deal with. Considering the fact that the Grand Line is so vast in scope, there are a LOT of threats that the Straw Hats have to put up with, two of which being the Marines and the Seven Warlords of the Sea. The Marines are essentially your maritime police force which deals with pirates while the Seven Warlords are essentially government-sanctioned pirates. In exchange for a cut of the treasure that the Seven Warlords find, the government allows them to basically pick off smaller pirate ships that try to traverse through the Grand Line. Whenever an arc deals with one of the Seven Warlords, there's no doubt that it will be intense. ***THE ART AND ANIMATION*** If the seemingly childish concept, Luffy's stupidity, or the sheer length won't repulse you, chances are that the artwork will make or break your overall experience. Personally, I feel like Eiichiro Oda's artwork has quite a unique charm to it. What I love most about it is that there isn't a single anime/manga series out there that has this exact art style (and before you say anything, Fairy Tail does NOT count). I can understand why some people wouldn't like it since it's rather cartoony and most shonen series nowadays tend to have realistic character designs. Regardless, Hunter x Hunter has a similar ""cartoony"" art style and yet people praise the everliving Christ out of it so if you're gonna talk smack about One Piece's artwork but not levy the same criticism against Hunter x Hunter, you're too stupid for words. Of course... there is one little gripe I have with the art style and that is the fan service. Seriously... One Piece's fan service is something that I can never quite get accustomed to despite having watched the anime AND read the manga for well over 6-7 years. Maybe it's just me, but I really don't find huge tits on top of a skinny waist and lanky limbs to be that attractive. If that weren't bad enough, post-timeskip Nami's outfit is essentially a bikini-top and low-riding pants. Come on, Oda! You expect me to believe that Nami just went through a growth spurt? Don't lie, she paid Chopper to give her a boob job and you know it. Same goes for Nico as well! But, I digress. While I can certainly complain about it all I want, the fan service isn't as bad as OTHER popular shonen series (i.e. Akame ga Kill, Fairy Tail). As for the actual animation itself, it pains me to say that Toei Animation doesn't really have that good of a track record when it comes down to animation quality because they have this nasty habit of producing several long-running anime series alongside one another as they're airing while rotating between animation teams that tend to vary wildly in terms of quality. There's a tendency to go off model every few episodes and it's actually gotten a lot sloppier in the more recent episodes with character proportioning changing at the drop of a hat (let's hope that these animation errors get fixed in an upcoming Blu-ray release or something). The first 206 episodes were more or less par for the course from Toei Animation. There was a lot of good, a good deal of penny pinching along the way, fights were decently animated but nothing worth getting excited over, etc. Episode 207 is when the show makes the switch to HD and a 16:9 resolution and from that point forward, the animation became more fluid and the artwork became a lot cleaner as it ditched some of the line effects and such that it used in the earlier episodes. A general rule of thumb I use is that if an episode I'm watching on Funimation's website has been dubbed, I'll watch the dub instead because dubbed anime generally uses the footage AFTER it's been cleaned up of most of its off-model errors. ***THE SOUNDTRACK*** Unfortunately, there wasn't a lot about One Piece's OST that really caught the fancy of my ears which is quite bizarre since there's usually one or two pieces of BGM that would stand out to my ears while watching. The OP/ED themes are fair enough, and I do have a fondness for a few of them (although I forget their numbers and I'm WAY too lazy to look them up at this point). I will say this though: Skypiea had some pretty damn good BGM even though I couldn't remember any specific tracks that stood out. ***THE DUBS*** If you've ever done a basic Google search on One Piece, you'll probably find out that it had a rather turbulent distribution history here in the USA. It was initially picked up by 4Kids Entertainment and was aired on FOX during Saturday mornings (only to eventually air on Toonami during Saturday nights). Unfortunately, 4Kids has this nasty habit of editing the anime they license WAY past the point of compliance with FCC guidelines. For a full list of 4Kids edits, you can Google it. Most One Piece fans will urge you to stay away from the dub and honestly... I can't really blame them for that (especially now, since Funimation has been distributing One Piece for damn near 7 years and their dub is significantly better). But if we were to take away the content edits that 4Kids was responsible for and focus solely on the actual dubbing, you'd be quite surprised. The actual dubbing isn't quite bad and if you want a real surprise, Marc Diraison (the voice of Guts in the English dub of Berserk) voices Roronoa Zoro in the 4Kids dub of One Piece. It's no stretch of the imagination to think that he's my favourite performance in the entire dub. Erica Schroeder, the voice of Luffy did a fair enough job in her role but some of her lines came off as a bit forced and unnatural (although I blame the ADR director for that, since the woman really is a talented voice actress). As for the Funimation dub, I'd have to say that it's pretty damn good stuff. It's common to hear dub haters say that Colleen Clinkenbeard as Luffy and Brina Palencia as Tony Tony Chopper make their ears bleed, but that judgement is really left up to you. Both Clinkenbeard and Palencia do a great job with the roles they've been given, but I will concede that they can get rather irritating at times (of course, I blame the characters since their voices can be grating in the Japanese dub too). However, my favourite performances would definitely have to be Luci Christian as Nami and Christopher Sabat as Zoro (although I wish that Marc Diraison was still Zoro's voice actor because Guts). It's nice to hear Luci Christian's regular voice and Christopher Sabat not being a large ham and I wish more Funi dubs would play them straight rather than having Christian and Sabat doing exaggerated roles. ***ANIME VS. MANGA/HOW TO WATCH*** When it comes down to anime vs. manga, the manga always wins hands-down for one simple reason: lack of padding. Were it not for Toei Animation's overuse of padding, I'd heartily recommend the anime over the manga since it does have quite a lot going for it. However, it should be noted that you can alternate between the anime and the manga so that you don't have to plough through 760+ chapters or spend 6 months trying to catch up to the One Piece anime. Thankfully, the One Piece wikia can tell you what chapter(s) the episode you're watching is adapting and vice-versa. Rather than sitting through the first 61 episodes, what I recommend is reading the first 100 or so chapters from the manga (it's not as much as it sounds, trust me) and then moving over to the anime at Episode 62. If you ever feel like an episode is dragging on in pace, look up the episode on the One Piece wikia and see what chapter(s) it's adapting, then go ahead and read the corresponding chapter so you don't have to sit through 20+ minutes of something that you could easily read in less than 3-4 minutes. If you feel like the chapter you're reading is confusing or whatever, look it up on the One Piece wiki and then watch the corresponding episode. It's as simple as that, really. What made you think you had to sit through all 670+ episodes to begin with? The manga does exist for a reason. ***FINAL THOUGHTS*** On the whole, One Piece is a very interesting beast to tackle. I like to imagine One Piece as the boss of the Big 3 with Naruto and Bleach standing by its side as its bumbling and incompetent henchmen. While the sheer episode count and turbulent distribution history may put you off from watching it, don't let that scare you. Whereas Studio Pierrot only began adapting Naruto and Bleach in 2005, One Piece has been going on since 1999 so of course there's going to be a stark difference in terms of episode count. For a series that's been going on for 15 years and counting with no end in sight any time soon, it's amazing as to how Eiichiro Oda is able to keep up this level of creativity. Are there low points? Of course, but thankfully they aren't THAT low and are instead very brief. Don't buy into the hate against this series since it's actually quite lovely. ***ALTERNATE ANIME RECOMMENDATIONS*** 1) Hunter x Hunter (2011) - The bonds between Gon, Killua, Kurapika, and Leorio are similar to the bonds shared between the Straw Hat pirates and what's more is that they both take place in bizarre worlds where fanciful occupations set the stage for tales of grand adventures just waiting to unfold. 2) InuYasha - Both InuYasha and One Piece are more about the journey rather than the destination itself. Both shows comprise of large arcs that are split up between many smaller, easy-to-watch sub-arcs and standalone episodes. Both shows also put a lot of emphasis on friendship and trust (although InuYasha does so for different reasons; it IS a partially romantic story, after all).",8,Recommended,"Nov 11, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d4feea5ae7,1,23549
"One Piss is hands down one of the most childish and badly written Shounen I've come across. There is absolutely nothing interesting about One Piss. It fails at literally everthing it tries to attempt. These are the reasons why One Piss is trash. STORY: 0/10 One Piss is about a trash character called ""Luffy"" that wants to become the pirate king. He gathers a crew of even more awful characters that also have dreams of their own. Almost all of these characters are one dimensional and do absolutely nothing to accomplish their goals. Nami wants to draw a map of the world, yet there isn't a single scene in the manga showing her draw anything. Usopp wants to be a brave warrior, yet after 800+ episodes he's still a coward. Sanji wants to find All Blue, he does absolutely nothing to accomplish his dream. Luffy wants to become pirate king yet there are so many filler arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with this. Here are some examples of arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story: Alabasta, Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Drum Kingdom, etc. None of these arcs have anything to do with Luffy becoming the pirate king, yet they each are at least 40 chapters. Even the arcs that are actually relevant are awful. Dressrosa is one of the most poorly written Shounen arcs I've come across. 120 episodes of one arc, bad characters that get too much screen time, generic villain with a generic back story, terrible animation, slow pacing, etc. It cant get any worse than that. For some reason Oda isn't capable of making a story arc that isn't extremely long anymore. He says that he isn't going to make long arcs after dressrosa, yet he makes even more bad arcs that are too long. One Piss arcs are essentially the same thing every single time. The plot is very formulaic. They go to an island and make friends, beat up the bad guys that are oppressing the country, new cremember (sometimes), feast, and then repeat. I mean it continues this bullshit over and over again for over 800 episodes. It already starts to get boring during the Skypiea arc, I'm surprised I could actually tolerate the rest of this trash. One Piss has some of the worst fights I've seen in Shounen. It's actually hilarious how One Piss fans criticize other Shounen like Fairy Tail because of ""friendship powerups"". One Piece does the exact same thing. Every single fight is won by Luffy's sheer willpower, not because he actually outsmarted his opponent. Every One Piss fight is the same exact thing: Luffy tanks evey hit, villain tanks every hit, but then somehow the villain loses because he isn't as durable as Luffy. This is why One Piece fights are extremely boring. It always just ends in asspulls/plot armor. Luffy has won many fights that he shouldn't have won, especially his battle against Katakuri. Katakuri injures himself because a random character interfered in their fight. If you cant see how much a contrived plot device that is, then I don't know what to tell you. One thing One Piece fans praise about this series is how good the world building is. In my opinion, it doesn't mean SHIT if One Piece has good world building. Why should I care about how detailed Oda made the world of One Piece when the crew is just stuck on one island for 100 chapters? The world building is irrelevant if we barely even get to see the rest of the world, besides the Island they spend 200 chapters on. For fucks sake they've only been on 5 for over 300 episodes. CHARACTERS: 0/10 There are rarely any interesting characters in One Piss For the most part, all of the main characters are poorly written. They just get their sad and generic backstories and then they never get character development again. A perfect example of this would be Nami. Sad backstory, then gets no development for the rest of the series. Usopp is another example. After 800 episodes, Usopp still is acting like a coward. 800 episodes and yet he still didn't develop whatsoever. I used to like Sanji until post time skip One Piss completely ruined him. He hasn't had any shine in post timeskip. He loses every damn fight, and he wasn't even in the most important arc of the timeskip. Then Oda makes an arc all for Sanji, which ended up being absolute trash. He just gets a generic sad backstory, doesn't actually change as a character, and then he still gets no shine whatsoever. No one should ever compare this trash character to Zoro. Speaking about Zoro, he's the only straw hat that actually developed as a character. Luffy is hands down the worst Shounen protagonist of all time. Luffy has no character development. None whatsoever. He has no internal characterization at all. None. Any chance he had at character development was ruined because he just ends up going back to how he previously was. If an anime/manga is over 800 chapters/episodes long and the main character doesn't have the abiltiy to reflect on his actions, then that's an absolute problem for the story. To be honest, there's nothing interesting about Luffy. He's just the basic Shounen protagonist that we always see in any Shounen. There are no good villains in One Piece. The only villain I enjoyed is Crocodile, yet he's just a generic villain anyways. Besides him, every other villain is bad. There are no complex villains in One Piece. None whatsoever! ANIMATION/ART: 0/10 Do I even need to explain this? One Piece has the WORST animation I've ever seen in ANY anime. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree with this. I've never seen a Shounen with worse artstyle than One Piece. The characters look extremely ugly too, especially in the Whole Cake Island arc. I don't know why Oda loves drawing ugly ass characters. ENJOYMENT: 1/10 How can I possibly enjoy an anime that has bad characters and a bad plot? The truth is, I cant. It was at least decent until Oda completely destroyed his manga. The only reason I gave it a 1 is because of Zoro OVERALL: 1/10",1,Not Recommended,"Jan 9, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_318f4a7c0d,2,5889
"Well not long ago started watching this series and now have ""watched"" quite a lot. And I don't get how people have so a high opinion of this series. Story: Is quite boring honestly, if you like to watch the same joke 10 * in an episode for 700+ episodes then this series might be for you. Nothing interesting happens until the Summit War arc. In that arc, there was an interesting development in characters and connections to other characters. And during that time there Luffy did as he pleases and didn't give a damn what others were thinking. That is the only reason I gave this series even 6, would have been 4 or even 3 without that arc. But at Fishman Island arc it went back to boring as there doesn't seem to be any reason for any fighting again. Art: Well, quality in art is like a roller coaster in this series, some scenes it is good, and some are bad. But I like the old feeling what art style gives and that's why I rated it to 6. Could have been much higher if the quality would be stable good. Color themes are also pretty good in this and seem to be they're not scared to use colors what I'm happy about. Sound: To be honest, nothing too fancy but the quality is mostly stable if some side character voice actors are not counted in. Music could be better in some situations but good overall. Character(s): Well, characters in this series are 90% of boring or fanservice. There is no character development in this series so I don't get how this series is even going on anymore. Luffy: Pretty good character but I have watched over 500 episodes and still personality is exactly the same as the beginning of the first episode of the whole series. As a fighter, he is getting stronger but it doesn't feel like it at all because still sidekicks give him hard time. I know when they go deeper in Grand line there are stronger mobs but honestly. Usopp: 90% of boredom. He doesn't have growth at all in the whole series as a person. As a fighter, he has grown a little but his personality ruins this character wholly for me, crying help or crying to Luffy to stop all the time. That's everything this character is, nothing more or less. I don't even get a reason for this character because of... Tony Tony Chopper: Chopper is pretty similar to Usopp but he gets things done if the situation requires it. Chopper is as a character is a direct upgrade for Usopp. He cries also for Luffy to stop and cries for help but if the situation requires it he can get things done what Usopp doesn't. Pretty interesting character and this one I would keep in this series. Nami: This character is 100% of fanservice and nothing else. She doesn't have anything to give to series and can be also annoying you-know-what. I hoped when I first time saw when she was rescued by Luffy that she is just a side character who drops after she's arc end but no. Zoro: This is a most interesting character in the whole series, he is the only one who has grown as a person in the whole crew, and that's pretty sad considering how long this series has already run. Sanji: After Usopp, this is the second most boring character in the whole series. He has not developed as a person nor as a fighter at all. And his obsession with women, a joke that is gone for too long and got boring already. I hope he dies on a nosebleed somewhere. Not gonna miss him at all. Brook: Can be a quite interesting character but feels like he's going to be in the same category as Sanji. Same joke over and over again and does not do anything new. At first in Thriller Bark arc he seemed a really interesting character and was quite good but when I went to Luffy's boat he went to the bottom, he honestly doesn't give anything new to the series and seems to be he is just there for filling Sanji, Usopp and Chopper joke so they don't repeat same joke 3 jokes whole episode but 4. Nico Robin: Sometimes just for fanservice but much better character than Nami. Personality much better and honestly in a big role to drive the story forward. Franky: Last but not least, this character got interesting design as a character and he has grown quite a lot. I hope they don't ruin this because Franky got a lot of potential as MC. Enjoyment: Well as I said in the story, this series is quite boring and I have been ""watching"" this. Only ""watching"" not watching cause it's hard to enjoy the same jokes over 500 episodes. And usually, I keep this rolling for background sound so when I'm doing other things. I had quite high hopes for this series because this has run so long but looks like expectations were crushed hard. Most likely I watch this series till it ends but just for background noise, not for entertainment. Overall: Well this section is more like TL;DR for me - Do you like to watch the same joke in every episode till you die? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - Do you like series that are 90% fanservice and otherwise boring? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - Do you like characters don't grow at all (even after 500 episodes)? sure, watch this. Otherwise, stay d*mn far from it. - If you want to watch this you can skip straight to the Summit War arc cause there isn't any development in this series so you won't miss anything.",4,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9d8cab9d7f,2,5230
"One Piece is definitely a must-watch anime series if anyone is looking for an amazing series with tons of character development, an intricate and engrossing story, very emotional moments, character companionship, some amazing fight scenes, as well as a lot of comedic moments. This anime has been in the top 10 in Japan for a long time, and for good reason. Right from the get go, the anime introduces you to Monkey D. Luffy, our protagonist of the anime, as well as a few more of his crew that will be sailing the Grand Line with him. Each character that ultimately ends up joining the Strawhat pirates all have a big dream that they want to follow, and usually, that is the reason as to why they join to crew. It's amazing to see how everyone's dream is tied together and Oda has woven it almost flawlessly. Each character also has their strengths and weaknesses which come into play throughout the entire anime. If you haven't tried One Piece, I urge you to give this show a try. If you're not used to its animation, please, don't let that be the sole reason that you don't watch this show. In time, you'll grow to love the animation, and as the series goes on, the animation just gets better and more crisper than before.",9,Recommended,"Jun 1, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9d66c8e251,2,1225
"Oh, I can tell I am getting my full of Battle Shounens for the day. And maybe for the week. So it's time to put away revisiting Hitman Reborn for a while and review an anime I watched recently. One Piece...oh boy. This is a difficult one to review. So let me just say this outright. There are two ways to review something. One, you compare it with its peers and see how it stands. And the other you test it on it's own merits. And you are probably going to say, ""Oh test it on it's own merits that is good!"" Well, I tend to do the former because that is the more Capitalistic of the two. Comparing it with it's peers to see whether or not you should take your time and money elsewhere. And in the end, the former fits more with the dictionary definition of a consumer review. And here's the ""but"". But One Piece's peers are all Battle Shounens, and One Piece is an Action Adventure (Shounen is implied here because Action Adventure is usually aimed at a younger audience). Now, One Piece is an Action Adventure who is competing with other Battle Shounens...so you see my predicament. How can I compare something to other things outside of its genre? It just doesn't work. And that is just not plain fair. But I must compare it to it's peers because it is competing with Naruto, and Bleach, and even smaller ones like Medaka Box, and the aforementioned Hitman Reborn. I must also do this because I have not seen any Action Adventure animes, and I can't compare it to stuff I haven't seen! So, I must grade it as if it were a Battle Shounen. Story: Usually Battle Shounens have bad stories, but this one takes the cake. This is the vaguest plot I have ever seen. And that is because there is no plot. There is no structure. You can look at Naruto and say that there is an overall plot and story line that adds up when you add in all of the arcs. But One Piece doesn't have that. The only plot that is in the show is when the characters are arrive at a new Island. Story: 1/10 Characters: Now before you stop reading this review and hit the ""Not Helpful"" button out of rage. Or God-forbid begin hate commenting on my profile or even sending me death threats because your favorite animu doesn't have a plot; let me get onto the characters. The characters in One Piece are surprisingly well written...To an extent. They all have their own goals and their own struggles which make them all grow together as a team. As a character story this anime does fairly well. Most of the arcs are there for the sole purpose of characterizing one of the characters more. And that is fine, but my question is as follows: Why have none of the characters have had lives outside of seven years old? Let me explain, whenever a character has a flashback to their past they are always seven years old, or a similar age. What, have they been stuck in the hyperbolic time chamber for their entire lives? I mean seriously all of these characters are in their early to late twenties.... What? They are in their teens? No way, those ages are arbitrary, there is no way Sanji is nineteen. And Luffy is seventeen. No way, Sanji is obviously in his late twenties. Maybe 28 or 29. But not Nineteen. And Luffy looks like he is 21. Who are they trying to fool? Seriously. And after the timeskip, Sanji looks like he is in his early thirties. I mean, he even has his Italian porno stache going on. But I am digressing. I am sure that these characters have had some other life changing conflicts outside of a very young age. I mean, the characters get more substance as they go on, it's just I feel that they could have done their initial characterization differently. Characters: 7/10 Sound: I have had no problems with the sound, there are no tracks that particularly stood out to me or ones that I just hated. Sound 7/10 Art: The art is definitely at the beginning of the series a 4/10. But over the years One Piece has gotten with the times and upgraded it's art to a 8/10. So I met it halfway and it is a 6/10. Length: This is a special criteria that will be added into the overall score because I feel that this needs to be mentioned. This show is 600+ episodes long. I love my long running series, Dragonball Z and Yu Yu Hakusho come to mind. But those were all 200-300 episodes long. And there is definitely a point where a show gets too long. Yes, Naruto is reaching it's 600th episode as well, if it has not already gotten there (I read the manga). But with Naruto you have the break between the original and Shippuden to break up the monotony. So, I think that One Piece being as long as it is is detrimental to the series. It makes it intimidating for the newcomers to the series, like me, to get into the show. It's like, ""Well, where do I start?"" And beginning at the beginning is a long and hard road to get through, man. And you can't begin somewhere after the beginning because the characters are consistent in their characterization. It's not like Bleach where events happen and they are never mentioned again. One Piece is consistent to the point where the characters are constantly referring to past events. And after their characters get going, this becomes more frequent later on down the road. The time skip is an example. So I am going to rate length like this. 10 being the perfect length for the show, like Madoka Magica. And 1 being so long, or so short, that there is no time to tell the story or characterize the characters, think Angel Beats. So the Length gets a, 4/10. Fights: After giving length it's own special criteria in this review. I hesitate to add another special criteria. But since a lot of peopl- fanboys talk about the fights and compare it to Bleach; I feel they would not be justified if I don't put this in here. For the fights I have not seen with getting as far as I did; I have looked up on YouTube and watched. So, the fights are short. Like, really short. Most of the fights are below 15 minutes with all of the bull edited out. Bull being talking and scene transitioning to see what all of the other characters are doing for a couple of episodes. And this just does not compare when the same thing is done to other shows like Dragonball Z where if all of the bull is edited, the fights go on for 2:40:37 straight. Don't believe me? Citation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB45FE6y_wg So these are the shortest fights, but length shouldn't really matter, shouldn't it? And it wouldn't matter if the fights were sweet. And they are for the most part. I just wish that some fights were longer, like the fight between Luffy and the ""Door Door"" guy with the bull horns. I forget his name. But unfortunately the fight was wasted because the entire point of it was to show off Luffy's new ability. And that is not to mention that some of the fights completely break my willing suspension of disbelief. Like the fight between Zoro and Kaku. I can't explain this with words. Just here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6WtrRogy_w And the joke is that this is supposed to be taken seriously. I saw a similar post in the comments. And that person was bombarded with One Piece sales figures to try and justify this. But I noticed that in doing so the One Piece fanboys dodged the question: How can anyone take this seriously? I'm sorry, but I can't. Fights: 3/10 Edit: Oops It appears I forgot the enjoyment criteria, forgive me. Please. Enjoyment: Personally I don't like Action Adventure shows. 2/10 Overall: I guess I should end this with a miraculous conclusion that summs up everything and wraps it all up with a nice bow to boot. But I don't have the energy. Overall 6/10. Edited with Enjoyment this makes the Overall score 5.8/10 rounded up is a 6/10...wow.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_50c0494079,2,7668
"One of the best anime i have ever seen, at points its not as interesting as other anime, but over all it is amazing. One Piece is an anime about pirates and dreams.. but mostly about dreams. Monkey D Luffy is a character that everyone has to love, he\'s the captain with the strongest dream and love of his crew, but he doesn\'t really act like a captain at all, instead of ordering everyone around, he\'s always just trying to have fun. He loves food, but expecially meat, its supprising how much he can eat. (WATCH THE ANIME!) He can stretch because he is made of rubber and his dream is to become the Pirate King. Roronoa Zoro is the firstmate and swordsman, he always carries around his 3 katana and he seems to care more about them than people. He loves his sake and has a good drink when ever possible, but like a true pirate, he never gets drunk. His dream is to become the best swordsman ever. Usopp is a sharpshooter and total liar. He often calls himself the captain. Can\'t really think of much to say that makes sense if you havnt watched the anime. His dream is to become a true man of the sea. Nami is the navigator who will suddenly change course for money. She takes control of the ship when Luffy is negleting his job and tells them to get a move on. Without Nami, everyone would be always arguing and they wouldn\'t be going anywhere (until Luffy grew up and started acting like a captain). Her dream is to draw a map of the world. Sanji is the cook. But watch out if you are a girl because he\'ll soon be running after you. He always runs after girls when he\'s not busy (generally, but he sometimes does when he is..). He cooks the best food around and is always inproving, but he favouratises the girls when he\'s cooking and gives them the nicest things. His dream is to find All Blue, (WATCH THE ANIME!). Tony Tony Chopper is the doctor, he\'s a reindeer who joins the crew. He can become a human, but he always keeps his blue nose. He\'s a really good doctor and a funny and cute character. (WATCH THE ANIME!) Finnally, Robin, She\'s an archieologist who used to be their enemy. When Luffy saved her when she just wanted to die and had nothing to live for, she joined the crew. Recently, something strange happened to them (WATCH THE ANIME!). She wants to find the rio poneglyph. (WATCH THE ANIME!) It is a very long series and no one wants it to end any time soon. It never gets boring and the characters are all perfectly made.",10,Recommended,"Jul 26, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ab4fb4626e,2,2453
"I give up. Most people do that before even starting when they see that the series has over 400 episodes. I've watched 490 of them and I just can't take it anymore! I really don't like dropping a series and I generally try to avoid doing so, but the reason to do so is quite plain and simple: this show is a waste of time. The first few story arcs are really interesting. I've even rewatched the episodes where Zoro joins Luffy a few times since it just really draws me in with its excellent story and characters. It's not like I just ""got used to"" the series and the newer episodes ""seem"" dull because of that; those early episodes were really just amazing. The filler episodes throughout the series are intolerable and water the series down greatly, but the main story arcs are quite interesting and can really hook you. The series kinda loses its charm after a couple hundred episodes, though they still keep it pretty fresh when they introduce a new main character. It's the filler that kills this series, really. One Piece appears pretty cartoony at first glance, maybe even stupid. Some of the characters look pretty cool despite that (such as Zoro and Trafalgar Law), and it's a little refreshing to see a group of characters that aren't just a bunch of sexy beasts. Characters like Usopp just look unappealing and ridiculous at first, but even a guy like him can seem really cool as his character develops. I've got no problems with the artstyle, and the series has many serious moments that are convincing enough to make you worry about the characters despite the cartoony look. The long opening themes are one thing, but the long recaps at the start of each episode are brutal and highly unnecessary. I think this problem starts around the Sky Island arc and continues on for the rest of the show. Anyhow, I'm quitting at the Marineford war. That was 30 episodes of Luffy endlessly running towards the platform shouting ""ACE!"" while Ace would shout ""LUFFY!"" and ""K...kh...hh...!"", whatever that means. Half of it was just random pirates and marines firing their guns towards off the screen. I think the ""war"" atmosphere was really just boring and not suited to One Piece, especially since the all the fillers made it appear very slowpaced. The show lost its emotion and intensity. There are better things to come, but I can't handle these worthless fillers anymore. One Piece is nearly 500 episodes long and it isn't going to end anytime soon; they're only halfway to One Piece and the real battle is just beginning. I'm sure there'll be peaceful people living happily in the ""New World"" just like in the rest of the Grand Line, though, despite the fact that it's supposed to be the most incredibly dangerous place in the world. 30 episodes of straight bullshit. Well, I'm sure the worthlessness and stalling amounted to at least 100 episodes. There are some truly incredible series that are only 24 episodes long; you'd do well to watch some of those instead of sitting through One Piece fillers. I recommend reading the manga instead; no fillers and the art is more interesting. I think I'd give One Piece a 9/10 if it weren't for the fillers. The last point would be saved for an ending, which this series will never have. Don't watch the fillers for completion's sake like I did; they really aren't worth it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 3, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bea1f0c4e5,2,3321
"Recently I started to notice that the One Piece fandom has become really toxic and likes to compare/attack other anime, claiming that ""One Piece is the best anime"" and I honestly don't understand it. The pacing alone disqualifies this anime from competing for the title of ""best"" not to mention the rest of the problems this anime has. I don't read the manga, it probably doesn't have such big problems with pacing as the anime but never mind... I haven't read it, I won't comment, I mean the ANIME which is far from what One Piece fans think about it... Let's start with the ultra awful pacing... it's best illustrated by comparison to Jojo (a manga that has a similar number of total pages as Ona Piece) out of 80 volumes of the manga there are 190 episodes of Jojo (parts 1-5) and ATTENTION... as many as 755 episodes of One Piece, this series is so stretched and doesn't compensate for it with anything. The One Piece anime, trying to prevent it from catching up with the source material (as other long series try to do), does the worst thing possible. Other similar series prevent this with filler episodes, One Piece stretches/dilutes the original plot to the limits of its possibilities, drastically reducing its value, in the case of other series, episodes that are not part of the main plot could be easily skipped, in the case of One Piece there is no such possibility because the filler is written into the episode, it's just a tragedy. But OK, this anime has terrible pacing but is the plot really good anyway? No, it's average and ultra formulaic. This anime had the potential to be a really good adventure anime, 1000 episodes give the opportunity to tell about really many adventures of our heroes, however (also touching on the pace) we are trapped for several hundred episodes in one place and once again, most of it is not compensated by anything special. Because yes, most of the arcs (apart from the mass of pointless, boring and too long plots in between) look almost identical, the schematic nature of this anime is terrifying: The crew arrives on a new island -> Luffy meets new friends who are terrorized by a bad guy -> Luffy and the rest split up, Luffy runs to the boss and the rest beat up the minions -> Luffy fights the boss as always and Zoro and Sanji fight the vice captains, there are some exceptions but overall it looks the same, without any surprises. The fact that the characters always run somewhere for almost half of each arc is already a meme. I'm not saying that the plot is tragic, it has a lot of good moments but it's still far from very good. Moving on... ""Dragonballization"" from the beginning of the Wano arc, this anime decided to start moving towards Dragon Ball, when previously the fights of the most popular characters in this universe looked good but still mundane, in the Wano Arc suddenly the power scale skyrocketed, they started introducing various colorful auras and a lot of different exaggerated effects, it introduces a huge inconsistency compared to the rest of the anime. It seems like One Piece is losing its entire atmosphere in favor of the exaggerated efficiency we see in today's shounen, but they have been like that from the beginning and do not seem inconsistent like One Piece, which started introducing all this crap relatively recently. One Piece lost a bit of ""it"" after the time skip, it seems like the character interactions became less natural, more forced and there are fewer of them in general due to more frequent character separation, some characters lost their character and meaning, Usopp and Chpper were mostly reduced to boring comic relief. Luffy (MC) well... his lack of development hurts me, the lack of development itself is not a bad thing BUT when the plot hits the hero with a traumatic event that screams ""you idiot, you have to learn from this"" and he gets up and moves forward without a moment's hesitation... it's stupid and makes this dramatic and important event irrelevant. Luffy lost his entire crew due to his own stupidity (he was convinced of it) and what does he do in the rest of the story? he repeats the same mistake without a moment's reflection and provokes the emperor without any real preparation, stupid characters are cool and funny until their stupidity is simply annoying and gives the feeling that the character is completely empty. Additionally, for the vast majority of the time, Luffy stood out because unlike other anime of this type, he does not have hidden powers, he motivated by the fact that with seemingly weak powers, thanks to his willpower, he was able to pursue his goal, cliché? Yes, it works? Yes, but the author decided to surprise everyone and make Luffy a divine chosen one with divine powers and all this in the name of what? The ""symbol of freedom"" narrative does not compensate for this because Luffy is ultimately no different in this respect from the rest of the typical shounen MC. Yes, Luffy is a ""symbol of freedom"" even though he doesn't see himself as such, but in the end it seems like he's just an idiot and does whatever he wants, the fact that he frees the oppressed doesn't matter because he only does it when his friends are imprisoned, his perspective is limited and if he doesn't see that someone has a problem he won't help them, he won't stop the world government which is a symbol of oppression xD but still, being a ""symbol of freedom"" doesn't require being a divine chosen one at the same time, what's the value of all that determination Luffy has and everything he's been through so far? if at the end, when the ceiling was too high, the author came up with an ultra big plot twist and gave MC divine powers is completely uninspiring and contradicts what we've seen in most of One Piece. All that I wrote above is not everything, there would definitely be something more, but I didn't sit with a notebook in my hand while watching this anime and I don't remember everything, so well....

"One Piece starts great. It has original setting for its time, it introduces the best hook in all shounen anime, important characters are nicely fleshed out, the main character cannot one punch every enemy, and the story doesn’t feel like the original creator has run out of ideas. But this was many years ago. It doesn't look like an anime worth watching in 2017. Since One Piece was first published in 1997 as a manga, and was animated in 1999, it took decades to tell the story. Its creator Eiichiro Oda had just graduated from high school back in the 1990s. He kept writing the same story well into his middle ages. I grew old watching and reading One Piece. I sometimes wonder how many fans have died waiting for the story to end. Please, if you ever create a story do end it before your youngest readers get their menopause or other age-related changes. Fans aren’t immortals to indulge storytellers. Even Eiichiro Oda is taking more and more breaks to take care of his health. Otherwise he cannot continue the work. One Piece has one unique element that is hard to find in other long-airing anime. Its story is solid. It has actually two different storylines which Oda skillfully combines into a single plot. The first is the story of Straw Hat Pirates led by Luffy. The second is the history of the world of One Piece. As Straw Hat pirates continue their adventures they also discover the truth about their world. The pirate king who died decades ago left a great treasure called One Piece which somehow can change the fate of the world. The world government fights against pirates who want to become the next pirate king by finding that incredible treasure. As you can see, the lives of individual characters are more or less related to the world’s history. It makes the story more realistic. More, these two parallel storylines in a single plot make the anime even more interesting when they meet. This double-storyline method makes it possible for the lives of different characters to be intertwined naturally. In One Piece supporting characters have lives of their own. Every character is also part of the world depicted. They don’t feel like talking heads in the void. Their lives are not isolated from each other. Because the history of the world is so vast, there’s always something going on behind the stage. Actions of important people belonging to the world of One Piece have crucial importance. They can change the fate of the world. Furthermore, the aftermath of crucial battles does have repercussions for others as well. By careful storytelling Eiichiro Oda succeeds in preventing the main character from becoming an undisputed god in power. Another feature of this method is that there is actually more organic tragedy in One Piece. Overall, One Piece stands out for its original storytelling for shounen, but sadly, like all long-lasting stories, it got old. Its creator got old. Its fans got old. The world got old.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 9, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_af0028e4ea,2,2939
"Well where do i start ... there is so much to say.. for the super fans of One Piece, i'm going to punish this anime so this review may piss you off. This anime, like any other big shonen, made a crucial mistake that i'm going to explore, besides that, the rest is fine. Story: 7/10. Well.. it is hard to explain this rate. Is the plot original and creative? Yes it is, but it does not sound nice ! It seems like they started with a decent plot, and then they just keep adding things to make it bigger. I mean, the plot doesn´t need to be 'stupid'. I don´t mind if there is unicorns or mermaids or even islands in the sky but keep adding things will not make the plot better. But this is not the main reason for this rate .. The story takes to much time to be developed.. I mean we have arcs with 60 eps or even more.. i've seen animes with 24 with more content than these arcs with 60 or more eps .. the pace is just to damn slow which makes the anime boring at some point. Plus, we can have one hundred different islands, each one with something different, if the story is always the same, it won´t make us hooked. Because yes it's always the same, we have a bad powerfull guy that took control of the island, and the weak good guys asked for Luffy's help and that's basically the entire anime is all about ... and ofc Luffy will always win. If the plot is always the same thing throughout 700 eps, there is no way for it to be good ! Besides all of those bad points, there is a good point.. the ""Akuma no mi"", those fruits that grants them powers are really nice. We have so many different powers and we always want to know which power the bad guy has. Because we never know, there are so many.. Art: 7/10. The anime starts with a crappy art, but then gets better with the time but never reached great levels ... the action sometimes has no detail. Some special movements or attacks we can´t even see them (especially when is about swordsman .. i mean they use their special movement, but we don´t see him actually using it, we just see the enemy being hit.. and that just sucks). The background is reasonable at least so as the character design. Sound: 8/10. Nice openings .. all of them portray the happy theme that One Piece talks about (friendship). The OSTs are reasonable enough to make the action and the drama good. Character: 8/10. For me, the best point here. We have nice characters with a nice development and a nice past (actually when they were telling the past of some character, i nearly cried at some, because they were dramatic enough to make me care a lot.) BUT .. it's like watching the same character every single time. All of them can be resumed to this sentence: ""I care about my friends so i'm going to protect them at any cost"" .. basically they look like this.. About the villians .. we have some nice villians actually .. they make us hate them, so when they get defeated we feel relieved xD but they are also the same shit. The motivations are always the SAME (take control of something, usually the island). So .. we don´t have that variety of characters that we see in other animes .. It's basically the good guys vs the bad guys .. Enjoyment: 7/10. This anime starts being good as hell, with nice fights and nice development but .. it was good because it was new for me. When i was in the 500th ep or so i was like ""yh yh let's move on to the fights instead i don´t care about your story !!!"" .. and there is even some arcs that were painfull to watch .. Overall : 6/10.. this anime is just too big .. it has nice characters, nice development and even a interesting plot .. but not for 700 eps .. if you are looking for some nice action anime, or even some nice shonen .. well you can watch this one, at least the first few arcs because those are good but i think it doesn´t worth, if you are like me, when you start something and then you have to end it, well don´t touch in this anime. Because you will get bored.. it's just to damn long. Furthermore, it gets repetitive so i don´t see the point in watching this.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 20, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9dfa63e5cb,2,4048
"Okay, this is a LONG series, so it's kinda hard to review it as a whole because I feel completely differently at different points of the series. So I'll break it up into three sections My overall score is based on the last section though. First Section [Episodes 1 - 223] I'd call this a pretty fun anime almost out of the gate. It was really exciting seeing a very unique world, unique premise and interesting characters to wonder about right away. I really enjoyed that a lot of characters were introduced very early on as very powerful people, but we were totally left to wonder about them. This is very essential to getting people excited about what's to come. As far as the characters go, although they are all pretty one dimensional, they are all very likeable (except for Usopp, I can't stand him). Luffy is kinda hard to hate and there is someone to like for everyone in the series. The story definitely drags a bit. Lot's of filler and pointless sub-plots that drag on for several episodes, but still pretty enjoyable. The main plot continued to thicken and it definitely was alive enough to keep me watching. Second Section [Episodes 223 - 516] I'd say this is definitely the best section in the anime. This is essentially the build up to the Whitebeard arc, but not before going to Water Seven and really spicing up the story with new, powerful characters and big character development between Luffy's crewmates. Water Seven was good, but the chapter after that was a bit dull. Kinda just waiting for what eventually became the Whitebeard arc. Once that started, I was at the edge of my seat watching it all the way through. It does go on and on and on, but you finally get to see some badass characters fight and Luffy really stepping up in power quite a bit. Very fun watch, even though some episodes are worth skipping. I very much liked this anime up until this point. Third Section [Episodes 516 - 677 (ongoing)] Here is where I really started to fall off. At first it wasn't so bad, but I progressively realized that I wasn't looking forward to anything in this anime, and as soon as I caught up with the release cycle and was watching weekly since about episode 590, I realized that nothing was happening on an episode to episode basis and as it kept going, even less would happen in each episode. The last 20 episodes has been some of the worst. Every week I watch it for whatever reason, and every week I realize that I would have missed absolutely nothing if the whole episode was turned into a recap clip. Episodes don't really begin until about 4 minutes and 30 seconds in, and even then, it's essentially rehashing the last 5 minutes of the episode before that. They spend FAR too much screen time with reaction shots, sound effects and a bunch of shit that doesn't matter and very little with progressing the story line. I don't think there has been an episode in a while that would take more than 3-4 sentences to describe literally everything that happened. [Overall / Story / World] I do like the premise of the power system in One Piece. It's a pretty simple idea and pretty flexible. You obviously have to dismiss some stuff that simply don't make sense, but you fine with it... at least at the start of the story. Later on though, you quickly realize how unpolished the power system is. You have literally no balance at all. Bad guys will crazy OP powers can seemingly never exhaust their power, but Luffy is tired almost immediately after he starts a long fight. And as they add more concepts into the system, the more you think to yourself, why did we never see this before if everyone can fucking do it? They are all traveling the grand line, but seemingly every other pirate is waiting just ahead of Luffy waiting for him to catch up. Even with a 2 year gap, pirates haven't progressed at all down the grand line while it only took Luffy 1 year to travel the first half. The story just starts to break with time and characters are becoming progressively less interesting... However, it could be improve a lot if I didn't feel like I was wasting my time watching each episode because nothing fucking happens. (and yes, I'm including even episode 677. Doesn't justify the previous 20 being about a bunch of nothing).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2952fdcd1f,2,4249
"Where to begin!? One Piece is a very adventurous story. Never in one place for too long the story is full fun and unusual things. One Piece is about a rather childish 17 year old boy (Monkey D. Luffy) who aspires to reach his dreams of becoming Pirate King and keeping the promises he's made. Meeting many a friend along the way the story progresses through many story arcs that build the personality and integrity of each character. The first friend and crew member he makes is his ever faithful First Mate (Zoro) who also has a dream to achieve. I am not going to explain every character. That would take too long and it would spoil some of the fun. The best way to understand this anime is to watch it. One Piece is a really good story, perfect for anyone who likes pirate stories. Though a very long and yet unfinished story thus far, I find it to be very enjoyable. The comedy is some of the best I have seen in any anime. I recommend watching in its original japanese with english subtitles (preferably fan-subbed). The dubbed version by 4kids entertainment is TERRIBLE! They have also stopped dubbing it anyway. Funimation has taken over dubbing One Piece in English and has done a far better job. As far as fansub groups go, I recommend Kaizoku-Fansubs, Vegapunk and Instantz Noob Production. Kaizoku-fansubs (K-F)started subbing the series from the beginning and they are still subbing it today with flying colors. They are the way to go for most of the available episodes. The other groups have what goes after the episodes K-F has done so far. Good luck finding and downloading without any problems. Torrent is the easiest way to get them. Otherwise you can get them from IRC. This is my favorite anime above all so... Enjoy the show!",10,Recommended,"Apr 29, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_aabdde3a36,2,1745
"The premise is simple enough. The main character seeks to become the pirate king by finding a treasure called One Piece (you wonder where they come up with these English names ..) and starts by assembling a crew. The pattern then becomes sailing from island to island, finding problematic villains and sending them packing, gathering crew members, and meeting people. I had high expectations of One Piece. As one of the most popular and best-selling manga stories in Japan at the time (and still is) and of the shounen genre that I am fond of, I expected nothing less. So when Kaizoku-fansubs first started releasing good quality fansubs in 2003 (as compared to the HK rips, where calling the subtitles English is generous), I decided to give the series a shot. I was disappointed. As I began watching One Piece, it wasn’t as though I didn’t like the series at all. It was watchable. Generally enjoyable. It just failed to meet the expectations I had. That was probably the problem. I continued to watch the series on and off, with the early main characters (Luffy and Zoro) growing on me slowly, and Usopp knocking down my interest a bit. I started warming up to the series during Sanji’s arc. Finally, Nami’s arc sealed the deal. For those familiar with her arc, which I still feel is the best of the crew’s back stories, I can say there were multiple, very memorable moments. The feelings were real. I cried for the first time while watching this series. I cared very much for the characters, and for what happened to them. I went from lukewarm to obsessed about One Piece. Its been over 5 years since then, and I still consider One Piece to be one of my favorite stories, both the manga and anime adaptations. I think One Piece achieves something very rare in its genre. This isn’t something that I felt all along, but as I’ve examined why I continue to love One Piece, it’s a theory that I think helps to explain it. Shounen series in general place a heavy emphasis on fighting. It defines the genre. Of course, there are reasons the characters fight, and those reasons can often result in long expositions and flashbacks (in the middle of fights, unfortunately). One Piece is no different. How One Piece is different is that the fighting is truly a means to an end, not because you know it should be, but because it really is (with many other series, the fighting is usually why we’re watching, whatever else the story might say). Often, the aftermath and outcomes of the fights are far more rewarding and what one looks forward to, rather than the fights themselves. A subtle difference, but it makes all the difference in setting One Piece apart from most shounen series. One Piece is at its most heartwarming in the aftermath of the battles, and in exploring its characters. It is most enjoyable when it focuses on the antics of the characters as they explore the places they go and generally get themselves into situations. The interactions between the crew members have spawned tons of hilarious exchanges and scenarios, many which are simply priceless. One Piece’s main characters, the Straw Hat pirates, are molded after common cliches, yet, as with better stories, make those cliches their own and find a way to be quirkier. The characters, one and all, can be unabashedly silly yet transition convincingly to deadly serious. No transition is greater than with Luffy, the main character. Although he appears goofy and simple, his attitude is better described as fun-loving and child-like, with an innate fascination of the world, new things, and exploration. He isn’t dumb; rather he ignores typical adult concerns and conventions because they just don’t interest him. Yet we understand what matters to him. So when those things are threatened, his seriousness is wholly believable, even if it’s in direct contrast with his usual demeanor. And when he is serious, he can only be described as incredibly cool ^_^ Remarkably, One Piece manages to balance a genuine lightheartedness through its humor and exuberance, with the gravity of the battles and hardships. That lightheartedness is missing from most shounen series. Other series have humor but there is joy in One Piece, which is apparently more difficult to create. Not to say that this necessarily makes a good story, but it is unique and I’ve seldom encountered other shounen series that exude the same fun and silliness, even as it packs on fights, special powers, and bigger and badder enemies. I should note that One Piece lacks some of what I consider to be vital elements of a good story, most notably character development and growth, and real tension (i.e., death is possible). I’ll skip the last, since most series aren’t going to kill off their main characters, but I've not missed the other things, yet. First and foremost, One Piece is a lot of fun. It's a story that inspires imagination, and a desire to explore and see new things. It consistently makes me smile. And while real tension may be lacking, it doesn't lack for touching or heartbreaking storylines. One Piece is an amazing ride. Not for everyone, perhaps, but if themes of friendship, dreams, and exploration, wrapped in a fun package not afraid to be silly, with a healthy dash of fighting, appeals to you, what are you waiting for?",10,Recommended,"May 11, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f5743c296c,2,5279
"One Piece, is truly one of my favourite Anime and Manga. Although, in the beggining it took me some time to warm up to it. Story The first part of the series begins by introducing each character as they join the main crew. It didn't really seem that interesting to me at first, but since a friend of mine was watching it with me I decided to continue it. After the beggining of the Arabasta Arc I began to love the series more and more after every Arc. The mixture of Action, Adventure, Comedy, Politics are all given in a smooth and enjoyable pace. Also, the story gives the viewers some important messages concerning friendship and how people should not give up on what they believe. Art The art is really good for a long running series, especially after the High Definition enhancement. It might seem pretty different in the beginning after adapting from Oda Eiichiro-san's art from the manga. I'm not saying it's perfect but it truly is interesting. Sound The Openings and Endings used in the show can sometimes become addictive, you might find yourself in the middle of the road humming the new Opening theme (At least I do some times :P). The background music is also fitting for the series adding some new tracks in later episodes but I don't think they're anything special. Characters The one thing that makes One Piece one of the top series are the characters. Each and every one of them has a different personality both funny and serious and all with a tearjerking past. Furthermore, all of them get equal attention and spotlight. Enjoyment As I said before, the more I continue the series the more I enjoy it. It's really continuing on at a good pace, exploring different genres (e.x. The Thriller Bark Arc) Overall, One Piece has been entertaining from every aspect. From it's hilarious comedy to it's Epic battles. If you have time or are interested in watching a long running series (and I'm sure it has a lot more to go) them don't hesitate to begin watching One Piece, you won't regret it!!",10,Recommended,"Oct 28, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b25ba34b3c,2,2006
"Short review: For me, this anime was the greatest anime to ever exist for the first ~500 episodes (which is impressively long by almost any standard) but then after that, the anime began to steadily worsen over time. I'm going to portion my experience into three main parts: pre-time skip, post-time skip, and my overall general view. Long review: - Pre-time skip: When I first got into OP, I instantly fell in love with it for many reasons. I'll name the big main ones. First, the atmosphere and theme of anime was unique; the idea of sailing the seas to find different unique islands, finding exciting new things, and the variety of different devil fruit powers and bosses are all well constructed it felt like the anime had it all when it comes to overall theme: it's new, it's intriguing, and it's exciting especially for the first time you experience it. Second, the side characters in the straw hats were not very complex or advanced but they were very unique in their own way and likable (probably other than Usopp), each had an interesting backstory and dream, each said something interesting from time to time that was more than some overused gag, and most importantly (this is very important) they actually felt like they actively existed and were adding to the storyline while still peaking my interest. Third, I was so excited about so many things including the the other straw hats: I had so many exciting questions unanswered and my expectation would be that they would be answered soon enough (guess what? they weren't). Fourth, a lot of events just made me cry buckets. I rarely get emotional when watching anything really. I think making the viewer emotional over a show isn't easy to do since being emotional means that the narrator successfully made a good story with good elements and characters that one can get emotionally invested in along with a really good production team that can recreate those events very well. There were no cons in the pre-time skip that are worth mentioning other than some scenes feeling unnecessarily stretched out and Kaku being the worst gag of a villain ever (seriously? a giraffe with a nose for a sword?). - Post-time skip: My love/hate relationship begins here. At first it was all love, to me this was the greatest piece of fiction to ever be created but now, not so much. The novelty of a lot of concepts within the show such as the devil fruits, the crazy ideas of islands, and so on begins to wear off after the time-skip. Post-time skip, you start to notice that Oda has this script that he repeats in almost every single arc involving the straw hats; this script isn't really an issue when you first experience it but after a few times it just gets incredibly boring and predictable. What really pisses me off is that we are almost towards the end and Oda is still using the script again in egghead. The script is basically: 1- Luffy arrives at Z island 2- Luffy meets some main X friend in Z island 3- X friend is in trouble 4- Luffy helps X friend which involves miraculously beating bad guy(s) along the way which saves X's kingdom/island (usually a scene here where you're supposed to cry happens). This happens almost every single arc and it gets so damn boring to see after a while. I can already see this pattern happening with Egghead. Oda tries to spice the script up but it's more or less the same. This script is a very lazy and boring way of writing up a story that had many elements of success. The script also makes those emotional scenes I talked about incredibly less effective since you can predict what will happen very easily from early on. Remember how I was talking about the straw hats? Well, here these characters are incredibly dumbed down to one-liners (haha usopp has that funny scaredy cat disease! or haha Nico robin back at it again with a sad joke or haha zoro lost his away again ROFL). Instead of further developing the other straw hats, Oda is not only dumbing them down now but also making them incredibly less involved in any thing significant. Oda tries to undo this by sometimes having them involved in incredibly short-lived pointless subplots but it just comes out to be lame. Spoilers being in the show's opening is so frustrating. I do not read the manga, why am I being told of so many major events going on? I do not want to know all these spoilers; can I just skip the opening of the show? Sure and I have done that but I shouldn't have to worry about finding out there's a new crew member before they actually join from the opening OF THE DAMN SHOW, I shouldn't have to worry about finding out where X missing person's whereabouts are from the opening when they haven't found them yet, and so much other stuff. The story has been moving at an incredibly slow pace that the One Piece treasure hunt seems like a lost subplot: when other shows take years showing significant progress towards a character's goal(s), with one piece it is years ON THE SAME ISLAND with almost zero progress. I have reached a point where it does not matter whether the one piece treasure is is a bunch of gold on some random island, a bomb equal to 100000 nukes, or some secret majestic powers, the excitement just isn't there because it has been unaddressed for hundreds of episodes. Now that I'm thinking about it, this is a crappy thing Oda loves to do: he will tease you really hard with a supposedly HUGE unknown/possible thing within the story and either never deliver the answer or just take so long that you start to lose interest. My interpretation is that the author does this to maintain interest throughout the series but actually after a while it just gets annoying since it is sooooo overdone. One of the worst downgrades about the post-time skip is the introduction of haki within fights. My number one issue with it is that it made arguably the strongest type of devil fruits seem like a joke since haki renders it almost useless along with significantly weakening the other types of devil fruits as well. In summary, the introduction of haki is more of an overhaul of the both the power scale and battle system within the anime rather than an addition since haki is basically either just strength or some other busted type of haki that only a select few have. Pre-time skip fights were more fun and entertaining as fights involved some strategy or some expectation of how the fight might look like before it begins (I.e a logia vs a paramecia is not the same as a logia vs logia). However, now with haki it leaves fights way less interesting since more haki can demolish just about anyone, if you have enough of it, in the most boring way possible. - Overall thoughts and general view: The show feels completely different than what it started as in a bad way. What started off as a pirate crew's adventure towards an exciting unknown treasure moved towards a god-like superhero show where the MC is just saving everyone all the time. Normally, shows can have more than one plot(s) but moving the whole idea of Luffy from a pirate who wants to capture the great treasure into some God-like savior WHILE JUST BARELY moving forward the first plot in any meaningful manner seems like a terrible idea. Another thing is Luffy has to be one of the worst main characters of all time. His personality consists of shouting, being reckless, eating an OP devil fruit, and every other very basic main character (loves his friends crew, adventurous, honorable etc..). What do we actually know about luffy? Very little. Has luffy changed at all as a main character during 1000+ episodes? No. Has his experiences changed him in any way? No. We don't even know his ""real"" motive and dream related to wanting to be the pirate king. For me, generally speaking, the pre-time skip alone carries the overwhelming majority of my rating points. All the recent arcs along with all the post-time skip content is very underwhelming, repetitive, and simply put: a snooze fest. The post-time skip part of this anime makes it enough to not recommend anyone getting caught up in a show that starts off excellent but screws up everything as it gets closer towards the end.",7,Not Recommended,"Aug 14, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f70bbbeb0,2,8140
"The story is quite decent and voice acting is also. This deserves 7/8, but some of the fandom is so trash like they adulates toei so much that some of them even say One piece's pacing isn't a problem. So, it fueled my mind and not giving it more than a 4. I request all of you to read the manga or wait for the remake to be released. Toei just butchered the series with insane slow pacing and below average animation quality. We live in a world where AOT adapts 33 volumes into 94 episodes and One Piece adapts 33 volumes into 300+ episodes 😭, man just accept it's pacing problem isn't just minor, it's huge.

"Story: The story is awesome, the best ever made probably. Eiichiro Oda (the mangaka) is a genius of all geniuses, he come up with all this awesome stuff and make an amazing story! Art: The animation is not very good to begin with, but it is become better afterwards. But what could you expect, the first episodes is old! But the animation now is amazing, especielly if you use Vegapunks HD HQ version! Sound: One Piece have an amazing soundtrack that is working out very nicely with whats happening at the moment it is played. One of the best OST ever if you ask me. Character: Can't come up with another show with so good characters as there is in One Piece. They're all amazing, funny and you kind of get to know them yourself. Enjoyment: The enjoyment is on top everytime you watch a One Piece episode. You're sitting there, watching amazing fights, funny crazyness (mostly by Luffy, Usopp and a little from Chopper). You see very good friendship and some touching scenes. On top of this you got amazing animation, soundtrack and the best story ever made. Overall: Really don't know what to write here, other than that this show is the best ever made in my opinion. If you think it is a bit too long you should just try some episodes or one of the movies, after that you can't go back and you end up watching all the episodes!

"At first I was a bit skeptical to watch this but once I got more and more into the story I just couldn't stop watching. Sure there is a ton of episodes but I find it well worth it to watch it all. The concept behind the whole story is very emotional. I felt every possible emotion the characters portrayed in One Piece. I even laughed so hard and shed a few tears.

"Well I thought it was a good idea for me to wright a review for my favorite anime and seeing as how I am a major fan of it I might over rate it but I will try to control this. :D Story: The story is about a boy named Monkey D Luffy he wants to become the greatest pirate and claim the title King of The Pirates. Now I will be honist here the first couple of episodes are not nearly as good as they are now, but hey he gets better soon. The story dosent pick up till Luffy gets four other crew members and the Fifth story arc (they are short atfirst). The fifth story is what made me love Op it has everything a person could want, humor, action, plot, emotion. Then after this point in the series it just gets better and is why it is one of the top anime/manga\'s of this day and age. Animation: The animation is a little differnt. I guess you could say it kinda looks like its a cartoon/anime and the characters can look kinda goofy sometimes but it does fit the setting of the show. I gave it a 8 even though I love how it looks. Sound: OMG some of the best music ever it is amazing. The sound tracks to OP is outstanding, that is the only way to describe it. (why they took it out of the english version and replaced it with rap still makes me wonder) Enjoyment: There is only a few other things that I enjoy more that watching OP. Including every above plus it has very good movies and fillers. I will actualy watch One Piece\'s fillers and enjoy them, thats how good they are. Overall: I would say check out this anime no matter what.",10,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2007",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_874fc2e499,2,1538
"Instead of giving the anime a ten simply because it's One Piece, let's take a step back and look at this anime from an objective stand point. The characters and the story is amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites, but wow. Those are the only redeeming qualities about it and all of it comes from the mangaka. Let's start with the things that make this adaption garbage compared to the manga that cannot be argued. The pacing. I have no idea when it was, but at about the middle of the pre-timeskip, Toei decided it was a good idea to adapt a chapter an episode leaving some arcs almost completely unwatchable - full of scenes that drag on continuously and fillers that weren't originally in the manga. This is most apparent during the dressrosa arc, which has been a little slow in the manga, but is still pretty good, but is nearly unwatchable because of the pacing issues. The animation and the art. Do I really have to say anything about this? Anyone who's watched One Piece extensively knows just how garbage it is, but will continue to watch it anyway because it's One Piece (me being one of those people) and that is why Toei will keep doing what they're doing with the anime. http://oen-peice.tumblr.com/ Go through there and tell me that I'm wrong about this. This anime is not a proper adaptation for the manga and the only proper way to experience it is through the manga. It was somewhat good in the beginning, but become nearly unwatchable as you get to the later arcs. There is nothing I can really subjectively complain about except for maybe the lack of death and how subpar the timeskip has been compared to pre-timeskip.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 13, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_95f933c0c1,2,1652

"""It has 700++ episodes"" ""This show is for kids"" ""This show sucks"" ETC *Contains heavy spoiler* Are what most people who don't watch One Piece would say. This is because they are just simply overwhelmed by the number of episodes. There are also people who claimed to have watch the show but it still sucks, so I asked a simple question what was their impression on Nami's backstory and they were unable to answer which is a solid proof that they didn't even watch more than 25 episodes. Three years ago, I was a hater of this series but after I saw the manga sales list, I was surprised to see that the manga sale is so overwhelming so I decided to start watching it and now I am here. One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy and his companions, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky and Brook travelling the whole world in order to achieve their own dreams. Story 10/10 The story started with an epic entrance. I have never seen any character enter the scene which such way. At first, it made people think that Coby was the main character because he was heavily focused on, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy just suddenly came out of it while shouting ""that was a nice nap!"", I was stunned because it was hilarious yet a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different island had different uniqueness! Oda is very creative! It's fun to see they are travelling around, discovering mysteries. Talking about mysteries, One Piece has this ""Void Century"" mysteries which is that 800 years ago, there were a period of 100 years where there were simply no record and the government stopped people from finding the full history. They would go to the point of eliminating every single innocent citizen just because of knowing this history. The only for someone to know the Void Century, one must know how to read Poneglyph. Robin was the last person to be able to read the Poneglyph and she was being chased for 20 years ever since she was an eight year old girl. One Piece consisted many tearjerking moments. E.g Bellemere's death, Doctor Hiluluk's death, story about Montblanc Cricket, Going Merry's final moment, Ace's death, Whitebeard's death, Corazon's death. Animation 1/10 Toei is lazy as fuck Sound 10/10 I don't really care about sound but One Piece has some good OSTs. Character 10/10 -Character development- The first character development started with Coby. He was a coward, but after he saw Luffy's determination, Coby fought his own cowardice and tried to achieve his own dream. The second character development was Zoro. He was not afraid of dying when he faced off the world's strongest swordsman. Zoro later acknowledged that he was a weakling thus he strove on becoming stronger. The third character development was Usopp. Despite he he himself knew that Kaya knew he was lying, he still lied to Kaya in order for her to relieve her boredom due to Kaya's condition that she couldn't live her life freely, Usopp started lying because of his late mother. He tried to cheer his mother by shouting ""pirates are coming"" because his dad, Yassop was a pirate. The fourth character development was Nami. It was revealed that her past was so sad. When she was ten, her step mother, Bellemere, was murdered right in front of her eyes. It was due to that Bellemere didn't have any money to pay to the pirates who invaded their hometown. Bellemere, despite having the chance to just say she lived alone in the house, chose to admit that she had daughter because of her believe that she would never say she didn't have a family. This showed that Bellemere rather die than to disowned her stepdaughters. The story didn't end there, Nami, being a genius girl who was able to draw a perfect map despite being a ten year old girl was forced to work for the pirate that killed her mother figure. The pirate wanted her talent. They made a deal that if she can pay him 1 million Beli (1 million Yen = 8135 USD) they would leave the village. For eight years, Nami stored up to 700 K like Arlong's slave. But Arlong betrayed her. I can go on but these are some proofs to show that One Piece does have lots of character developments. Enjoyment 10/10 With a good and entertaining storyline, of course the enjoyment will be there. Overall 10/10",10,Recommended,"Nov 30, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1bb8cb0e6e,3,4368
"One Piece is the most over hyped piece of trash i have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Below are some, but not all, (as there are too many for a simple review) of my biggest issues with this horrendous work of fiction. Female Character designs: When asked about his process for drawing female characters, Oda wrote "" Yes. Hello. It's drawing time at the SBS segment. I would suggest that you think of a woman's proportions as ""three circles, one X"". Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be leaving."" This is a great start because it shows what his female characters main roles are in the story; to be fan service. It's no secret that after the timeskip, Nami and Robin (who were both already done with puberty) somehow went through puberty again and grew huge breast. I don't personally have an issue with any of his female character designs but how is this any different than Fairy Tail or Bleach sexulaizing its female cast members? Nami and her dream: Nami's dream is to draw a map of the world. You'd think Oda would have a panel of her drawing a map at the end of each arc to show us that she's actively fulfilling her dream but you'd be wrong. The whole point of her traveling with the Strawhats is to help her friends achieve their goals and to achieve her own. So, instead of showing Nami actively achieving her goals, Oda simply writes about it in an SBS ""Of course she is. Her routine every day is to draw maps after dinner. As the story progresses during the day, she has to give sailing instructions as the navigator, so there's a lot she has to do out on the deck."" All we need is one tiny tiny panel at the end of each arc showing Nami adding Islands and locations to her map but her dreams don't matter. Zoro's goal of becoming the greatest swordsman: The way you become the best swordsman in the OP world is to do what Mihawk does and travel around the world fighting swordsmen. Zoro has rarely fought any swordsmen post time skip; he had a little skirmish with Fujitora, he had a fight with killer who's kind of a swordsmen, he ""fought"" Hyouzou and that's about it. We were shown how you become the world's greatest swordsmen through Mihawk yet Zoro never has actual, life and death sword duels with swordsmen anymore. How can I take him wanting to become the best at his craft serious when he never challenges others who are on a similar level or stronger than he is at said craft? Even in Wano, a land filled to the brim with samurai, Zoro never actually fights any of them. If I'm leaving out any fights Zoro has has had with any actual swordsmen post time skip, please let me know in the comment section. Chopper is a mascot now: Chopper has always been cute but would transform into a more serious form when using his transformations. Now, Chopper is just cute. Even his transformations are just adorable. The pre timeskip joke was the world government treating him as the Strawhats pet but now he actually feels like the Strawhats pet. His original personality has been replaced with a cute, cuddly, ""kawaii"" persona. Oda also doesn't really focus on his dream of curing every sickness in the world, he simply gives him people to treat each arc which is better than some of the other SH's. It'd be nice if we saw Chopper in his lab each arc working on actual medicine that can cure all illnesses but we never do. Usopp repeats character development each arc: Usopp's character development each arc is the same. He's afraid of going to an island, he gets into dangerous situations on said Island, he pussies out, he commits an act of bravery then he repeats this process in the next arc. Are we still supposed to believe Usopp is a coward at this point? He stood up against the world government, he regularly fights enemies many times stronger than he is, he trained on a dangerous Island for two years and he travels with notorious pirates on a daily basis. I get the irony of it but it's still redundant which is another issue with the story as a whole. Recycled plots: Almost every arc has the same structure. Luffy and crew goes to an Island, that Island's residents are oppressed by a king or ruler (Kaido, Doflamingo, Arlong, Crocodile, Big Mom, Enel, etc), Luffy vows to take down the big bad, Luffy fights the big bad and loses, Luffy gets separated from the crew, the crew has their fights with the Big Bad's minions, Luffy comes back into the story then ultimately defeats the big bad or at least wins a victory somehow. Very few arcs go outside of this general formula and it becomes repetitive after 900 chapters. P.S. I could talk about how Sanji is basically a gag character at this point, how Whitebeard not reaching out to Oden makes no sense, how Robin truly is just fanservice who occasional reads poneglyphs, how Oda has a habit of ""killing"" characters then bringing them back to life which is bad writing, how Big Mom is a meme or how Kozuki Toki's whole character was pointless but It'd take me forever to detail each issue. The point of my original post was to ask the question ""why can every other shonen be criticised but not One Piece""? There's tons of videos and posts criticising dragon ball, Bleach, Black Clover and Naruto. There's tons of posts on this sub criticising hxh and My Hero Academia for example but One Piece seems to be off limits for some reason. Is One piece just perfectly written so every criticism of it is invalid or is the One Piece fandom incapable of accepting criticism.",3,Not Recommended,"Jul 8, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_381641e462,3,5450
"Story For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. Animation Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. Music Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). Characters Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. Overall Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time whereOne Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.",8,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eadd5f72cc,3,8442
"The spiritual succesor to Dragon Ball (the original series), One Piece combines unforgettable cartoon visuals with knokout fight scenes and an epic plot Akira Toriyama never aspired to. In a fantastic world of vast seas, teenage Monkey D. Luffy-possibly the most cheerfully stubborn shonen anime caracter ever-yearns to raise a crew, become the King of the Pirates, and find One Piece, a legendary lost treasure. His special ability is the power to stretch like rubber, used mostly to beat up opponents, his special weakness is that, thanks to the same magic fruit that gave him strechy powers,he can never swim. the art gradually growing more detailed as the series gose on. The plot is set up like an RPG, as Luffy and his companions sail into a new area, become involved in the local troubles, fight the bad guys, and move on. Within this rough formula, however, grand plot threads are laid, and with each episode the world of One Piece becomes richer and more glorious: a tall-tale world of sea monsters, faraway kingdoms, cloud island, and superpowered pirates of every shape, size, and description. The mood is sheer over the top melodrama, every line is weeping, laughing, or shouting said with enough winking humor to be enjoyed by jaded hipsters as well as kids. The series is notable for its incredibly bloody and intense fight scenes in wich, however no one ever dies. I have seen the series two times: in englis,German and Japanese and strongly recomande it !!!",10,Recommended,"Sep 25, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_30a1fa3463,3,1473
"Considered by some to be the heir to the throne of Dragon Ball in terms of Japanese market penetration, One Piece is certainly a phenomenon. The manga's print run recently outpaced Dragon Ball and the series, at more than 130 episodes, is still going strong. It's easy to see why; One Piece follows a very simple and very successful shonen action formula. It worked in the past for Rurouni Kenshin and Dragon Ball and it's working wonderfully for One Piece. The premise is pretty basic. Luffy D. Monkey, an irrepressible youth, ate the Devil's Fruit, which gave his body extra-strength elasticity. He's searching for the One Piece, a legendary treasure that will make him the King of all Pirates and finally allow him to prove himself to his childhood idol, a selfless pirate by the name of Shanks. Along the way, he collects an army of somewhat freakish rogues, including a tough swordfighter named Zoro who fights with a sword in his mouth, and Nami, a spunky thief. Together they have wacky adventures, beat up the bad guys, and collect treasure. It all sounds pretty harmless, right? Well, right, it is. One Piece is completely harmless entertainment. The battles can be surprisingly brutal at times, but overall, this is pure shonen action entertainment. It is entirely unpretentious and knows exactly what it wants to be, and excels at that. That having been said, One Piece is not a particularly deep show, although the characters are well developed. The focus seems to be on the crazy villains and the endless string of fights the main characters go through. Luffy and his crew of misfits go from town to town, saving the repressed masses and eliminating evil pirates who stand between them and the One Piece. In some ways, it's very reminiscent of Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin and Luffy are both laid-back badasses with hearts of gold that surround themselves with surprisingly capable outcasts and defeat circus freak-style enemies in episode after episode. If you like that sort of thing, One Piece delivers. If you don't, One Piece is going to bore the faith out of you. So, for fans of formulaic action shows, One Piece is a well-animated bit of fluff that sports decent music and some well-done action scenes. Unfortunately, the bizarre character designs are sure to turn a lot of folks off. One Piece is not done in a traditional anime style. It's very unique and it's bound to rub some people the wrong way. Otherwise, if you like your anime rife with fight scenes that last several episodes, declaratory statements (“Ore wa Kaizokuo ni naru da!” or “I will become the Pirate King!” is Luffy's favorite thing to say...), screwball humor and a touch of originality, One Piece will not fail to please.",10,Recommended,"Jun 13, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eee156647d,3,2711
"As Hayao Miyazaki said, ""characters who never change are not interesting."" One Piece since the beginning of the timeskip has been a good example of that. For a while it was a flawed but phenomenal adventure that delighted partially by being unpredictable, while building dramatic momentum, the bonds of friendship, crafting a beautiful paradox of dark and goofy in its universe and making it credible enough that a five -year old minded spoiled brat would be capable of becoming the king of the high seas. Luffy is kind of the Tom Cruise of anime characters. He is small but he seems bigger because he is capable of specatular stunts, he has a trememnous s**t eating grin which was cute (for a while) and he is a little naive. And he has a great crew. They are the kind of characters you fall in love with, but falling in love is always a superficial experience. When you stand back you realize that they are all stereotypes; the coward, the alcoholic, the womanizer, the hunk, the perverted grandpa. The only character that resembles a real human being is Robin, who is so silently compelling that she should have been the start of the series. The crew go their separate ways for two years after about 500 episodes. Luffy hides away on an Island to train with a sensei in the art of Haki, much like Luke learns the force from yoda. Unfortunately he gains all of the action figure benefits of the training but none of the wisdom. Right from the moment Luffy reunites with his crew, not as a commanding captain, but like a little brother who is seeing his older brothers and sisters, the ship called ONE PIECE was sinking. The universe has gotten too big for Luffy to NOT grow up. His immature tendencies are no longer entertaining. Rather than make him a character, Oda is content to leave him as a formula: he is tacky during funny scenes and aggressive and supposedly sincere during action scenes. That sincerity feels phoney now, simply because it is not in the nature of the person that Luffy is. It is as phoney as Donald Trump's ridiculous promises to America, painting an illusion of a utopia. A show about a candidate for a pirate king needs a strong character for a protagonist, not a sketch of a kid. Now this wouldn't be a problem if the show were purely comedy, but no it also want to be a heavy drama at times too, and Oda's ambitions have gone beyond his ability to write them well. As a drama, The tonal shifts are so inconsistent. Sometimes it is played as farce, and sometimes it is played more sincerely. More often than not though, the darker subplots involving themes like genocide are done very two dimensionally, and they tend to serve messages that are very glib and lead to backwards minded sequences. Robin (for example) is an adult from a dramatic world who becomes a disney-derivative damsel in distress at one point, and her prince charming are kids from a comedic one. This is just one of many examples of Oda destroying the integrity of his characters by being too condescending of them. He makes the mistake of thinking that in order to make a character sympathetic he has to make them seem childlike in innocence. such is the case with characters like Luffy's brother Ace, who goes from a bad ass to a crybaby. Indeed some of Oda's philosophy is a complete insult to our intelligence, No subtly at all, and the emotional scenes are always breastfed to us. The Devil fruit concept was cute at first, but now it's just silly, like an idea stolen from a video game. There are too many fruits, yielding too many powers and likewise, there are too many characters in the universe. Some of them, in fact most of them have become far more interesting than Luffy, and his pals at this point. Since the timeskip, the Strawhat pirates have become increasingly less compelling and intimidating, and are now a bunch of pansies in silly costumes. We don't really see an increase in their straight because the antagonists are always two steps ahead of them in strength, when they should be more like 1 step ahead. As a result the fights all feel like recycled sequences. One Piece is a show that has gone on too long and yet disputed the distance we have travelled, it feels like we have gone nowhere.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_883f0e2015,3,4219
"The perfect example of Quantity over Quality, both in characters, arcs, episodes, everything. Being a part of the big 3, and considering it's popularity and rating, it was to expect better, instead it is just a (long) waste of time. Under a promise of ""it gets better"", I watched 500+ episodes and it never did. As much popular as the show is, it tries to milk as much of the property as possible, and it shows how strict the schedule of publishing manga is considering how bad it is. Characters: Over the million characters it has, focusing on the main crew, they all give the illusion of being good characters considering the eternity you have with them, but they just have a typical sad backstory, and remain pretty 1 dimensional throughout the rest (the female ones being used just for sex appeal) growing only on power level and fighting abilities. The rest of the characters are as good as their designs: appalling and ugly, which is expected considering there's a million of them. Main Character: Receives it's own category by how terrible it is, the show treats him being a jerk to others for no reason as a joke, his humor is being vulgar, and there is no stakes to his elastic plot armor. He has terrible morals that only benefit him, and forces them into others by screaming, shouting, or punching while screaming louder. It makes a truly obnoxious character hard to root for, even when sometimes bad happens, not to him, but to others he cares about, there is no compansion felt since he also has no compasion for others. None of his fights were enjoyable for that. Story: What is does well is World Building, since it's expected considering how many episodes they have for that. Every arc has it's own location with it's own rules, which should be a positive point, however the payoff at the end of each arc is non-existent, it always ends in a easy battle to the plot-armor of the MC, or plot-convinience occurence whenever the situation gets rough. The loop is getting 40 or 50 episodes dedicated for build-up and antecipation to always end in a lousy and predictable way, and hope the next arc to be better (which it never is). The milking on the series is so bad that, besides having fillers (which are unwatchably bad), it also has entire arcs disguised as fillers which contribute nothing to the overall plot, streching it as much as possible. Animation: Cut all the corners, re-used animations, recaps, some seasons with 3 minute openings, we have 1000+ episodes and not more of 10 mins of quality. Fanbase: It gets the award of being the worst in all anime community, considering they have to dedicate so much of their times on this anime alone, it is all they can talk about, and trash on every other anime that gets popular, they have a mentality that only allows them to like 1piece and hate on everything else. In conclusion: There is no reason to watch this besides knowing how NOT to do storytelling, besides world building there is nothing of value here, it is a good thing that its sheer amount of episodes discourages people from watching it to watch better shows instead.",1,Not Recommended,"Feb 2, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7545d1c3ff,3,3102
"One Piece is superb in MANY ways. The quality of both storyline, and production for this series was leaps and bounds over almost any other. Although I admit the artwork for a long stride of the series was only adequate, the epic storyline full of ambition, unique and enjoyable fight scenes, and a display of some of the most unique and down right amazing characters keeps this Anime at the top of the charts. The depth of the plot really only grows throughout the series, and the fact that you only get more interested as time goes on just goes to show how they've managed to last 408 episodes thus far(with many more to go). Their are two other great aspects to this, and many of my other favorite Anime, that should be touched on. The power-scale of One Piece is by far one of the most balanced and in check I've ever seen. Each character displays his or her own powers or unique abilities/traits without the sense of repetition. The second ""great aspect"" to the series is the party-up fashion the story takes. I personally LOVE when an Anime starts with a main character and as the events unfold they establish connections with others and for one reason or another unite. One Piece IMO has encompassed this in their storyline better than any other Anime. However other examples include Yuu Yuu Hakusho, and Rurouni Kenshin. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is the dubbed version. In Summation, for those of you that don't mind subtitles One Piece is a top notch Anime that shows great fight scenes, in depth characters, and a plot that will keep you marking your calendars for the release date of the next episode.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b1da43b5cb,3,1639
"I used to fall into the trap of &quot;The 4Kids dub = One Piece&quot;, so I figured One Piece was some totally lame series that only appealed to little kids. I actually got into One Piece after visiting a crack community on LiveJournal (capslock_op). I decided to check it out, but I was hesitant. Then, I ended up reading volumes 1-14 in under a month! (I know I'm reviewing the anime, but I read the manga first.) One Piece has very believable characters. The main crew members all have very real, very believable personalities. The storyline is interesting and easy to follow--hardly anything ever goes unexplained, so there are no loose ends or awkward plot holes (which is a problem I encountered with Bleach.) It has a great balance of humorous and serious moments. A lot of people seem to complain about the art style being &quot;bad&quot;, but I don't think that's the case. I think that One Piece's art style is appropriate for the mood and style of the series itself. It's entertaining and a little bit goofy. If One Piece's art style were &quot;better&quot;, it wouldn't be the same. Sure, sometimes there are some really oddly drawn frames, but the bulk of the animation is pretty good.

"The One Piece anime is a lot like Berserk (2016), yeah it looks terrible, and is badly animated, but it's still One Piece. I've been watching this loveable train wreck for almost twenty years, and I have to admit, I don't understand people who decide to watch this now that it's over 1000 episodes in. It takes 17 uninterrupted days to watch this, who has the time? Toei may be the bain of my ability to watch anime. Slam Dunk and Dragonball, both are great manga with terrible adaptions. One Piece is a pretty good manga with an even worse adaption then the aforementioned Toei disappointments. And what are the shared issues between all three, that cause them to be poor adaptions? The horrible weekly schedule, which leads to poor direction, bad pacing and terrible production values. Arcs get dragged out for ludicrous amounts of time, deflating the tension week by week as we wait for something to happen. Story: it's One Piece, it's looney tunes lord of the rings for kids and their families. I'm generally fond of the story, I mean I haven't stopped watching it yet. Characters: due to its length, One Piece characters do tend to feel very static, but they're charming enough to usually get you through whatever meandering plot thread is being covered in the episode you're watching (and the subsequent 20 that plot will run through). Themes: don't trust the government kids, treasure your friends and help out when you can. Good simple themes to teach kids and remind adults about. Animation: AHAHAHAHAHA.....it varies wildly, arc to arc, episode to episode... shot to shot..... Overall, it's pretty bad. Music: It's an anime by toei, you're going to hear the same 5 pieces of incidental music so many times that they will be permanently etched into your brain. Pacing: Luffy fought Kaido on the roof on Onigashima for over a year....... as a child, I thought those five minutes it took Namek to explode felt like forever, but that was only five episodes. Why is toei doing this to us? (So that TV tokyo's ad revenue isn't devalued during One Piece's time slot) In the end, do I think One Piece is worth it? I guess, if you've been watching it for decades, or if you want to share it with your particularly patient offspring. But it feels like a cheap product, made to broaden the reach of One Piece's market saturation, allowing the production committee to make even more money.And that just feels hollow. I'm looking forward to the remake, hopefully it addresses my issues and let's people who are intimidated by the length try out the series.

"I created an account just so that I could write this review. I started watching One Piece four or five years ago, and still find myself moved by this amazing series. I have seen and enjoyed many anime, from Gintama, to Death Note, to Legend of Galactic Heroes, to Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, a plethora of Gundams, and many others. One Piece has something that none of them have. In fact, One Piece has something that perhaps no other form of motion picture entertainment today has: rock-solid, consistently good writing. Good writing is hard to find, but good writing that can stay consistent and true to a massive overarching storyline through 500+ episodes? At first glance, One Piece presents itself as superficial, formulaic, light-hearted fun, but then it catches you off-guard with its depth of character, its surprising plot twists, its amazingly complicated and well-developed world, and its wisdom into the desires of the human heart. It lulls you into thinking you've figured it out, and then surprises you yet again. Plot threads left dangling for hundreds of episodes suddenly become significant again and seamlessly weave themselves back into the storyline, and you realize that you are viewing a grandly designed epic that is genuinely designed to span years. I have seen far too many shows that start off great, and then reach a point where the author or writers start floundering around and basically start just making the plot up as they go along. *Cough*Cough*Bleach*Cough*Naruto*Cough*LOST,DEAR GOD LOST*Cough. Not so with One Piece. Every story arc fits into place in a larger tapestry of the main plotline, and does so in some amazingly imaginative ways. In terms of artwork, One Piece certainly can be strange, but overall it contains some of the most original and fantastic locations and character designs you will ever see, anywhere. In terms of animation, it does occasionally suffer from the fluctuating quality levels that most long-running series have. The pacing is good, in general, although there are a few times where it feels like certain events are dragged out a bit longer than necessary, although it never reaches Dragonball Z-like proportions. Many of the of the arcs feel like they slow down right before the big conclusion, but in a way this only heightens the emotion at the conclusion of each arc. And believe me, every arc has a powerful climax. The music is fantastic, although noticeably repeated. It's difficult to have original music for 500 episodes, after all, and it's only to be expected. Many of the tunes are very catchy, though, and I love how main characters are associated with particular themes in true Wagnerian fashion. The characters are the best part of the show, and I would rate this anime higher than 10 for character if possible. They are all fantastically written, both amusing and bad-ass, and tremendously consistent in personality. The Japanese voice acting for them is also utterly perfect, and while I admit some other anime dubs are decent, I highly recommend watching this one in the original language. One Piece never fails to move me emotionally, and always in a positive way, leaving me feeling better about life in general. Paraphrasing something Luffy said once, ""As long as you are alive, something good can happen to you."" I started watching this show with my friends years ago, and I will treasure that time spent, both as a reminder of some good times I shared, and because One Piece is simply an amazing journey. - Happy Sailing",10,Recommended,"Jun 4, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cd3c7787fd,3,3549
"Hands down, the best anime I have ever seen! Story is about a boy, Monkey D. Luffy who is aiming to become the Pirate king. On his way there he will need to conquer the sea, and meet up many new friends and ofc - Nakama. The everything is okay at first, but as anime progresses, story grows up to amazing proportions! I don't want to spoil all the great fun you could enjoy by watching it so i'l just give a few rates. Story: 9 - Pretty simple thing grows into something much wider and interesting, deserves the grade rightfully Sound: 9 - Great sound effects displayed through the series, even has few of it own songs (for instance ""Bink's sake"", really great one), and great sound effects. Characters: pure 10 - The crew meet up a whole bunch of characters, that are again - unique. I think that One piece has the richest line up of characters of all animes i watched,heard about or will watch in the future. And again nearly all of them played or will play, big or small role in the series. Enjoyment - Pure 10, as somewhat fan of anime, and BIG fan of pirates, I would personally give it 30/10, but that grade isn't available :D Even the ones that aren't necesserily fans of pirates/pirate era, will again like this series in some other way, because its simply flawless! Overall - Pure 10/10! P.S. As someone who experienced it, as well as many of other people as I heard, I must say from critic view that old ""4kids"" english dub did a pretty lousy job, poor voice acting and a lot of erased stuff. I almost dropped the series on episode 2 because of it. Back then I strictly watched DUBBED series, but I figured it would be a waste not to try, and tried out SUBBED version of the series, and I must say that I was STUNNED by a drastic change of the quality and enjoyment. So I just kept going on and on with the series, catching up in a really short period of time. I heard that ""Funimation"" started doing the job all the way from the start, in uncut version.

"One Piece is a fun show, plain and simple. Normally, I'm all about serious, intelligent anime, but One Piece is my big exception. There are a lot of good, high class shows out there worth watching for the artistic value. But we can't forget the main purpose anime is designed for: entertainment. And when it comes to pure, non-thought-provoking entertainment, it's hard to beat a kid literally made out of rubber beating the crap out of a clown who can disassemble himself. (And that's just Season One! There's much crazier stuff than that.) What I love about One Piece is that it never even tries to be serious. The characters are all zany, yet they remain engaging enough to hold the attention of someone like me who looks for something with a little more substance than your average kid's show. New main characters are gradually introduced throughout the series, and each one makes a meaningful contibution. Most of these characters are added when Luffy, the self-appointed captain of this crew, randomly decides he likes them and wants them to come along which adds to the silliness. Another aspect of this show that sets it apart from the rest of the shounen action crowd is the consistency of the characters abilities. The members of the Straw Hat Crew are never forced to undergo some random quantum leap in power level in order to defeat their enemies. This means that despite the fact that the show is currently almost 350 episodes in length, none of the characters have experienced the continuous exponential increase in power seen in other shows that would otherwise give them the abilities of Superman by this point. Despite the length of the series, the material for each new episode is usually fresh, with a surprisingly small amount of filler and recap (though it does have some.) The action moves along fast enough that each new episode is simultaneously satisfying, yet leaves the viewer looking forward to the next one. I'd say the main weakness of the show is the tendency to crank up the cheesiness factor just a little beyond my tolerance point on occasion. Other viewers could be affected by this to a greater or lesser extent than I am; it's really all a matter of personal preference. One other disclaimer: do not watch the 4kids dubbed version. Just about any fansub is better, since the dub is censored and material is removed to such an extent that the quality is adversely affected.",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_80264f8984,3,2410

"Before watching One Piece I was skeptical of watching it. It was one of the most popular animes out there but it just did not look like my sort of thing. Eventually my friend who got into anime started watching it and told me of its greatness, but I was still put off it. Finally after nagging me to watch it I caved in and started. I am glad that happened as it has to be one of my favourite anime's ever! Story (10) The story at first may sound simple. A young pirate sets out to find a crew and the lost treasure of one piece, although it quickly becomes more and more complex with all the stories of each character to the individual arcs. Oda has created a huge world like no other. Simply amazing. Art (9) The art at the start of One Piece may not look that great but that's because it was made in 2000. The art gradually gets better and throughout the 400+ episodes it starts to get amazing. Everything is thoroughly detailed. Sound (10) I loved the opening and endings to the anime aswell as the sounds that the characters make when they are doing their special moves. It makes the anime come alive. Character (10) One pieces characters are revolutionary. They are detailed in both art and story. The back stories of each character and their personalities are amazing. Enjoyment (10) One piece was a rollercoaster ride with ups and downs. Places when I would be in stiches from laughing or tearing up in some of the emotional episodes. One piece has everything in it from Comedy to drama to a bit of romance. I highly enjoyed this anime from start to finish. I nearly went 24 hrs watching episode after episode since It kept me wanting more. Overall (10) Overall I would rate this anime a 10/10 simply because it is unbelievable.

I dropped the anime when it started the previous saga to the actual one (punk Hazard, i guess), that means that i hav not seen a single chapter in three years.

Fisherman Island. Oda is obsesed about telling what is doing every strawhat, and that it's quite tiring. If you substract the op, the ending, and the resume, the chapter will get reduced to 10 minutes. Surprise! It won't happen anything in that time. The thing that names the chapter will happen at the last moment, so you'll have to wait another delicious week. -The obsesion of oda, of being always telling the past of the characters, olds and news. I found this aspect disgusting and pityful. Would not it be better, if you'd insinuate things about the character instead of let out all the information? It's horrible being in the middle of a great saga, and realize we have got involved in a 10-chapters flashback. I can understand it with the main characters, but Oda NEEDS TO DO IT WITH EVERY ONE. I DO NOT CARE ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT THEIR LIVES. Those two aspects, made me take a little..... 3 years break. I don't know if i will see it again. The art has become poorer and poorer. Neves have been an important thing, but some of the last chapters i saw weren't very well animated. And the Tits of Namy and Robin looks like an universe in continue expansión. Those two used to be, 2 sexy chicks. That's only my humble opinion. It's still a nice series, but i can't follow it week by week. Or my pity and disgust will overpass me and i'll became a monster. Probably. However, in general is fine. Music can be very surprising, there are very epic moments (and there will be) and each time i listen ''we are'' i only can say..... that crap was good (in the good sense)",1,Not Recommended,"Dec 23, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f3c1cd5a0,3,1980
"What could possibly be more exciting then being a pirate sailing the seas battling against other pirates, getting into ruffles with the government at the same time searching for new crew members and for the ultimate treasure? Sounds like an adventure eh? The surprising thing about One piece is that every small thing to the very detail is done to the finest level. I cant complain about any facet of this show and ill tell you why. One piece does everything surprisingly well, it possesses an entertaining story, with interesting characters and even mixes in intense drama which is huge since the show is a comedy first type show. One piece starts off with the main protagonist Luffy, one of the most ridiculous looking pirates ever, in search of the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. This treasure was hidden somewhere in mysterious oceans known as the grand line by the greatest pirate in history Gold D. Rodger. Nearly every episode is hilarious as you watch this half-minded pirate do incredible things, meet incredible pirates and so on. For anyone who watches Action shonen animes like Naruto or Bleach, One piece actually does something better then those shows, it entertains fans nearly every episode(although a few fillers exist here and their, they are still quite entertaining) and it knows how to present a story with very fascinating characters. I&rsquo;m calling all anime fans to check out this great series but I would be doing you a disservice by not informing you of the fallowing: DO NOT WATCH IN ENGLISH SUBS. This show was introduced in Japanese and is excellent in its original without censorship. The American censorship attempts to water down the show for children by removing heavily violent scenes and explicit plots. The English voice actors are horrible as well&hellip; need I say more? Anyway watch one piece you are guaranteed laughs and an adventure.",10,Recommended,"Sep 11, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1459314e0c,3,1882
"I deserve a trophy. As of this writing, I have watched 577 episodes. At the very least I'm entitled to a ribbon for participation. Please excuse the satire, yet fully stated, following One Piece is a life decision you can't go back on. I've heard stories and things labeled as 'larger-than-life' from time to time, which as a literal thing is hard to imagine, and I'll tell you One Piece is larger than those things. If something truly is larger-than-life, as some frightful things are, it would lose recognizably, and have to appeal on upheaval or shock. One Piece is not larger than life. Hear me say, with all appeal, that One Piece delivers as large as life can. Now the life of a subject notwithstanding, there's the honest directive. One Piece is indeed huge. The manga has been serialized since 1997 and the anime airing since 1999. I'm amazed every time I'm reminded of this. Stories are rarely if ever allowed a life so long. Sense dictates the market at large would become bored, yet it marches on. I've only come to the series in 2010 myself, which is truly stunning both how long it took to finish and how it still converts so far into its lifespan. Shōnen giants have meritable criticism. Drawn out plots, dragging episodes, truly few bursts of action, and many disposable characters. It would be a bold-faced lie to claim that One Piece is an exception. The popular obeys popular formula. Only the contrarian will find problem with that and, besides, unimaginable popularity is not well-liked by the hipster generation. I once held One Piece to disdain. 4kids produced a very awful dub I saw on saturday mornings as a kid. Its huge popularity seemed unjustified to my closed eyes. A fan of something so huge and bland would likely be boring, a sheep coddled by peers and fearful of anything outside their comfort zone. Simple minded fans always exist, so do not take my elitist prejudice to heart. It's no quality I'm proud of. Winter break listlessly rolled by. I was a freshman in college and belatedly frustrated with my social situation. That may or may not matter. Animation has never been a focal point in my life, but I will always very much enjoy a good story. It doesn't matter where or how it comes to me - just if it reminds me of something, anything, important. There are infinite ways to look at life. I'll tell you why I watch animation to tell you why I finished One Piece, because it is the same. I was looking for something to burn out with, insomniac halfway into winter, my strength fissured into coping instead creating. That is when I want things to move in front of me instead of me moving them myself. What made me choose to start watching One Piece, and I mean definitively, I cannot say. I reasoned I deserved to give the show another chance - it was popular for a reason or something along those lines - but looking back there was nothing logical behind it. There isn't much logic to go around at three in the morning. I watched twenty episodes straight, ending at noon the next day. The show's whimsy and optimism - in a same line Luffy's childishness and excitement - kept me rapt during a dank time. It may have been a false attachment at first, but from Zoro's backstory forward I was in a combined state of excitement and satisfaction. Episodes turned like simple pages in a story, speeding forward until I reached an insane one hundred episode total. A long show spans a hundred episodes, but One Piece barely begins. In the middle of the Arabasta arc, some hundred episodes in, I actually had to justify and think about why I watched the show. Before then, watching continued effortlessly, just as only wanting to know what happens. Whether or not a story provokes such a feeling is only a trick of pacing and has nothing to do with quality. Eventually, everything becomes evaluated, and despite being bored with the Straw Hats wandering forever in the desert, I found it was not simple joy, excitement, or shameful pacing that held my attention, though they did help. It was the show's surprising depth, not only in character development, but the attention to detail put into the entire world. If you make it to the Water 7/Enies Lobby continual arcs, know that you've reached the single part of the story that enables me to say One Piece matches up to any great and peerless execution of storytelling. There are many stories with that honor, however, that makes it no less of a feat. Without giving much away, there is driving contention in the crew caused by a practical problem and a more sinister one. A new character's main reason for living intersects with one protagonist's main reason to die. An old protagonist finally succumbs to his lasting doubts and shadows, acting most shocking and out of character for the genre - but thankfully not the show. The main villians are inexplicable and hard to believe at first, yet after, and somehow because of, initial appearances, they are more than enough to drive the story forward. The many conflicts, subplots, and rapid changes make this story arc the most complex and rewarding in the series and allow me to recommend One Piece to anyone without a shadow of a doubt. I nearly quit in the second half of the Skypiea arc. It encompasses many of the bad points of the show - many bland characters outside the main cast (from Enel's wacky helpers to the clueless Conis), overkill pacing (Satori's ridiculous ""Trial of Balls"" lasted like four episodes), and few moments of excitement (Chopper had the only respectable fight and it was against a guy who would forget to open his mouth when speaking). However, snuck close to the end of the arc are three entirely wonderful episodes concerning a Montblanc Norland. They have nothing to do with the main plot - even occurring 400 years in the past from the main characters - and yet is of the greatest subplots One Piece has. The show had before convinced me of a world to breathe in, but somehow it had me interested in its history, even without a real pay off. Anything concerning a Gol D. Roger is even more exciting and equally removed from Luffy's quest, all to an extent. There aren't many stories where even its history remains interesting and convincing. If you haven't seen the show, I realize my review isn't being very accessible anymore. There is so much to cover when something is so long, so I know not to try to cover everything. One Piece truthfully remains very consistent throughout its entirety. Though many major plotlines have been boring or even poor from times, the show has never been dedicated to a major plot, or it would have ended by now. When others describe why they enjoy the show so much, many point to its character development, comedy, art style, and its densely woven plot. Especially liked is the very intense chekhov's army. Characters and concepts introduced anywhere in the show appear and reappear when it's appropriate (and many times even when it is not, such as Usopp befriending giants for no reason than knowing other giants), but appropriateness truly does not matter, for the directive is to make events connected, so that the characters live in a present represented by a real past. There is beauty in telling a story about a world, instead of only about characters, or only about a thing. To use a daft example, the Lord of the Rings has a fantastic reputation as a fantasy novel, maybe even recognized for the wrong reasons (thank hollywood). The Lord of the Rings is a post-modern epic and I mean that literally. I shall define an epic that lives in its folklore and obeys it completely, like a recognizable Greek epic The Odyssey. I want to believe the greatness of an epic is not totally reliant on its heroic characters, though they contribute greatly. A fantasy epic takes a picture of an impossible world and makes it a possibility. Those are the simplest terms, but it is not the act of creation that is important, it is the completeness. The world's culture, laws, & customs are obeyed naturally in the telling and the characters, while important, impact overall a small part in history. When I think of Lord of the Rings, I don't think too much of its band of heroes, the struggle of good versus evil, or the strength of good nature. For me what stays is how detailed the world is and how far Tolkien went. It is a story about Frodo and the Ring, and yet it is a world of so much more. One Piece can be called post-postmodern, if you're silly, because it is very much simple and bright instead of being grim and refined. Wouldbe epics try to be grim and defined. And wouldbe epics do not have a world I believe in, which is why they're only caricatures of the worlds around us. One Piece, at a certain point, became a true fantasy epic. It is a story about Luffy and finding One Piece, and yet it is a world of so much more. Everything surrounding the characters oozes with careful thought. One Piece no longer feels only like Luffy's story or just the story of the Straw Hat pirates but a recounting of history by the movers and makers themselves - a fictional history that feels so very real. I remember my cousin over and we were eating pizza. It was shortly into winter break. My hand was my plate, pizza doesn't need a plate, but he was holding a plate with pizza. Eating pizza, holding pizza, he looked liked he wanted to say something and didn't know how. The need to share won over the insecurity of sharing and he asked me if I ever heard of a show called One Piece. Call it coincidence, still, I had just watched Luffy's final fight with Crocodile and was able to express how much I liked the show. He was a bit farther, starting the Davy Back fights if I remember, and was very excited that the insecurity never existed. He was excited he had someone to share this world with, I'd guess. At first, when we talked about the show, we would focus on the main characters and talk about what fights we liked, what lines we liked, what backstories we most appreciated, and inevitably what characters were the best. Two years later, we have both finished the show, and end up talking about it when we see eachother, at least to discuss the most current episodes. Sometimes the discussion spills over when either mentions how much we like the show, or how such and such used to be better, or what arcs we loved and hated. Now when we talk about One Piece it could easily last hours - it is, after all, nearly 200 hours long - yet we do not focus on the main characters as we used to. A comparatively small part of our talks touches on the protagonists, partially because we both know them so well, mostly because we're talking about the world at large. One piece has a world you can picture, a world you can really talk about, a world to be excited for. I very much like stories, as I say, but it's hard to say flat things about a whole world. I very much like worlds too. It's different, to say the least, and despite any insipid moment, I believe One Piece is a world worthy of any others and is an absolute joy to experience.",9,Recommended,"Dec 19, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2145e56624,3,11035
"One piece holds a special place in my heart, similar to how Bleach is for me because these two anime were the long running ones which I saw after watching Naruto and getting introduced to anime. One piece is seemingly just two words but if you'd ask me about how I describe this series then it would be just one word. Legendary! Initially before watching One piece, I was the type of person who like everyone else was daunted by the abysmal amount of episodes, I started One piece in 2015, and back then the episode count was around 500 or something like that. The story of what made me start One piece is a weird one as I was not compelled by something like the story or social media or something normal like that. What made me start watching one piece was, Believe it or not, It was Opening 14. I somehow saw that opening randonly on Youtube one day and it was so good that I started One piece not long after. Initially I binged the first 100 episodes but then took a few month break due to studies. Then I came back to watch it and the rest is history. Now let's move toward the review! Story : You cant find faults here, because there are none. It has everything, Action, Adventure, Mystery, Romance, Comedy, Politics, Dark side of society (Slavery), Prostitution etc. There's a reason why it has been running for 25+ years. It actually is the best selling manga in Japan, comparing with the likes of Superman or Batman comics and even beating their sales if I recall correctly. It's just such a wild and heartwarming journey which cant be explained in words. Characters : Every single character is unique , No two characters are the same. The cast is so so big and it keeps growing. The main strawhat group is one big family and makes me feel like I'm a part of their family aswell. Animation : Toei is infamous for the handling of the One piece anime. Poor pacing and dragging of an episode to the point of absurdity. But they've gotten better over the years definitely. They atleast did this story justice and continue to pour out episode after episode and lately their work in the Wano (Most recent arc at the time of writing this review) has been phenomenal. Soundtrack : Compliments the series so well, Every opening and ending is well crafted. Enjoyment : When you watch something for so long that it becomes a part of your life, kind of like what Naruto was for me. One piece is the same for me. Its still going on and I watch it weekly and have amazing and beautiful memories with it. If you truly have the will and time to invest for the amount of episodes, watching One piece wont let you down. Trust me. It is THE BEST anime probably and the day it ends will probably mark an end of an era and I hope Iam alive to witness that glorious historic occasion.

"Initially I was wary of watching this popular shounen anime as I preferred shoujo or romance anime. I also thought the art was sort of wonky at first, but upon starting this show I was overwhelming pleased. The story and art are, for lack of better words, amazing. I began watching One Piece two months ago and caught up to the 455 episodes in that time and can't wait for more releases each week. Although OP is considered part of the Jump trifecta along with Naruto and Bleach it's really in a league of its own, far surpassing these two in enjoyment and story. Frankly, the others aren't worth watching at all. One Piece has amazing flow between episodes and VERY few filler arcs. Luffy is also one of the greatest main characters of all time and is supported by an amazing cast that really allows the viewer to understand One Piece's overarching theme of being ""nakama."" Even the secondary characters are extremely lovable. One Piece is definitely worth watching no matter what type of anime you are into.

"3 Simple words: BEST ANIME EVER !!! The big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, but to me, One Piece is the only big one. This one contains the least fillers of the big 3. Even tough every character gets introduced over a couple of episodes (in which you learn about their history and create a real connection), all eps are relevant to the series. Even episodes that look like fillers at 1st, get some part in the main story afterwards...

"The Greatest Work of All Time One Piece is incomparable to any other story. You simply cannot compare a tale that has been building for 1,100+ episodes/chapters. These aren’t just episodes stacked on top of each other they are pieces meticulously planned by the author from the very beginning, all forming an intricate and cohesive narrative. Positives: - Cohesion: A grand tapestry continuously being woven together to form one final masterpiece. Nothing is random; everything is planned. Even the fights are structured so that no character is too strong or too weak, and no underpowered character holds a role that feels disproportionate to their strength or influence. - A story planned from the start: What happens in Episode 1 might not make full sense until Episode 452 and even then, your perspective will shift again at Episode 683. A simple drawing that seemed meaningless at first could turn out to be the cornerstone of the entire story 600 episodes later. - A living world: While Luffy is living his adventure, things are happening elsewhere in the world, leading to real consequences. Likewise, the crew’s actions impact the world around them. It doesn’t feel like we’re just following a protagonist—it’s like witnessing an entire ecosystem and global geopolitics unfold. - Countless plotlines and subplots: You’ll never run out of mysteries to explore or theories to debate in One Piece. - Unparalleled diversity: With over 1,000 named characters, islands, creatures, oceans, powers, and mysteries—all interconnected with their own stories, relationships, and secrets you’re guaranteed to have at least 10 favorite characters. - Incredible soundtrack. - Fantastic voice acting (as is often the case for anime in their original version). - An ever-improving animation quality despite the demanding weekly schedule. Negatives (unfortunately, there are some): - A sometimes slow pace, especially towards the end, due to the weekly release schedule stretching out episodes. - Story arcs can sometimes feel too similar. - Humor gets repetitive: The same jokes for 1,000 episodes can become tiring. - Too much focus on every crew member: While it's admirable that Oda wants to give every character their moment in each arc, it slows down the story at times. Final Verdict: The negatives I’ve mentioned are minor nitpicks compared to the overall quality of the series. You will never regret investing your time in One Piece.

"I've said this before. One Piece is one of those stories you'd write as a 12 year old, look back, have all kinds of good feelings, but realize it's a FAR cry from a real story. Some characters have amazing designs, pretty cool abilities, but the rest... nah. No character development, no story progression. Luffy doesn't question his actions once. Sure, he's hardened by the death of Ace, but at the end of the day, he's still the same Luffy you know from before right? He hasn't changed. Most characters don't change. Their goals remain the same, their ""never-ending adventure"" goes on, and the story doesn't leave you hints about what the one piece treasure could possibly be. In a sense, you can compare it to a cartoon like Scooby Doo. The gang's doing the same old shenanigans, just with Shonen tropes thrown in. Sabo has something that's akin to development, because you see how he was back then, then how he grows up, but I'd argue that's because Oda himself has admitted at a point that he doesn't know what the other characters are like in an interview besides what they do. For example, he knows Luffy would eat a piece of meat if it fell off the sky, and Zoro would slice it up, but, what else? People are human beings, not human doings. In a sense, you need to articulate real feelings to make them relatable. Anyone can write a death scene, it's the easiest thing to write. But that's because everyone experiences death somewhere somehow in their life at least once, and it can be from a person close to your heart or a complete stranger you just met. That's why I said Sabo is a prime example of he's kind of grown as a writer, in a sense that he's able to develop a character that goes through a certain state of change based on the circumstances given to him. That's why Oda focuses on building more places, more islands, more things to explore, because his world doesn't feel LIVED in, as in, it's like seeing something for the first time, but if you were to watch or read it again? What other depth is there? Does the character's power symbolize some kind of critical change and defining moments of character growth? If so, is it positive or negative? For example, Obito from Naruto. He sees Rin dies, and that's because he wasn't able to make it there in time, in fact he's always been kind of late to things his whole life. What's the Mangekyo that develops for him? Kamui. To transport himself anywhere, to make it in time. With Itachi, it's the fact that people around him made him question their worth, even his own clan, so Tsukuyomi, the ability to make people believe in illusions, and Amaterasu for him and Sasuke, for both want to burn those who have hurt them, with Sasuke even more so, because his other eye controls the flames to an even larger extent as his target isn't just hatred towards how he's been forced to act, but how the world around him robbed him of his entire family. You see the same thing with Nen in Hunter x Hunter. A person's aura and Nen ability is developed alongside how their characters have changed and the abilities grow and progress towards how their characters have changed as a person. This is most prevalent with JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. A Stand goes through Acts 1-3, sometimes 4, signaling growth in the person's character, how they either gain confidence or falls. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Let me ask you this, if you stayed the same throughout your life without changing, do you think that's a good thing? And please don't give me the ""it's entertainment, it's not real life"", like no. Art is a form of self expression, in an essence, it is derived from real life experiences and emotions. If you had a friend who never learned their lessons despite the problems arising from their actions, would you still hang out with them knowing YOU could end up as collateral damage? This is why Flat characters RARELY work. No one in reality goes with changing. You aren't even the person you were yesterday let alone a few seconds ago. You aren't even breathing the same oxygen molecules you just did. Is there anyone you actually know in real life that remained the same? Nope. The character they play? Maybe it remains the same, but the inner person inside of them must have gone through some changes, am I right? Oda's usage of the Flat character trope is shallow at best, when it comes to literature. On the other hand, Yoshihiro Togashi uses the Flat character with Gon, and goes the length to deconstruct him, and build him back up. He's still a ""Flat"" character, but the way he goes about being one is entirely laced with deep nuances. It also doesn't help that One Piece is entirely a product that looks like the editorial team meddling with the work. It just looks, sounds, and feels like a product of business decisions, made to remain the same for the sake of being as recognizable over the years to make as much money as possible. In a sense, any artistic exploration is denied for the sake of being household milking cow. I have read the manga, surprisingly, up until the latest chapters. And, I'm also aware that every character is simply sinking into the idea of the characters embodying their philosophies. I am also aware of how different the manga and the anime are in regards to it's depiction. What I've argued is that there is no depth. And I know it is a thematic choice. That's specifically why I said it's something that looks like it came from a 12 year old who hasn't learned reality. I didn't say it was an inability, but I did say Oda doesn't give much thought to what each character would actually be feeling, beyond their beliefs and ideals. It is by no means, a higher art form. And it's fine being that way, but that means you gave up any thought of self improvement because you're fine with being who you are, even if realistically speaking, it's not a healthy way to be. See the reason why epic poems made sense and are considered higher art forms is because they were layered with nuances. One Piece is not. It tried to emulate it, but it ultimately isn't, even if it follows the same format. Also, might I add that being a ""Pirate King"" makes no sense? Being a pirate means you are free already, doing whatever you want, and for there to be a King, do you think that that plays into an ideology of what a pirate is? It's not the same thing as being Hokage. Luffy stated he doesn't want to be someone important, he just wants to be the Pirate King. But isn't the Pirate King an important person by title then? This is like a child saying he wants to be president, but he doesn't want to do anything important, he just wants to achieve the status and rank. I'm not saying it's wrong to dream, but at some point, the dream ends and reality begins. It's the epitome of strawman arguments, ironically, that's the title of his crew, the Straw Hats. Even epics write in stories about overcoming hardships, furthering ideologies, but they also highlight weak flaws inherent in the characters that can be reflected back to the human condition. Luffy, for all purposes, is a caricature of what characters like Goku are. Stupid, stubborn, strong, and have a certain charisma to them. With no explanations beyond those. He does not embody any weak flaw the human condition has to offer that can reflected back into the person viewing it, which is why I think it has no value beyond provoking imagination. Ideologies need to be questioned, even by one's self in order to reinforce it, not just go forward with it with no repercussions. Even Naruto learned this the hard way. Sure you can say characters don't need to develop and progress into something new, but that's basically making a show for kids that's actually meant for kids. Which is probably why it sells well. It does the Shonen trope by the books, and does nothing more. What's more boring than doing everything by the books, especially since there's a hundred of them out there JUST like that? The first ones you pick up might leave a special place in your heart, and I've remained with it just because it was something I picked up when I was young, but any reasonable adult will eventually realize that dreams do come to an end at some point. There is no meaning in a never ending story or dream. Good stories have an ending, because they offer lessons to be learnt. One Piece is subpar at best. And it's the king of it. The problem with Oda is his inability to portray them beyond that. At least in MHA, we got Stain and other villains who aren't really villains. With One Piece, it's clear as day if you have any logical comprehension skill who's on what side because Oda relies on the labels he created too damn much. Sure, characters can say they don't have an allegiance anywhere, but at the end of the day, you KNOW who they're going to side with and WHAT they will do. You KNEW Law would play the whole ""I'm your ally, but not really gonna join you, but I'm still somewhat of an ally"" trope just based on his design alone, by how unique it looks and what it says about the characters. Law wanting revenge of Doffy? Man, his backstory just reeks of Oda's usual ""oh look, character with tragic backstory."" Also, about Brooks? Yeah, A LOT of writers do that. They look back on their work or have an idea in mind about how to relate characters back to some other character they created. It's actually relatively as easy as ""this is my long lost brother"" character trope. My point has always been, does his character designs and powers say something about their psyche? The human conditioning they have? Are their relationships reflections of what each other lack? Is the relationship a metaphorical symbolism of some statement? In most cases, Oda doesn't even do this. Take Persona 5 the game for example. Each character manifests a Persona that is a reflection of their psyche based on Tarot cards, much like Stands were in the beginning of JoJo. They each represent some type of metaphor, straight down to their designs. One Piece has nothing on this. Just because someone does something to appease to a larger crowd doesn't mean it's any good. That's just settling for what you can get. What the public loves and what you yourself love is different to begin with. You go by Mob Mentality, rather than what you yourself think has value, you're doomed to be stuck an entertainer who can only entertain based on things you know the public loves, for example, juggling, performing circus acts, walking across a rope, all that stuff. It's all been seen before, and it offers nothing new.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 25, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9cf1b05758,4,10553
"Let’s cut to the chase, this anime has a good concept but is horribly executed, it is entirely consistent of filler episodes and movies that don’t perform well as this show constantly keeps going and going never reaching the premise or point of things. At the end of the day its the same thing repeated all over again, a stupid adventure, dumb jokes some being sexual which are overall unfunny. This anime certainly does have a successful idea but at some point it just gets tiresome. It is not worth watching over 1000 episodes for, its filler, filler, filler, nothing more and nothing less. It is so slow and it is definitely for the money which infuriates me onto why people like it, it’s slow purposely I believe for money and they keep making more movies and shows instead of actually getting to the point. It’s the same thing over and over.",3,Not Recommended,"Nov 2, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d0583ea1ed,4,846
"Well..let me make it simple for everyone..Its about this young boy who sets out on a journey to fulfill his dream of being the pirate king and finding the all time treasure known as One Piece. Gold D Roger the previous pirate king,had been captured and on the day of his death sentence he told the people hat he had left his treasure in the grand line which then started the great pirate age.The devil fruits in this anime grants inhumane power to anyone who eats it but is cursed to never be able to swim. People who havent watched this anime to watch it!!!!!!.If u have watched the 4kids dubbed version just erase it from your mind and watch the japanese version.Its funny and the way the characters are voiced are just absolutely great.In the beginning arcs it may be a little boring for some viewers but trust me and i seriously mean trust me..it gets way way way funnier and it gets way more interesting in the later episodes.believe me.To me there may be some expressions they make which can look a little lame but come on man nothings perfect :P.. Art: as for the art..u cant say its awesome.Its a little old and all but who cares XD you'll get used to it eventually if u continue watching :) Sound: good voice actors and actress that voices their characters ..i think they're very talented Character:Monkey D Luffy(Main MAIN character) .Along with his trusting crew mates .Roronoa zoro the swordsman , Sanji the perverted cook that loves women lol , chopper the doctor in the crew - shy and adorable, Nami - the navigator shes witty and quite violent, Nico Robin the archaeologist - she loves anything related to history, Usopp - the sniper of their crew, Franky - the ship wright of the crew and lastly Brook- im not so sure what he is but i know that hes a perverted dead skeleton dude that came back to life therese characters wont be introduced immediately but they will slowly be introduced later in the series Enjoyment: so far i have to say this is a very enjoyable anime Overall id give it a 9 or 10 becos its really awesome :3",10,Recommended,"Oct 17, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5d37b23a2a,4,2043
"""I'm going to be the King of the Pirates and find the One Piece!"" -Monkey D. Luffy.... *goes on to never actually TRY to find the One Piece, and instead parties and goofs off in every arc possible. In fact, the only person in the crew searching for the literal title of the show is Nico Robin (best girl by the way).* Like many shows, One Piece has its good qualities and its bad ones...unfortunately, the bad qualities of this show heavily outweigh the good ones in my personal experience. Let's talk about the good qualities first: WorldBuilding (great): One Piece has one of the most intrisic worlds in animanga, and is not afraid to show it off. Oda-sensei did a fantastic job with his worldbuilding, although...he kind of has to considering it is a series focused on the adventure and journey. 9/10 That's it. That's the only good quality I could find. Now let's get into the rest: Characters (mixed): Characters are the biggest mechanism for a story to progress, and One Piece often fails to impress with its cast of characters. The main crew lacks any real character development outside of levelling up in power, and are only each given a sad backstory to satisfy the mark of attachment that readers and watchers can attain. After their backstory, they don't grow at all. They just have the same personality and quirks that we already saw from them in the beginning. The main character being stupid isn't new, but the level of stupidity he has is far too much that it isn't even funny. The comedy from the characters feels like it was written by a five-year old that goes around telling the same jokes because one person laughed at it before. The art style of the characters is ""unique"", but appalling to look at. Like seriously, what is up with their designs?! All in all, the characters are not terrible...but....to each their own I guess. 4/10 Pacing (horrendous): Lawd gawd, where do I begin with this one. Never in my years have I ever watched something so slowly paced to the point that i would dose off in the middle of the day....even if I genuinely HATE taking naps! This anime's pacing is BY FAR its biggest issue, as it takes filler material and adds it to the canon episodes instead of just leaving filler episodes seperate like Bleach and Naruto. If something like a shock factor happens, it will take years for Toei Animation to milk all of the reactions as much as possible from the people seeing it unfold, until finally deciding to carry on with the plot. On top of that, there are always tons of minutes allocated to recaps, making up for at least 5 minutes every damn time. I can understand that it is a weekly show, and that they do not want to catch up to the manga so that they can still have space to breathe...but enough is enough, they are simply ruining the show. You know it is bad when your show's fanbase has to literally create a seperate website where they fix the anime's pacing issues (onepace is the website I am speaking of by the way). 0/10, and that's being kind. Story (boring as hell): I'm sorry, but this story is boring as all hell. Luffy screams he want to be the pirate king once every 200 hundred episodes to the point that I forget that's even the point of the show. Majority of the time I keep assuming he just wants to party and goof off with his friends. He doesn't even give you a reason to follow him on his journey, he just screams and screams and people seem to love it. Naruto wants to become the hokage to earn people's respect, Asta wants to become the wizard king to prove people wrong, Luffy wants to become the pirate King because....when his brother/mentor talked about he thought it sounded cool. Wow. How inspiring. The arcs are repetive, it's just about the Straw Hats going to a random island, getting split up because...who even knows, Luffy encounters a princess or damsel in distress, Luffy fights the bad guy and loses, plot armor saves him, he comes back like a hero accompanied by his crew and he beats the bad guy while his crew beats the side villains. After saving the island, he jumps around like an idiot, eats meat, takes some treasure, and then leaves. Sound familiar? Yes...because it's the most basic plot structure you can ever find in a story. Not every arc is the same, but even the ones that are different end up being stupid as all hell. Such as Marineford where all of the pirates come to save one idiot that ends up forsaking all of their efforts just because of a ""yo daddy"" joke. The plot is HEAVILY dependant on the worldbuilding, which I believe often masks the eyes of fans from seeing how poorly written it is. Such as the comedy in Fairy Tail or the fights in Dragon Ball (I'm a Fairy Tail fan, I would know). All in all, the story doesn't inspire me, and that's that. But like I said, to each their own. 1/10 Animation/Quality (bad): The animation of the show isn't my biggest issue, but I do have to say that I do not find it appealing in all of the 700+ episodes I forced myself to watch. The fights feel stale, I've seen fanmade animations better than this stuff. That doesn't necessarily only go to the animations studio's issues, but also to the source material - no offense Oda-sensei, but I genuinely wish you could make better fights that have better tactics and stakes involved. The sound designs are also terrible, all I'm hearing is some type of horns and slow beats that sounds like a newly formed marching band at a high school game. For me, the intensity of the sound design in fights adds to the hype...and I certainly feel no hype whatsoever watching and listening to this show. 2/10, the impressive voice acting is the only reason I rated it higher than one Fanbase (worst of the worst): Even after everything mentioned, I don't necessarily hate One Piece at all. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I don't like being a negative person, I simply reciprocate emotions that are pushed onto me. So why am I making this review? BECAUSE OF THE GODFORSAKEN FANBASE! These people have somehow created a faction of worshippers to not only the show, but to the creator! They call him Goda. At first I thought it was cool that they would be so respectful to their favorite mangaka, but it's actually past the point of insanity! These people see NO wrong with the show whatsoever, to the point that if you don't like it, they will literally attack you for it! I've never seen a fanbase, not only in anime but throughout all of fiction, behave the way these people do. Making fun of a Boruto fan that passed away in an accident, mass downvoting on IMDB for Attack on Titan's highest rated episodes, slandering every anime fandom and their favorite anime if they don't have One Piece in their top 3 at the least...and many many more. They have even turned the idea of it being a kids show (which it is) into a philisophical masterpiece...because of what? Luffy embodying freedom? AS A PIRATE?! Luffy literally has higher IQ than these people, I kid you not. With all due respect to Goda, I mean Oda-sensei....One Piece is made even worse because of its fanbase, and I stand by that. Negative Infinity / 10 Overall, One Piece at one point almost made me quit anime because I used to believe that anime is specifically for weirdos, and used to make fun of anime watchers all the time. The pacing, the lack of motivation I feel, and the lack of entertainment I attained all made that point even more clear to me until my friend and sister forced me to watch Attack on Titan and My Hero Academia. I only kept watching more of it because of consistent harrassment from One Piece fans on my Tiktok page, as they said I have no reason to not like it if I haven't ""watched enough of it"". Now that I have, I simply ""don't understand it"". I'm tired of this show, and even more so its fans. So if you are reading this...do yourself a favor, and stay away from this show. Even if you even up likiing it, I would hate to see more people added into that shameful fanbase.",2,Not Recommended,"Sep 20, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7c71cfa6bb,4,7956
"One Piece is one of the three kings of Shounen. This is an undisputed fact. The anime started back in 2000 (the manga in 1997), and has been going strong for over 10 years now. Given that, I think it's fair to say that if nothing more, something's gotta be going right for it to last that long. Now I, like everyone else who has reviewed the show, am giving it a 10, a rave review, and overall I've lopped off one of my fingers and replaced it with a thumb, solely to gain the ability of giving this show 3 thumbs up. But understand, I've re-watched this series from the beginning 4 times now, and read through the manga twice. I know One Piece inside and out, and I'm not here to simply rave. I'm here to give it a fair review. Shounen Syndrome is an anime infection with symptoms ranging from over-exposed attack explanations to lengthy conversations where they aren't necessary to horrendous filler arcs and even all the way to episode recaps that take up a good quarter of the time the episode is alloted. One Piece is not immune to this. No attack can simply go unnamed, or unexplained. Though they'll only explain it once, and it's usually not as horrible as it sounds. Though One Piece is in an interesting position in that they know it's ridiculous. The joking nature of the characters often brings up the ""It's not cool if it doesn't have a cool name"" mentality. So you could let One Piece off the hook to some extent, as it almost satirizes the rest of shounen by participating. One Piece also did something I'm not a big fan of. Starting around episode 300, they started using opening themes that lasted a full 2 and a half minutes. Followed by 30 seconds of intro, and then 30 seconds - 3 minutes of recap. Sometimes you'll have to start watching 6 minutes into the episode to actually get to new content. But this is both a blessing and a curse. For you see, One Piece filler tends to be pretty horrible. So, around episode 300, they upped the animation quality for widescreen TV. And to be able to put out this quality animation once a week, a shorter episode time makes the jobs of the animators easier, and production more cost effective. This meant a more quality product, in shorter spurts. The shorter spurts however, contribute to less filler. And for this reason alone, the reduced episode time and long recaps are in fact a blessing for One Piece fans. Though not many would know it. So what about the actual show? I'll assume if you're on this page, you already know a bit about One Piece. It's a show following the adventures of Monkey D Luffy and his ragtag crew of pirates searching for the great treasure ""One Piece,"" with the ambition of becoming the Pirate King (the one who rules over the greatest seas of the world). The story is solid, and has only been better developed over time. Oda has done something wonderful, in that he had his story planned out long before it got there, and it seems he's having even more fun with One Piece now than at the start of his career. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment factor One Piece provides. The art style is the biggest complaint I've heard about One Piece. A lot of people have told me they just flat out disliked the art style, and that was one of the biggest reasons they didn't want to watch the show. Though I can't understand this, I guess One Piece's art style is more cartoony than most anime. But that art style reflects the values of the series. It IS cartoony, in spirit. That's kind of the point. That being said, if that's not your thing, I can respect that. The other thing to mention about the animation is that it's been going since the year 2000. As such, earlier episodes definitely aren't up to snuff in terms of animation quality, especially as it's a shounen with a budget. But as the series and time progressed, the animation quality progressed as well and is now very well done. By far though, the characters in One Piece are what you enjoy the most. Luffy is your typical anime shounen, the kind of guy you can't help but love. He's simplistic and dim-witted, but his heart's in the right place and that's what sticks. Everyone is well written and typed, and the character development throughout the series is rather impressive. New synergies arise that both reflect Oda slipping into a more comfortable mindset whilst writing his character's parts, and the characters themselves becoming more accustomed to each other. Overall, One Piece has been going 10 years. And in those 10 years, the crew has grown up and developed with it's audience. Even given it's Shounen faults, it still does an absolutely wonderful job of story telling and entertaining. The main point I would bring up is never watch the 4kids dub. It's not One Piece. If there was one example I could provide to convince you of this, they turned a french chef into a brooklyn accented disaster... smoking a lollipop. That is One Piece. My most timeless anime. It's an experience I would recommend to any and all anime fans, though I know it may not be a good fit for many.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a8d79f6a7e,4,5042
"""One Piece – A Journey Worth Every Second"" One Piece isn’t just an anime—it’s an experience. What starts as a simple pirate adventure quickly turns into one of the most incredible stories ever told. The world is massive, the characters feel real, and the emotional moments hit harder than you'd expect. Luffy and the Straw Hats aren’t just a crew—they feel like family. Each character has their own dreams and struggles, and watching them grow over time is one of the best parts of the series. The world-building is on another level, with every island, faction, and mystery tying together in ways that make you realize just how much thought has gone into it. At over 1,000 episodes, it might seem overwhelming, but that’s what makes it special. Every arc adds something new, and the payoffs for long-running storylines are unbelievably satisfying. The humor, the fights, the emotional gut punches—it’s all perfectly balanced. And with the Wano arc’s insane animation, One Piece is better than ever. If you’re looking for an anime that sticks with you long after you’ve watched it, this is it. Once you set sail with the Straw Hats, there’s no turning back. Waiting for the return of the Straw Hats after the long break!!

"In short One piece has been beating a dead horse for about a decade now I see quite a bit of overhyped fans on here, I'm afraid it's just anywhere close to the hype anymore. Lets start with the story. Story. 1/10. The story is about a boy name luffy that wants to go and reach one piece. Him and his crew member will set sail to go anywhere except one piece. Ridiculous Pirates go on Ridiculous adventures is how I would sum it up, add in a couple of cheap laughs and cheap emotional segments and you have summed one piece up. Art. 2/10 The art in one piece is ridiculous stupid looking the characters have weird over exaggerating expression. When they are shouting or just opening their mouth it's so huge it could fit 10 ships in it. Ed edd n eddy has way better art than one piece and that cartoon was made from the 90s that's to show you how bad the art is. Sound. 7/10 the sound is the best thing in the series this is what made me watch made me watch so much episode of one piece is because I enjoy the sound. I also like to laugh at how stupid it's and how stupid the characters look. Characters. 1/10 The characters are cut out cardboard boxes they dont change they are exactly the same and I'm talking from a manga reader the series has over 700+ chapters and all the characters are still the same. Oda doesn't know what character development means. Enjoyment. 3/10. My enjoyment comes from how stupid it's, I lol so much time while watching this series. it even tries to take it self seriously but failed miserable, lol and that made me laugh a lot so I had some enjoyment in it because of how stupid it's but the other 50% of the series is Luffy running up and down like a chicken without a head which is boring.... overall this series has been dragged on way too long, and for me personally has lost it's appeal long ago, I just had to drop it. However every now and then I will watch it on Toonami for a few cheap laughs other than that i highly recommend you stay away from this anime it just is way to over hyped and they are just beating a dead horse at this point.",2,Not Recommended,"Jan 17, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a946d52892,4,2081
"One Piece, originally a manga written by the genius Eiichiro Oda, was adapted into an anime in 1999. Both the manga and anime are still ongoing, even after hundred of episodes and chapters, and yet One Piece still remains more exciting and thrilling than ever. Even after 400 episodes, the story is getting better and better. It is extremely hard and rare to find animes that have more than 100 episodes... and to never loose its pace is surly an accomplishment. Oda has done something rare - he has created a convincing alternate reality with thousands of interesting characters and places. Each are unique and bizarre in their own way. One Piece is a unique and epic masterpiece which tells the story of a young pirate, named Monkey D. Luffy who sets off to sea to gather a crew and to become the most famous pirate who ever lived, by becoming the Pirate King. The character interaction between Luffy and his crew mates is brilliant in One Piece and never becomes dull. After hundreds of episodes of this show, I gradually became attached to Luffy's crew. This is much drama, fighting, and comedic moments in this grand anime. Since this show was made in 1999, the art for the first couple of episodes can turn people away from this series. The art, of course, gets a lot better as the series progresses and was always interesting for me regardless. It is always inticing to observe the bizarre and intriguing world that Oda has created. The soundtracks are also classics, and even to this day I occasionally listen to them on my youtube playlist. Watching One Piece has become a sort of a ritual for me, as I have been watching a new episode every weekend for the past couple years.

"I don't understand why some people were put off by the arts at first. I just thought it was different when I saw it. I enjoyed the first few episodes and laughed a good couple of times and quickly labeled this show as &quot;For entertainment only&quot; since I thought it was some sort of Random-Funny clip shonen that takes a while to end. But as I continued to watch it and up to the Arlong arc, I was SHOCKED TO DEATH. I didn't know it could get so emotional and deep but it manages to be light hearted at the same time. I was so utterly charmed by Luffy and his crew's personality. They practically highlight each other perfectly, like the colors of a rainbow, they all stick together but each of them stand out, nobody is the same color.

"Before I begin, let me just say that this all my opinion and completely subjective. If you enjoy the show then please ignore this as you will disagree with this for sure! One piece started good and I will be the first one to admit that. It does a good job of giving us a sense of the vastness and richness of its world and the interesting bunch of characters it houses within itself, and not gonna lie, that had me hyped AF. I had a fun time with the first few episodes and I truly used to think that this could be one of the most enjoyable long running anime for me. But as time went on, I started to see the faults in One Piece, and now I just look at it with a sense of disappointment because it has become such a bloated mess that has absolutely not kept up with the modern anime times. At this point, every arc feels like a modified repetition of the previous arcs. It starts off as an epic, long adventure anime which hooks you right from the beginning. The world feels fresh and invoke a sense of curiosity and adventure, and the character interactions felt wholesome and warm. The initial arcs feel enjoyable because of our curiosity to discover the lore of this world, and also because we get invested in the overarching plot of Luffy becoming the Pirate King and finding out what One Piece is. One of the things I really enjoyed and waited for at the end of every arc was to see what Luffy's new bounty would be. Now, here's where things go down the drain. The anime, inexplicably, decides to stretch the main premise to such an astronomical length that you just can't help but feel exhausted and burnt out. Each successive arc feels like the previous arc with added disguise and makeup. Luffy and his crew visit a new island where they discover that the people have been subjugated by an extremely strong Devil Fruit user who just so happens to be relatively somewhere around Luffy's strength. Luffy is set to fight the final boss, Zoro fights the second strongest person, and so on and so forth. You get the idea. People suffer life ending injuries and lose gorillian liters of blood only to somehow clutch the fight in the end. Luffy successfully pulls out a BS new move which defeats the final boss, leaving Luffy barely standing with 1 HP. Then, everyone has a celebration and a feast and the crew carry on with their journey to the next island to pull off the same exact arc once again. The whole thing kind of starts feeling cheap. If this sounds bad, wait till you hear how worse it gets after a certain time-skip. The story repeats upon itself so many times that you just cannot for the love of god feel any excitement at what you are watching. The novelty wore off quick at least in my case. Entire arcs were stretched so much that you cannot even sense any form of a meaningful progression in the plot. To give you an idea, consider this: Usually a decently paced anime adapts anywhere between 2-4 chapters per episode depending upon various factors. Usually, more chapters are adapted per episode if they have a lot of action scenes, and less chapters are adapted per episode if they are dialogue heavy. One Piece has taken 1015 episodes to adapt 1000 chapters. What that means is that the show has not even adapted 1 chapter per episode in its run up till the 1000th chapter which honestly is atrocious to say the least. Also, needless to say, the stakes - both physical and emotional - feel superficial and fake. Same old tropes and methods of trying to evoke an artificial reaction or emotions from the viewers. Also, no character development, in my humble opinion. Usopp, who we once rooted for, became a comedian. Sanji is still a simp with no growing up in sight for him, Zoro is either fighting or setting up his overused gag of being unable to find the way. The world felt huge and interesting in the beginning. Now it feels boring and less creative and just plain predictable. Also, the author kind of forgot to keep the 'One Piece' aspect of the show relevant by at least throwing in some small arcs or plot points and giving us a few substantial crumbs dedicated exclusively about it. But all we get is some insignificant, random teasing with no concrete development to shape what One Piece might be. Kind of frustrating, personally speaking. At this point, the journey has become so boring that I don't care anymore. I will just read up on what One Piece is when it finally gets revealed in the manga in the year 2099. My conclusion is that, the journey was definitely not worth it. I tried getting into manga as well which I was not a big fan of either. I guess that was because the anime left such a sour taste in my mouth. But oh well! There are so many better, shorter, more enjoyable shows out there. I would rather watch the one piece remake by WIT studio which I just know is going to exponentially superior than this slug fest. It might take ages but that's fine, I would rather spend my time watching other better shows in the meantime. 4/10",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 5, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fccd4db86d,4,4984
"Where do I even begin with this monstrosity called ""One Piece""? I had heard so much hype about this anime, but after subjecting myself to a few episodes, I'm left wondering if the creators were on some kind of hallucinogenic substance while putting this disaster together. First of all, the art style is an eyesore. The characters look like they've been drawn by a five-year-old with a crayon in one hand and a chainsaw in the other. It's as if the animators decided to take every feature of the human body and exaggerate it to the point of grotesque deformity. Seriously, I've seen less exaggerated expressions on cartoons meant for toddlers. And let's talk about the pacing – or rather, the lack thereof. It's like the creators discovered the concept of filler episodes and decided to take it to a whole new level. The story moves at the pace of a sloth on sedatives, with pointless detours, irrelevant side characters, and enough flashbacks to make your head spin. I've seen snails move faster than the plot of this anime. The world-building is also laughable. A nonsensical mishmash of pirate clichés, fantastical creatures, and bizarre abilities that make no logical sense whatsoever. I get it, it's a fantasy world, but at least make it internally consistent. It's like the writers throw in whatever random idea they come up with, without any thought to how it fits into the larger narrative. Oh, and the characters? Don't even get me started. Luffy, the main character, is a brain-dead buffoon with all the depth of a puddle. He's so one-dimensional that I'm surprised he doesn't disappear when he turns sideways. The rest of the crew isn't any better – a bunch of forgettable tropes that you've seen a million times before in better anime. The dialogue... ugh. It's a cringe-fest of cheesy one-liners, predictable speeches about friendship and dreams, and enough shouting to make your eardrums bleed. I've seen more nuanced conversations on a playground full of screaming toddlers. In conclusion, ""One Piece"" is a colossal waste of time and brain cells. It's an assault on the senses, an insult to storytelling, and a blight on the anime world. If you value your sanity, stay as far away from this abomination as possible.

"I believe the only redeeming trait of One piece is that it has good world building that serves as a driving force to keep the story interesting for so long. The animation is bad and so are some of the designs; though this does interplay with the mood that the story portrays, lighthearted and cheerful. I personally found this part of the story off putting because I feel that One piece can serve various age ranges. It is clear that the style is overly exaggerated when it comes to the lighthearted, bright and cheerful designs to reach a younger age range. This makes the setting sort of stale as every place the characters visit the mood doesn't change. This draws the attention that we used to have on the setting away because the adventurous islands became normal to the story. This isn't exactly bad though because it is part of the worlds style as an adventurous and wild world it helped establish a feel. Sound: This is more about dialouge. ANNOYING CHARACTERS at first. As stated in the previous section the story makes veiwers get used to parts of the story. I HATED the characters at first I had to get 500 episodes into the story to get used to the character troupes and traits to the point I enjoyed them. Don't like characters Only thing good about the characters are comedic aspects and if there are good characters like Doflomingo or Whitbeard they aren't well rounded. The characters usually have one good thing about them shown and are not developed any further. STALE CHARACTERS My favorite character is Bartolemeo for those who have watched One peice I hate Nami I like Sanji I sorta like Zoro I like Brook I hate Chopper I'm iffy about Segoking (wish Ussopin had joined again) Dislike Franky (only because he does not get enough screentime/action ) No feeling about the sushi Don't like anything about Luffy most of the time don't care bout ROOOBIIINN-SWAAAANNNN I love the Going Merry Hated pacing, fights, conflicts and pretty much every stupid moment happening for the sake of conflict that should've been easily ended or prevented.

"This review will cover the first “half” of one piece (Ep 1-516) just so you can tell what period this is based on but I won’t give any spoilers so calm down. Let me start by saying my first introduction to one piece was through the 4kids dub and I have to say I didn’t mind it. Of course a few years later when I watched the original subbed version it really shows the major flaws with the 4kids version luckily I didn’t get too far into it. I have seen some of the FUNimation episodes and for those of you who do prefer English dub that would be the way to go. Now for the review… Story: One piece’s story is one of the best constructed anime series around, you watch it back and you can pick up references to people or events over 400 episodes in the future… that’s a well thought out story line. You see Luffy grow from a young child to a capable captain of a crew, dreaming of being king of the pirates! It’s not only Luffy that has a goal, every crew member has their own dream and these are explored as well. Each member of the Straw Hat crew is a main character, while not being as focused as Luffy, you see everybody’s backstory making every person someone you become attached to. One of the best features of this series is that it can deliver on the paths it chooses either if it’s a more fantasy styled setting like Skypiea or a hectic battlefield at Marineford each setting works in the one piece universe and the emotional connection you end up getting towards each character makes the comedy/heartbreak/success/failure of each plot a gripping one. Art: Honestly, when I first started watching it I didn’t enjoy the art style compared to other animes and a lot of the people I showed it to at that time had similar opinions but once you watch it for a bit it grows on you and you wouldn’t want to have it any other way. The way Oda has drawn the characters really has given him the opportunity to throw some very “unique” looking characters into the mix in the future episodes without them seeming out of place. Sound: The music and sound effects are perfect, if you watch the first OVA of One Piece you can hear the dominant sound of rubber being stretched every time Luffy makes an attack, while good for effect they made it look like it took a lot of effort in order to stretch. The anime series changed this making the sound not as harsh and as a result it makes the action more free-flowing. The music itself sets the mood exactly like it should and the times where a song you know becomes dominant in the series when something is about to go down really increases the effect the scene has one you. The voice actors also do a terrific job of conveying the right tone and volume for each scene. Conclusion: In the end I base my scores on how much enjoyment I felt while watching each series and in this series 10/10! And I don’t like giving out 10s but from the amount of wondrous time one piece has given me… it’s worth it and you should definitely watch it. First review, any feedback would be good to help improve future reviews. Thanks for reading.",10,Recommended,"Dec 10, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_86ebbeaf4e,4,3068
"The Story - It starts out feeling Cliche with &quot;im gonna be king of the pirates&quot; by finding one piece! but really the story more revolves around Luffy wanting to go on adventures and if there's one thing that One Piece delivers on its the feeling of a huge world and a very very Epic adventure that you are almost not gonna get in any other anime. The Art - alot of people do not like the art style of one piece. but i myself find it very unique, so you actually feel like you're watching something very different in a very good way. The Sound - One Piece, in my opinion, has some of the very best japanese voice actors and the music in it is just phenomenal when something big happens you know its something big because the music that goes along with the show complements it all so well. Characters - unlike what seems to be the current standard of emo main characters and clingy annoying girls, this show breaks away from all of that using a very enthusiastic main character, and instead of a girl a clingy guy that is handled in a comedic manner instead of annoying. This show also has possibly the best character development of characters in any anime i have ever seen. when you watch the show you real get to feel like you know the character instead of just watching them. Enjoyment - You may look at the length of the show (which when this is written was almost 400) and say &quot;I'd prolly get bored watching such a long anime&quot; but this is not the case as the show just gets better the further you get. Overall - this anime is a must see for anyone who likes anime. and do not, i repeat, DO NOT watch the 4kids Dub, watch the sub, or else its a whole different experience.",10,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2008",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b51c0b0f09,4,1694
"""A man's dream will never die"" When I started my venture into anime, there were three shows that I told myself that I was not going to watch: Bleach, Naruto, and One Piece. This is because these three show have one thing in common: They're still on the air. Watching a lot of anime is as bad as it sounds, but watching something and trying to catch up with is even worse. Plus, I mocked these three series for their appeal to the younger crowd. Then, suddenly I was told that One Piece, the childish-looking one out of them all, is actually the best out of all of them. To be honest, I always thought One Piece was the butchered piece of crap that was presented to me by 4Kids when I was younger. Then I found out that Funimation picked it up and re-dubbed it when 4Kids went out of business. I watched the first episode of Funimation dub...I have now seen all 10 movies, 430 episodes, and watched most of the OVAs. In other words, One Piece is one of the greatest and most addicting animes of all time. How could a show that I once regarded as juvenile be masterful? Well, first off it's not juvenile, in fact it's quite brutal. At first, it's starts off normal. We are introduced to our protagonist, the carefree and determined Monkey D. Luffy, the self-proclaimed future king of the pirates. He seeks to achieve this goal by forming the best pirate crew, sail the whole world, and find the legendary treasure, the One Piece. This is our first step into the brilliance of this show. Luffy, while not the brightest person and well-mannered person, is the character we as the audience want to look up to. While some can debate that his decisions always tend to cause destruction and violence, it's that utter lack of not having fear that chills go down my spine. It's the idea that we must go on our own adventures in life and pursue our dreams even if others say that they're dead and unreachable. However, we've all seen this story before right? There have been numerous stories about going the distance and following our dreams. What makes One Piece so different then? If I were to summarized One Piece in one line then it would be this: One Piece cuts the bull shit. Most stories about going the distance always have that one point where the characters give up or something happens that prevents and then something happens that suddenly makes them want to move forward. One Piece...there is no such thing. One Piece is all about becoming stronger. Stronger to stand up for the people you care for, stronger to advance on your journey, stronger to be ready for that final goal. This is One Piece's true accomplishment. The show also has a strong sense of humor. There are so many times where I have chuckled and even laughed out loud from the comedy of this show. Even if it's running gags such as Zoro's lack of direction or Sanji's weakness for beautiful women, there is always something fresh and some sort of new take on it. This leads me to my next point. One Piece not only emits happiness and laughter, but all other emotions as well. Emotions such as sadness, fear, hope, love, and sometimes even anger. We as the audience feel this because our main characters feel it as well. I can say that you will probably find something about yourself in the form of these characters. For example, like Luffy, I have always have had tried to fight for that one dream. Like Sanji, while his actions are exaggerated a bit, even I have to admit that I have always catered to woman's needs more than men. Like Usopp, I have always have felt like the weakest of group, the one who is inferior compared to my stronger peers. Like Robin, I have always felt like the one who was misunderstood, the one who has been labeled by society as this type of person. One Piece shows that sometimes it's okay to be different because even when the whole world is against you, there are people who will stand by your side and will fight to protect you. These character only then are brought to life by the people who play them. I have seen the first 205 episodes in English and it shows off what Funimation does best and makes up for what 4Kids did. After that, I switched from the English, as new dubbed episodes are coming out later this year, to the Japanese track where the voice acting is also top notch. It was interesting to know that some seiyuus here are actually well known. For example, Chopper's seiyuu is Pikachu, Zoro's seiyuu is Mugen from Samurai Champloo, and the one that I think that a lot of you are going shocked by is that Usopp is voiced by Kappei Yamguchi, the voice of L and older Detective Conan. Right now I have been introduced to the character Boa Hancock and her seiyuu is Kotono Mitsuishi, the original voice Sailor Moon, the voice of Misato from Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Excel Excel from what else than Excel Saga. The voice actors do amazing jobs in both languages giving some truly powerful performances. It should also be addressed that the score to One Piece is unforgettable. The music of One Piece not only matches great anime scores such as Cowboy Bebop's or the original FMA anime, but even stacks up to John Williams and Danny Elfman film scores. Trust me when I say that after watching the show for a long time, background music will become so familiar to which you will start humming plus also indicating the type of situation that lies ahead. The animation of One Piece is also something of noteworthy. Unlike, traditional animes, the animation of One Piece is more of like of that of a combination of old animes, American cartoons, and in the hi-res episodes like that of conventional animes from today. In a way, it's a something of it's own style, probably the one thing that will make anime fans, who are used to animes looking like shows such as Haruhi Suzumiya, not want to watch to this show. However, the cartoonish visuals of One Piece only makes it unique from everything else. While we do see some carbon copies of characters here and there, not often does a character look like another character and have the same personality. I tell you one thing, I have to admit while characters like Nami or Robin or any of the women in this show do have ridiculous anime proportions, it only makes me wonder are there woman in the world that possibly exist (oh it's times like this that hate that I'm a geek). However, this also allows me to say what you should know when watching it. Do not question anything that happens. I know that's a weird thing to say considering that ""no duh it's a cartoon it shouldn't be taken seriously."" However, I say this because the thing is the show keeps you so invested that you forget that a lot of wacky cartoonish things occur and some animes of this nature like to take themselves seriously when they shouldn't. Luckily, the show is aware of itself and often makes meta jokes about the characters and the situations that occur. I have seen a lot animes and the ones that I consider my personal favorites I wish have lasted longer than just 26 or 51 episodes. One Piece, on the other hand is still running to this day and to be honest when that day comes, it's going to be sad seeing the final adventure of the Strawhats. I love One Piece, it moves away from the standard conventional ideas and gives them the middle finger. Damsel in Distress, screw that, we already have two ladies that that can kick ass. Living by government rules to which One Piece answers, ""there is no honor in the government, it's full a people stubborn people who only do it for the sake of following orders."" What about villains? Clearly all of them have the same personality right? ""who is the real villain here, is it the government hunting the pirates, is it the other pirates, or it could it possibly be Luffy and the rest of the Strawhat Crew who are the real villains here?"" One Piece on the surface may look like the average shounen but deep down there is something more than just skinny yet large chested women and cool action fights. I'll just say this right now: One Piece is the first anime that made me cry. More than Wolf's Rain, Clannad, and Grave of the Fireflies. One Piece will be and should be remembered among anime fans as something as a tale of hopes and dreams. If you have not seen One Piece, then there is no better time than to start watching now. How can I put this: If you wanted to choose out of the big three (four if you include now Fairy Tail) shounens, then One Piece is your answer. I love it and I swear you are going to love it as well.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_32495ff687,4,8514
"I would not reccomend one piece the anime, but I would reccomend the manga. Good: Characters - One piece has some of the best written characters I have seen in anime Humour - maybe not at the first few arcs, but one piece has made me genuinely laugh a few times, which is more than I can say for most anime Plot - It might feel repetitive when you go through arcs and there are new people to save and whatnot, but it gets super intricate and I love how everything is connected Bad: Pacing - the pacing is so terrible in the anime it is borderline unwatchable. All of the goods of this show are null in front of this point. If you want to watch the anime, you should watch ""one pace"" (a fan made version that cuts out unnecessary scenes like reaction shots) You have to wait a bit until it gets good - At least in my opinion, I felt like the arcs betweeen episodes 50-250 just kind of sucked.

"I absolutely must write a review for One Piece because it's my favorite anime to date. Shonen-action wise, I think that One Piece easily beats competitors such as Naruto and Bleach. (Apparently, in Japan, it has sales that outrank Naruto and Bleach combined? That's quite the opposite of its status in America lol) Anyways, One Piece is an epic anime series. It has the awesome fighting that a shonen fan needs, it has an EPIC storyline, great character designs, (I love basically every character that Oda introduces other than the villians he makes that readers are suppose to hate so that when he gets his ass kick it'll be so much more satisfying, of course) an awesome awesome soundtrack, lots of intense drama, and just overall greatness. I even enjoyed *most* of the fillers; I felt that they were somewhat on par with the canon.

"There are stories, and then there is One Piece. To call it a masterpiece feels like an understatement—it’s a phenomenon that stands as a towering testament to the limitless power of storytelling. Eiichiro Oda hasn’t just written a manga or inspired an anime; he’s built a living, breathing universe that beats with the heart of its fans. This is more than fiction. It’s a legacy. At the center of it all is Monkey D. Luffy—a boy with a straw hat and a dream so audacious it shakes the very foundations of his world. Luffy isn’t just a character; he’s a movement, a spirit that reminds us to laugh, to cry, and to fight for what we believe in. His pursuit of the Pirate King’s crown isn’t about treasure—it’s about freedom, friendship, and carving your place in a world that constantly tells you “no.” But Luffy isn’t alone. The Straw Hat crew isn’t just a group of allies—they are a family forged in blood, tears, and unshakable resolve. Zoro, the steadfast swordsman with a will as sharp as his blade. Nami, whose navigation skills steer them toward hope even when her heart has weathered storms of betrayal. Sanji, balancing his culinary artistry with a penchant for chivalry. Robin, Franky, Usopp, Brook, Jinbei, and Chopper—all of them are dreamers who have dared to defy a world that tried to break them. Yet it’s not just the characters that make One Piece extraordinary—it’s the world they inhabit. Oda has built a universe so detailed, so intricate, it feels like it’s been waiting for us to discover it. The Grand Line is alive: from the bustling ports of Water 7 to the haunting majesty of Thriller Bark, from the skybound wonder of Skypiea to the war-torn beauty of Dressrosa. Every island tells a story, and every story leaves you in awe of Oda’s genius. And the themes—oh, the themes! Dreams. Freedom. Sacrifice. Justice. The weight of history and the unrelenting march of time. Oda threads these ideas together with surgical precision, creating a narrative tapestry that is at once epic and deeply personal. He doesn’t just want you to watch; he wants you to feel. The laughter of a crewmate. The sting of a betrayal. The crushing weight of Ace’s final words: “Thank you for loving me.” The writing is a masterclass in foreshadowing. Events you barely notice in one arc explode into life hundreds of chapters later. The emotional payoffs are staggering—every tear you shed, every laugh you share with the Straw Hats is earned. And let’s not forget the animation. Over the years, Toei Animation has turned One Piece into a visual marvel. From the iconic Gear Fifth reveal to the raw emotional devastation of Marineford, the series transforms panels into moments that make your heart race and your soul soar. One Piece isn’t just peak anime or peak manga. It’s the peak of human creativity. It reminds us that dreams are worth chasing, no matter how impossible they seem. It shows us that freedom isn’t something you’re given—it’s something you take. For over 1,000 episodes and counting, One Piece has stood as a lighthouse in the vast ocean of storytelling. And as we sail closer to the shores of its conclusion, one thing is clear: no matter what the One Piece turns out to be, we’ve already found the treasure. 10/10. Peakkkkkkkkk.",10,Recommended,"Jan 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ec578c2f45,5,3247
"So I wanted to do an updated review of the mainline series because I have some new thoughts about it but I couldn’t do that unless I deleted my OG review which I didn’t wanna do. So I decided to post my updated review first from 4/17/2025 where I was on episode 1125 and then at the bottom is my OG review from 04/02/2024 where I was on episode 1099 just letting you all know. And don’t worry I’ll separate both parts so as not to confuse y'all. ---04/17/2025 (1125/? episodes) So ever since One Piece returned from its hiatus about a week ago, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. And the more I do think about it, the more I realize how much of a fan I am of it. It’s really the one shounen that I can think of where it was hard for me to get into at first, but once I hunkered down and decided to lock in, it would only grow on me and win me over, which is a phenomenon that fans like me call: “The One Piece Effect.” You know that one episode from SpongeBob where Squidward was hating on the Krabby Patty and didn’t wanna try it, but then he takes this teeny tiny bite out of it, then says it wasn’t good, but next thing you know he’s eating so many Krabby Patties that it’s making him fat af? Well that analogy has been pretty much my experience with One Piece. Now I wasn’t hating on it like Squidward but I only thought it was ok and I didn’t have the strongest feelings for it at first. And I’ve said this before, but I was even thinking of dropping the series entirely. But now that I’ve caught up with the anime and have been watching it weekly for about a year now, I can look back at that time and laugh at it, because I'm now grateful that I've stuck with this series through thick and thin. This is easily the longest I’ve ever been with any TV show that I’ve watched, and watching this show weekly has pretty much become a part of my daily life. Now the consensus that I’ve heard from manga readers is that the pacing is worse in the anime compared to how it is in the manga. Which is why there are websites like One Pace, which is a fan made project that cuts out filler scenes from the anime to try to make it more in line with Oda’s original work. And you may not believe me when I say this, but I had no idea websites like this existed until I had already caught up with the OG anime. Yeah I was watching the normal ass episodes that apparently had worse pacing for the longest time and once I found out about this, I thought: “Wow, that could’ve saved me sooo much time. Too bad I’m already caught up!” And I do have one big complaint with this series but it’s really a personal issue and nothing against the series itself, but there is so much shit to keep track of and remember with this series that it is just overwhelming for me. Now don’t get me wrong, this is great cause it gives the audience a lot and I mean a lot to chew on and digest. The word building and attention to detail that this series has is really second to none. But as someone who doesn’t have the best memory and as long as this show is, it’s a guarantee that I’ll forget some character names and lore. However, the special thing about this series is that just when you have forgotten a plot point or character that may have happened/appeared 100 episodes or more earlier, or in real time, these things may have occured fucking YEARS ago, the series will remind you of that moment or piece of lore at the appropriate time which is very cool and that does help with my memory a bit. And it kinda blows my mind that a slow burning series like this is as popular and mainstream as it is. And like it or not One Piece is one of the most influential and culturally significant anime/manga of our time. Recently they’ve collabed with sports teams like the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles Lakers, the ladder of which featuring my glorious King LeBron James. There was the live-action One Piece adaptation on Netflix which was quite successful and that I found to be a pleasant surprise. There’s The One Piece which is the anime remake by Wit Studio that’s said to be more in line with the manga but idk when that’s coming out. I’ve even heard that there’s a freaking stage play at Universal Studios Japan and even a future attraction coming soon since the show is THE anime in Japan, it’s practically worshipped there. And of course, there’s One Piece skins in Fortnite, which I don’t even like Fortnite but once a fictional or even a nonfictional character gets a skin in Fortnite, that’s when you know they’ve made it into the modern mainstream audience. So to say that fans have been eating in recent years is really an understatement. And as for me, even though I’ve been eating the main course I wanted to taste a little of the side dishes if you know what I mean. So I’ve been watching a few of the OP movies, at least the ones that most people consider to be good. Even tho they’re not canon I think they’re fun little distractions. I’ve also been playing a few of the games, and when I say a few of the games, I mean only like one game, and that's Pirate Warriors 4. Because I've heard most fans say that it's one of the better OP game while the rest aren't as enjoyable which is understandable since most anime games for the longest time have been known for being either mid or ass say for a few exceptions. So overall, while I still think Hunter x Hunter is my personal favorite shounen of all time, One Piece has been doing a great job filling the void that the HxH anime left behind for me, because at this point I’ve accepted that the HxH anime is not going to return anytime soon but at least the manga is still being published, very slowly that is. So with that info, I’d say One Piece is now a close second as far as shounen goes. While I don't think it's perfect (I mean no anime is perfect), I’ve realized that I've given anime 10s with more flaws than this one, plus the positives in this series still outweigh the negatives and I’ve never seen a TV show with THIS many episodes being more consistent than One Piece. Keep up the good work Oda! 😊👍 ---04/02/2025 (1099/? episodes) If you ask me, One Piece is one (no pun intended) of the most fun anime I have ever seen. Those are the best words I can use to describe it: it’s just…so fun. But unfortunately, I don’t think I would recommend it to first-time anime viewers. Mostly because it’s obviously a pretty daunting show clocking in with over 1000 episodes, in fact the longest story arc as of now (that being Wano Kuni) is approximately 208 episodes! Like, damn. But despite its intimidating reputation, I think once you have a little more experience with anime and if you are a more patient viewer who’s willing to give it a try, I think you’ll find something very approachable and rewarding. But on the other hand, I also think that this is the one shounen that’s just not gonna be for everyone. Because I remember back when I first took the plunge with this series, I thought to myself: “Man, this show is slow and boring!” Yeah, I just wasn’t feeling it at first, it wasn’t my jam. I wouldn’t say it was bad or anything, I just thought it was ok at best. But I was kind of turned off by a lot of things in this show, from the artstyle and humor which is all very cartoony and childish to the kind of annoying characters, I’m looking at you Luffy. And I wasn’t really watching it as much as other shows, movies, etc at the time and I was thinking of dropping it multiple times. But I was still willing to give the show a chance because it’s so popular and beloved and I wanted to know why that is. And I think it was at the point where once I started the Alabasta arc (episode 62), I began to realize: “Wait a minute, this show is actually kinda good.” And the more I watched it from that point, the more this show began to grow on me and win me over. To the point where after Robin had her iconic moment during Enies Lobby, I was like: “Goddamit, I love this show now.” And I have been riding with it without turning back ever since. It was like my third eye was opening just a little bit more with each arc and I was gradually beginning to see Oda's vision for how insane but also creative this series can be. And the aspects that I didn’t fuck with at first started to grow on me in a big way, like the art style and humor. Which yes, the humor is your typical over-the-top anime humor which isn’t really my thing, but I began to realize that this type of humor fits like a glove with this art style that’s so colorful and distinct and also weirdly nostalgic, because it kind of reminds me of cartoons that I used to watch as a kid. Another thing that began to grow on me were the characters, specifically the titular Straw Hat captain himself: Monkey D. Luffy. Who at first I thought was the most annoying character in the whole show, and while I do think he kind of stays the same headstrong and food-obsessed boy that we have seen at the beginning of the show, he does actually become more of a badass throughout the narrative. There is this one moment that really stood out to me during Fishman Island where Jimbei tells him that he needs to be more responsible as a captain instead of just dicking around all the time and getting his crew in danger since at that point in the show, that's what he's been doing as a captain. But then Luffy reveals that he is aware of that responsibility but he'd just rather take his chances and see what happens since for him it's more fun that way. Uh, alright, I'll accept that answer I guess. I wouldn’t exactly say it’s character development as much as it is character progression. And this goes for every Straw Hat crew member. Now I have heard the complaint that this show has no tension because all the Straw Hats survive every predicament they are in. And yeah, you’re right, but there’s still plenty of tension in this show. It just chooses to use the environment for tension instead of what will happen to our main protagonists. Like in Alabasta or Wano where the Straw Hats have to save a country from a cold-blooded ruler, or anything that happens in Marineford. If you don’t think this show has tension or stakes, well then I don’t know what to tell you. As far as my favorite characters in this series, the one character that I easily liked from first impressions alone is Chopper. Who is just so goddamn cute and adorable that I’m tempted to buy a stuffed animal of him off of Amazon. He kind of reminds me of Shippo from InuYasha but if he was less annoying, more interesting and contributed more to the Straw Hats success, since he is the doctor of the crew. So yeah, he might be my spirit animal and I also strangely really like Robin. Not because she’s hot…ok maybe because she’s kind of hot but y’know she’s a cool character, she’s got enjoyable qualities if you know what I mean lol. But seriously, I feel like she has one of the more interesting backstories out of the Straw Hats, and I also love how she acts kind of motherly towards Chopper, like it always warms my heart when those two are together. Oh, and she’s an archeologist, which reminds me of Indiana Jones, which is a major plus for me because I get really nostalgic and giddy when something reminds me of Indiana Jones. One thing I respect about One Piece is how despite this show looking very cartoonish and colorful, it’s never afraid to get depressing and even kinda violent. I also love the theme of found family which I think is pretty universal and is most likely one of the traits that has led to this series' widespread appeal. Another thing I respect is the animation, or at least how it evolves. I even once thought: “You know maybe the animation will stagnate because there’s so many episodes.” But that is absolutely not the case here. In fact, the animation actually improves with each passing arc. To the point where once I got to Wano Kuni, I started thinking: “Where did this animation come from?” Yeah I’ll just say that Wano is easily without question the best animated story arc that we’ve gotten so far and I’ll just leave it there. I did mention that Wano is the longest arc in this show and I’ve said this before but I'll say it again, I’m not the biggest fan of long arcs. I’ve said why in some other reviews but when it comes to this show, long story arcs are its specialty and kind of something you have to accept. This series is very much trying to be a slow burn compared to other shounen and I respect that. From the continuity to the subtle foreshadowing to of course the world building that’s always on point. Oda really has the nerve to make each arc better than the last one. How he even comes up with some of this shit is beyond me because like I said before, this show is just insane. Even during the beginning of some arcs, I would be thinking: “Yeah, this isn’t really that interesting to me, maybe this arc will be one of the weaker ones.” The story will get flipped on its head out of nowhere to make me engaged again. A prime example of what I’m talking about is during the end of Sabaody, if you know you know. Now as I am typing this review, I consider myself a very casual One Piece enjoyer. Like I only watch the mainline series, I don’t watch any of the movies, or read the manga. And for some reason, manga readers seem to hate the anime and I wasn’t really sure why so I decided to look into it and it mostly just has to do with the business model of the anime. People just complain that the pacing is worse compared to the manga. I don’t know, I feel like this personally doesn’t concern me because I’ve never read the manga. I’m sure the manga is great but I don’t really read much manga. That’s why a lot of manga is adapted to anime because most people just don’t like to read, me included. I mean you always hear the “manga is better” excuse whenever a new anime comes out. To the point where I just have to ask: Why even watch anime at all when people are just gonna say that the manga is better? Anyway, I would talk more about this show, but then I would be getting into spoilers. But even though this show has grown on me a lot since I first started watching it, I still do have a few critiques. For one, I think the animation from East Blue to Skypiea has really not aged well which is probably why they're going back and redoing them. Plus this show does have its fair share of filler episodes but compared to other shounen that’s over a 100 episodes, there’s surprisingly very little of them despite this show being super long so it’s not the biggest deal breaker in the world. Also some of the fan service can be a little distracting at times even if my intrusive thoughts say otherwise. Another thing is that as much as I like Zoro and Sanji as characters, their pissing contest has started to become a little played out, especially since I have seen more than 1000 episodes of this show and those two still have beef with one another. I assume they are going to squash their differences in the end but who knows. Oh another thing that’s become played out is Sanji being a simp for women. Now I get that’s like his main joke and flaw as a character but when I think of down bad anime characters, Sanji is usually in the top five, and that’s not a good thing. Although I will say at some points I can definitely sympathize with why he violently nosebleeds over the sight of some of these women because…y’know…who wouldn’t do backflips for some of the women in this show? Yeah, this show can get kind of horny at a lot of points. I feel like Oda purposely drew some of their knockers almost bigger than their head just to fuck with us straight men. Am I being weird? I’ll move on. And the last nitpick that I have is that the story arcs are kind of the same to me. Not that they feel the same, but they are more so structured the same. They usually follow this pattern: The Straw Hats arrive on an island, shenanigans ensue on the island, and the arc usually ends with Luffy fighting the main bad guy. There are obviously exceptions to this, but that’s kind of how most of the story arcs play out and I kinda wish there could be a little more variety although this series does do a good job at masking the similarities of other arcs to help you not notice. But despite this, there really isn't a bad arc in this series to me. Yeah I guess arcs like Fishman Island are a little weak and pale in comparison to the best arcs but I wouldn't say they're terrible like other people have said. So even if this series does have some flaws and it isn’t exactly my favorite shounen ever, I cannot deny that it still absolutely rocks and I think the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. I’ll probably continue to watch it for years to come and I’m glad that I have stuck with this show for as long as I have because if I dropped it, I feel like I might have regretted it. I have no idea when this show is gonna end but god dammit I’ll say that it can go on for as long as it wants, just if it continues to keep a consistent level of quality and I hope to be there when it does end. I know the Big Three (One Piece, Naruto and Bleach) isn’t really a thing anymore, but I definitely see why most people call this the best one out of the three because it kind of is. It’s the most creative, the most colorful, and the most planned out. Again, I don’t think it’s a masterpiece for me but I can still see why people call it “peak fiction."" So for now, I'll probably give it a 9/10.",10,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6c2f271835,5,17443

"I think I can overlook the cons of this show because it's pros outweigh it by a lot. First off, I commend Toei for being able to consistently drop episodes weekly for the last 25 years, with animation that never ceases to disappoint. That's one of the pros. Another is it's excellent world building. I think it's got the best world building for any show ever. There are over 1000 characters and each of them have enough depth (for their roles). Everyone is accounted for and no one gets left behind or forgotten in the story. Another one of it's pros is the insane story telling and the depth the story goes into, particularly the foreshadowing. Nearly everything has a meaning in One Piece, and it will always lead to something big later on in the story. That takes me to my next point, the mysteries surrounding the show. It keeps the viewer always wanting to know what happens next. The story baffles and mindfuckes the viewer when the viewer realises the connections between mysteries and previous events to the later parts in the story. Another great aspect of the show is how well developed the characters are. They each have deep backstories that really connect the watchers to the characters on a personal level. One Piece does a really good job at advancing a characters progress in arcs where it makes sense. They don't force progression just because other characters are progressing. Be advised, this is peak. Be prepared to cry and to be amazed with this show.",10,Recommended,"Sep 1, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_244ea4a515,5,1472
"I started watching this anime when was showing in Cartoon Network back there and then I found out about the 4kids nonsense so I switched to Japanese anime, this is the first anime I watched in its original language and I was enjoying it, until I guess the Skypea season, I think this is where it went down hill or maybe it was since the beginning and I just figured it out, anyway... I started to get frustrated by the pacing of the chapters, the same thing made me not like Dragon Ball, the feeler in the chapters that ruins the pacing I hate it, I that Toei stretch the emotion scenes so much. It makes it unbearable. But what made me drop the anime was the fandom, I know you can be passionate about it (I'm a unapologetically fanboy of Naruto and I like Boruto FIGHT ME!!!!) But I understand the critics this anime has and I still enjoy Kishimoto's work, but with One Piece, I just can't comprehend how unhinged they get when I complain about the pacing of the anime. They get mad. Funny thing, those are the same reasons I don't like Dragon Ball either, interesting, another Toei anime... I don't hate Toei, they made Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon, Yu☆Gi☆Oh!, Digimon, etc. which makes me very frustrated Read the manga, let's see the reboot by Wit studio how will go, hope they fix this",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 18, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0622f3f0ce,5,1287

"*Spoiler Free Review* One Piece is an Anime about Pirates, Mainly one crew of Pirates called ""Straw Hats"". It is a action adventure anime, where the characters have special powers and are super strong. The Main storyline isn't that amazing, It's typical boy has a dream, boy goes out to obtain said dream, but what is amazing is the side storys that mixes into the main story, and there are tons, most of these are character background or goals, but it all fits in very nice, due to how big the One Piece world is, and how well the characters are devolped. The main reason I gave Story a 7 is due to the real main story, it's been done tons of times. The artwork and animation in this Anime gets alot of negitave response, but on the whole i'd say its average, its not rubbish by any standard, and sometimes has some very nice effects, But it's not the best out there. Don't be put off by the people who list the animation as why one piece sucks, because its the most stupidest thing ever, people still play old video games and watch old anime, do people complain about the graphics/ animation in them? No. The Sound is this Anime is epic, The Voice actors are very good at their jobs eppeically Zoro and Luffy. The Music is full of epic win! Most of all, all of the sound effects sound like the real thing, which is always a good thing, you know somethings up when a sword sounds like a wet fish hiting a rock. The Characters are very well devolped, even the majority of the lesser know characters have somewhat of a devolped background and continue to devolpe in the anime, something most animes don't have. I like that One piece does this, as it adds to the well written universe the creators have made, and it also allows the One Piece world to expand. To finish things off, the amount of enjoyment i get out of this anime has only ever been rivaled by Death Note, comparing it to other animes of the same genre however, nothing has came close to topping how well everything in One piece goes, and sometimes I hope that the show will never end, because I find it that much of an enjoyment to watch. So go check it out, if it sounds intresting to you, if not, well i guess my review skills suck, and you should go read a diffrent one piece review :P",9,Recommended,"May 14, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_331c821c93,5,2252
"SPOILERLESS REVIEW: I don't know what to type in this review to not get One piece fans upset but I'll say this, One piece isn't bad but in my perspective it isn't good either, it's in the middle or what you call mid, I can understand why people call this ""good"" or even ""great"" but it seems to me that people have become too carried away and started saying things like no piece of fiction comes close to One piece and Oda's writing is perfect and all mangaka or authors are inferior to him which is false and shows people's ignorance and sheep like mindsets that caused One piece to become a toxic ""cult"" like fandom, this doesn't include 100% of the fandom but still a scary majority of them. Now I'll go over the review which I'd go over various categories and what I think: Characters: The characters in one piece are very simple with surface level depth, we can see that Oda didn't think too hard while drawing and writing them, when Oda writes a new character into one piece I can imagine It going like this: first he thinks of a design that looks wacky and ugly or deformed or funny or cool or sexy or anything that isn't a normal human being with normal anatomy, the designs are easy to draw despite their attempt to stand out and look unique, some of the characters are circle with limbs or with a head 3x the size of their body or with any other features that stand out , the designs stand out but aren't ""creative"" or something that requires thinking, just pick up the pen and everything goes basically, secondly after getting a design he gives them a personality that most of the time resembles their designs making them act as goofy as they look, they mostly have a ""gag"" that even if heaven and earth flipped they wouldn't mature and stop using that ""gag"", what I mean by ""gag"" is a certain personality, act, laugh, way to talk, traits that are common with all shounens anime like killer bee's rapping from naruto, sanji's degeneracy, luffy's stupidness and obsession with eating meat, etc. those ""gags"" aren't always a bad thing, but with Oda's overuse of them he creates himself a cast of characters that are bland and static, they don't develop anywhere, they can be ""funny"" but never interesting, and the lack of character development shows a big flaw in Oda's writing, static characters are easy to digest but fail to leave an impression, you can know what they are going to say or do 99% of the time, the lack of dynamic characters in one piece and the overuse of painfully static ones is easily visible, dynamic characters are the characters that change as they grow and do things that change the course and direction the plot is going, they are deep, unexpected, and as long as they are on screen you don't know what they are going to be or do 1 episode later, dynamic characters are needed and are hard for an author to write because of the thin line between character development and character assassination. It's easy to write a character knowing what it will do for the rest of the story. a show that focuses on being easy to digest will be childish with the depth of a kids show no matter what gory themes like slavery, racism may appear in the show, Oda gives some of his characters a finale touch with a backstory, in my opinion one piece backstories are mostly repetitive tear jerkers despite some good ones, the backstories mostly have one thing in common, either some of the character's loved ones died in an accidents or some dictator or government killed them, even the ones that don't fall under this category are forgettable and fail to touch me or connect me with the character emotionally, backstories also doesn't equal character development, those are different aspects of writing and can't cover on one another's flaws. Plot: the plot of one piece has a loop of a crying girl, dictator, fight , repeat with some standouts here and there, one of the most dominating theme in one piece is corruption, the theme revolves around evil dictators, governments, pirates commiting injustice with the power and influence they have to reach a selfish goal or desire. Here is how the loop goes: the straw hats pirates are a group of pirates devoting their trust and faith in a captain named Monkey D Luffy, they go to their goal which is the finale island to find the one piece and help Luffy achieve his dream (by the previous category you know my opinion about the characters and how they are written), they stop midway in islands to get clues on the poneglyphs which reveal where the one piece is, on those island there is always some signs of a problem or corruption going on, the straw hat pirates split up and meet a girl who will cry to luffy to stop the dictator, then she will go on about why Luffy doesn't have any reason to help and then a dramatic music will play and he will say ""I'll help you!"" then they run for 50 episodes to reach the finale boss spawn area with 100 of flashbacks and then they are in a state where Zoro fight the boss's right hand, sanji fights the left hand and the fodders go for all the other crew members, then Luffy reaches to the boss and says: ""there you are, I'll beat you!"" and the boss says: ""you have no chance"", and the fight starts with Luffy getting clapped till he says: ""I saved this power for last"" and then proceeds pull an asspull out of nowhere then the boss says ""impossible"" and Luffy lands the finale attack and everyone is happy. Repeat. World: the world of one piece consists of 2 lines with monothematic islands each island referencing a real place or a fairy tale theme. The world is very fun and unique and a plus to the show, there are various places across those 2 lines like a sky island, underwater island, elephant island , a palace of gods (mary jose) and a world government filled with history on the 100 year void. The world has a ton of history and mysteries and is infinitely expanding, that is probably the best part of one piece and what kept me watching despite bland characters and poor plot decisions. The world has depth the characters sadly do not. In summary: one piece isn't bad but is held back by poor writing and characters and has a great world. I don't think I'm some harvard graduate that knows better than everybody else and I don't even know if this review is good or not, I'm just expressing my opinion on a show I watched that wasn't for me + I wanted to go over more categories but I think that is enough to express my opinion about one piece. Hope you enjoyed.",5,Not Recommended,"Dec 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5d627c76c1,5,6482
"I used to like One Piece a lot until the Whole Cake Island Arc, but from that point on, the anime seemed too childish. I think my opinion changed after watching other anime where the main character has a decent level of intelligence and delivers a final blow to defeat the enemy instead of chit-chatting. In One Piece, they often waste time talking, allowing enemies to return and cause more trouble later. That said, if you are new to anime, you will most likely love it, just like I did. However, if you’ve watched many other series where the protagonist acts decisively and doesn’t hesitate to finish off an enemy, you might find One Piece frustrating. I’ll probably watch a story recap after one or two years when the series is complete.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c736dcae47,5,741

"I just don't get why this anime is one of the most popular and loved ones of all time. I'll give my objective opinion. The thing that I like most about One Piece is just the atmosphere: the adventure of pirates sailing over the sea with a bunch of companions from different backgrounds. It's so dreamlike. It's anyone's dream. For the first few episodes (probably around 300 episodes or so), the anime successfully depicted and highlighted this kind of atmosphere: Luffy would travel from island to island, fighting against enemies, and recruiting a new colleague along the way. Eventually, the team grows in number and they adventure together. Each member has a unique ability and character which also make it more interesting. All in all, from the atmosphere perspective, it's heaven. But I think things just get worse and worse as the show continues. The scenes were predictable and repetitive. The fights become so dull and boring. Many awkward moments. Basically, you can summarize One Piece with this: entering a new island; finding out that the island was occupied by some villains; fighting against the villains; almost getting lost, but eventually winning; the island is successfully retaken. That's it. You'll just get this kind of pattern on every arc. And I would tell you something: the core members of the team would never, ever die no matter how strong the enemy is. The fights were extremely boring. Don't expect any logical and hype moments like in AOT and Naruto. You'll just get to watch both sides punching and throwing random powers and let the author decides who wins. Of course, eventually, the Luffy team would win. They may suffer in the beginning but eventually, some magic happens to rationalize their winning. Really, you can't analyze their power. Is the amount of power makes the opponent knocked down? No. Is it the quantity of the attack? No. The author decides which attack event determines the defeat of the opponent. How about the marine squads? Well they're just punching bags. From episode 500s and so, amateur and cringe stories are spread all over the place. The most cringe one: Kozuki Oden's arc. This is probably the worst arc ever. Spoiler alert! A man who basically was capable of defeating the occupier of his island, but perhaps he was a moron and an extremely idiot guy that never learn from experience. He got defeated and humiliated times and times again simply because he accepted the peace offering from the villain. Eventually, he got arrested. He then self-incinerating himself in the promise that if he's capable of staying alive after a certain period, he'll be released. The villain, of course, broke the promise and shot him down and he died. People called it a hero. I would definitely had call him a crackbrain.",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 19, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fac840bc37,5,2770
"I can't stop talking about this show – I love it so much! I know this is a rough start to a review, but I don't care. I can't even begin to scratch the surface of why this anime and manga is just the best EVER. Especially now that 'The One Piece' is soon entering the anime world, I think the only valid criticism it might face (pacing) will disappear entirely. Though, I fear I will always love this version so much more. There's something magical about some of the filler episodes, where the characters interact without any real stakes, like G-8 early on. This series has it all: complex characters and dynamics, social commentary, soul-crushing moments, and moments that will make you laugh until your stomach hurts. There's immense world-building and lore that unfolds immersively. The characters are so compelling that most of them could have their own show, and I would tune in every time. The show lets you get to know the characters well in the pre-time skip, before its soul-crushing introduction to the time skip where things take a more serious turn. In the pre-time skip, the characters are the most compelling element. In post time-skip , the mysteries of the world, intriguing character lore , and the world-building and action take center stage. It becomes entrancing to the point where I would watch 100 episodes in less than a week and regularly lose sleep because I had to know what happens next. By the time I caught up, I cried for hours because I would never experience going into this show for the first time again. Anyway, watch 'One Piece'; you won’t regret it.

I can't put into words how much my love for one piece is, it was a journey for me, a long one but one I don't regret at all. Coming home and watching it, seeing the characters go through arcs and difficulties was just amazing and I felt so invested in it. Some of my favourite things about this anime are of course the cast of characters, main ones and side, each being so perfect that there's not a single arc's characters I disliked, the world is so detailed and planned out perfectly, the antagonists which are all so good in their own unique ways, the story arcs and how each are actually significant and don't get thrown away as the plot progresses, the entertainment and comedy, the fights and emotions, I could go on for hours. I can understand why people get turned off from the length, I do agree that the pacing is bad but mindlessly hating or watching it not to enjoy but to force yourself will never make you like One Piece. I'd say start it if you genuinely want to, if you actually watch One Piece with no bias, no matter what age you are you'll love it.

It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down.

Without even realizing it i was drawn into the anime(by the time you get to episodes 20-30 it gets intresting).The story got way better as i progressed through the anime and i enjoyed every single episode i watched. The characters also got way better. The main caracter (whom i thought was a retard at first) became my favorite anime character. He's cool (although he doesnt look it) and funny and will make you laugh so hard till you cry( this also applies to the other characters). Some fighting scenes(main ones)in the anime are INSANE, the music is beautiful,and the sad scenes in the anime will bring you soo close to tears( many people actually cried. i wsnt one of them....BELIEVE ME, I WASNT!!. but i got close to crying).

"To start off, I had seen quite a few episodes of one piece as a child on toonami, prior to even discovering what anime was in fact. From the very beginning I had adored this show, even watching the horrendous dubs on american television. To speak of the dubs, do not judge one piece by these. PLEASE. For God's sake don't hate one piece or anything about it because of what 4kids decided to do to it. Simply put they took something of masterpiece and full of depth into a shallow, horrid voice acting, and choppy version of the original. Funimation has done quite a decent job of recreating the dubbed version, but nothing can compete with the original, as the original is what it was meant to be like. Also, do not dismiss this lovely anime because of the earlier animation style of the first few episodes (as well as the more cartoony based style.) To dismiss something because of the artwork is no good reason to not watch it. THe characters are so unique and so original, and each character has meaning. Oda (the author) goes into complete detail with each of his characters. Even creating the characters in all of the filler episodes. What I can say about the story is that I have never laughed harder, sobbed more intensely, or fangirled more viciously than in this anime. The pure plot of this anime is so in depth and so intricate that I have re watched it several times (yes, all 554 episodes) So many people I come in contact with ask me ""How in the WORLD do you watch something so long? I just can't start now it's too overwhelming."" Well, let me tell you. I got so into this I was watching about 20-30 episodes daily. Just from the fact that I couldn't get enough of this anime. I really couldn't. It's starts off as a regular kind of pirate scenario where everyone wants to become the best. What really caught me is the fact that it takes every type of pirate ""legend"" or mystery and puts it into a reality. Sea monsters, crazy powers, evil marines, everything. What also caught me is starting out with one boy and one dream, and making that dream seem more and more real by the battles and crew-mates he finds along his adventure. I guess I like the flavor of starting off small and crawling your way to strength and ambition, but this anime just packs that flavor into one huge ice cream sundae. With a friggen cherry on the very top. I really have only praise for this masterpiece. Unforgettable characters, amazing scenery, endless adventure. Simply put.

"One Piece: Is it the most overrated anime of all? If this simple sentence was enough to insult me and provoke a 'confusing' reaction, you probably belong to the group I'm about to mention. The reason I say this is that, despite the incredible nature of this work, its community tends to overly praise it without any objectivity, portraying it as a perfect masterpiece. If you dare to say anything degrading about it, you are simply criticized and insulted. Personally, this significantly impacted my critical opinion when I decided to delve seriously into this work. It had been hyped up so much as a flawless creation that when I discovered it for myself, I was disappointed because it didn't live up to the expectations set for me. This doesn't mean I didn't enjoy what I saw and discovered; it simply means that the community negatively influenced my view of the series. With the final saga just beginning in the anime, I felt compelled to share my comprehensive opinion on this incredible series, One Piece! One of One Piece's biggest strengths, in my opinion, is the vastness of its universe. The various landscapes, characters, and connections between different places create a fantastic sense of constant discovery, making us feel the immensity of the world we're immersed in. This is a testament to the author's skill; you can feel Eiichirō Oda's dedication to his work and how well he knows and masters the universe he created. He can create links between episodes that only come to fruition 500 episodes later, leaving us in awe and saying, 'Wow, so that's what it was!' Another incredible aspect is One Piece's ability to appeal to a wide audience. While it may seem childish on the surface due to its humor, vibrant colors, and rounded character designs, it also has depth and addresses complex subjects like slavery (Celestial Dragon), racism (Fish-Men), poverty, and many other profound themes. It took me a while to realize how remarkable it is for One Piece to tackle such deep topics! Now, let me discuss what personally displeased me in One Piece. Although it's also a strength I mentioned, the childish aspect was sometimes too prominent for my taste. It took me a long time to adapt to One Piece's style, and in the Alabasta saga, I was frustrated by Bon Clay's character. It annoyed me to see such an eccentric character in the midst of a serious battle that could cost him his life and the lives of many others. It detracted from the seriousness of the arc and the importance of the events. I'm not against One Piece's humor, but I was often frustrated when it took up a significant space during serious and crucial arc events. I don't like to judge the plot until it's finished, especially as I write this message when the final saga is just beginning, promising to be rich in revelations. I'm somewhat skeptical about the Devil Fruit-based power system. I appreciate the credibility given to powers in anime like Naruto or Hunter x Hunter, currently, we're simply told that it's a fruit granting a specific power with a curse. I find it somewhat simplistic, but perhaps the final saga will provide more information! This point primarily addresses the anime, but the pacing is painfully slow. In simple terms, to ensure the anime never catches up to the manga, One Piece follows a pace of approximately 1 Chapter = 1 Episode. It's very slow; a seasonal anime like Chainsaw Man operates at around 3.5 Chapters = 1 Episode. The value varies depending on the arcs, but during Wano Kuni, it reached 0.6 Chapters = 1 Episode. I don't know if you realize how slow the progression is! It's sad, but if One Piece had been a seasonal anime, it would have concluded in barely 400 episodes instead of the soon-to-be 1100! One Piece's musicality is quite good with its OST, immersing us well in the universe. However, I was somewhat disappointed with the Opening/Ending songs. Apart from the cult classic ""We Are,"" none have truly left a lasting impression—they're justified in not being extraordinary. The animation has continuously evolved; the early episodes were truly awful, but the animation improved with the anime's popularity, culminating in the Wano Kuni arc, which was exceptional in style and animation quality! In conclusion, despite the long and challenging journey, much like the Mugiwara's adventure, I would recommend this work to anyone. It's an incredible universe waiting to be discovered. NO, One Piece is not a perfect anime or manga, just like any other work. However, it remains exceptional, and I invite everyone to embark on the Vogue Merry to start this long journey and discover all that One Piece has to offer!""",8,Recommended,"Jan 11, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_99e6610141,6,4651
"More than 25 years ago a little rubber-boy popped out of a barrel on a fat ladies pirate ship, and little did the world know at the time but that rubber boy would be the main character of one of the greatest stories ever told. What might seem like a silly show about pirates is deep down a story about political corruption with themes of slavery, war, and more. With the end of One Piece's fast approach, I recommend you start watching sooner than later because once what the one piece is is revealed, it will be almost impossible to watch the show without that massive spoiler. If you are still hesitant not to give one piece a shot then I, The Real Big Fat Guy, will tell you why one piece is one of the greatest stories to ever be told. Side Note: there is a lot I really want to talk about with this review due to one piece being such a grand series. Its almost impossible to talk about all those things without spoilers. So if there is going to be a major spolier, then I will put (spoiler) before it and (end) at the end of it so you can skip that section. Lets start with the negatives We all know the main one: The pacing is absolutely horrible. All of the earlier Shonen were released on a weekly basis unlike the seasonal route most shows go today. other shows of the time like Naruto deals with this fast production of episodes by creating non-canon, 10-30 episode filler arcs. Although most of these filler arcs are horrible they can be easily skipped over and it wont take away from the experience of the show. One Piece was like I am not doing all that and what it does instead is hundreds of times worse. along with the occasional 4 episode filler arc, One Piece also fluffs up the canon episodes to drag it out. This basically drags the episode out to include the filler within it. What the anime does is stretch out panels in the manga that should take up one or two seconds of the anime (like running or crowds of people) to 6-12 seconds in the episode. This is very apparent in the ""running episodes"". There are episodes in the arcs before the big fight that involves the characters running to get to a location or problem. There are full episodes that consist of just running that really sucks. its not one or two episodes either. at its peak annoyance, arcs like dressrosa, Punk Hazard, and Fishman Island have a solid 60 ""running episodes"". The worst part is it isn't even skippable unlike filler arcs because in between those 15 minutes of running, there are 5 minutes of significant plot stuff. If you cant handle the pacing and don't watch one piece because of that, I totally understand it. I'd recommend the manga or to just wait for the Netflix/WIT animations version which is going to be seasonal which is what the anime should have been in the first place. Another bad part of the show is how Oda handles killing off characters, or should I say how he doesn't kill of characters. Unless you physically see a character get a massive hole in them then don't ever think a character is dead. (the rest of this section is a spoiler) There are so many people who just die and come back like nothing happened: Pell, Bon clay, Bon Clay again, Pekoms, Jack, Sabo, Bellamy, Sky island dad, Gecko Moria, Brownbeard, and most recently Saul. With someone like Sabo or Bon clay (the first time) is understandable because they play an important role later in the series, but with someone like the sky island dad who tragically and heart-wrenchingly sacrificed himself to Enel's lightning to save his daughter. Then he just walks back Scot-free for absolutely no reason. Just a second ago this mf was looking like Ash Ketchum after Charizard blows fire in his face in disobedience and now he's fine. Its not even like he plays an important role in the story so why ruin his tragic sacrifice The most famous example is Pell. There is a whole dramatic chapter were Pell says his final goodbyes to Vivi before flying that bomb (which by the way, HAS THE POWER TO BLOW UP THE ENTIRE CAPITAL CITY) into the air to sacrifice himself for the people in the city. ten chapters later and he waddles up to his tombstone and has the audacity to ask why they think he died. MF YOU TOOK A NUCLEAR BOMB TO THE FACE, EVEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD A COUPLE EPISODES AGO. not only is that ""dramatic chapter"" were he says his goodbyes so cringey now, but it takes away from the from the emotion of the show. What good did keeping Pell alive do? He hasn't come back to help the straw hats like Sabo and Bon clay (the first time) did, and he came back right at the end of Alabasta so he didn't do anything else that arc. All this did was loose the emotion and also One Piece's credibility. Because of all these Fake out deaths, I wouldn't be surprised if Ace came back riding on whitebeards shoulders because there happened to be a guy with the Undonut fruit at Marineford or something. (end of spoilers) The comedy doesn't land most of the time. Some jokes do it but that is very occasional. Then again, most other Shonen's comedy doesn't land most of the time either so if I'm deducting points on one piece for its mediocre comedy all other Shonen's with mediocre comedy is getting deducted too. However, there is this one moment I cannot overlook because a bad gag had plot relevance. (very minor spoilers for fishman) Sanji's Perviness has always been Unfunny nuisance at best, but in the Fishman island arc Sanji is so turned on by the big-titty Mermaids that he does the anime thing were he shoots blood out of his nose and ALMOST DIES OF BLOOD LOSS. (end) In what world is that funny? To be fair, Fishman island would still be a bad arc without this moment but it genuinely ruined his character until the whole cake arc saved his likability. And that's all I could think of. I didn't mention the minor inconsistencies with devil fruits (like how it was mentioned at Alabasta that there were only 5 devil fruits that could make you fly despite 900 chapters later there are well over 20 that have some flight power with it). one piece has been going on for 2 and a half decades of course some things are going to be forgotten. plus it doesn't take away from the overarching story. I also didn't talk about the Fishman island arc but just to touch on it, everything One Piece does well before Fishman island is thrown out the window, and all of the things One Piece does not so well is intensified. Now with the good: The World Building is the best in animanga. i won't touch on this too much because its very obvious but Oda has created the most developed world in all of anime and maybe even fiction itself. Not with just the geography of the world, but with everything as a whole. Every place the Straw hats travel to has a fully fleshed out culture, community, people, landscape, etc. Every location connects to an overarching plot. There are little plot points that are teased at the start of the series that come hundreds of chapters later. No other series come close to One Piece in terms of Emersion. No character feels left behind. There are characters that you think will only be a character in an arc or two that came back 10 arcs later and turn out to be an important character in a storyline. (spoilers) when you first met jewelry bonnie and Kuma, they were two separate characters that played two side character roles in two separate arcs. But turns out they are family, and not half cousins twice removed or something stupid, they are (adopted) father and daughter. Same thing with Laboon and Brook, same thing with Dragon and Sabo, same thing with dragon and luffy, same thing with Jinbe, Arlong, and Tiger, Same thing with so many other characters. (end) there are also characters that just come back for no reason but they somehow make a good addition. (spoilers) Bege just randomly comes back in wholecake and becomes an MVP in that arc. I dont know why but it just makes sense. (end) There is very few forgotten characters and think lots of those ""forgotten characters"" are going to come back in some way. The emotion in One Piece is very top notch. I don't like the Fake out deaths but the one good thing I will say about it is it makes it so when a character does die it tear jerking. We all know which example I'm thinking of. One Piece does this thing where they give some random ass side character some tragic backstory. For example, There is a character named Senor pink who is just another wacky member of Doflamingos crew. This guy is a fully grown chubby man that wears baby clothes and a diaper but he happens to have one of the most tragic backstories in al of the anime. So many moments just give you the chills. I watched Fujitoras speech at the end of Dressrosa I got goosebumps. Even if you decide not to watch One Piece by the end of this review I beg you to please just watch the One Piece fan letter episode. Its just amazing. It does what no other anime i have seen has done before and shows the One Piece world through the perspective of a background character. As of Wano, The animation has become top notch. Especially with impact frames. just when I thought the animation couldn't get any better Egghead rolled around and blew up all my expectations. Its very scary how One pieces current animation is that good when its just a weekly series. Its better than some seasonal anime's animation which is really saying something. One Piece has two great power systems. Devil Fruits are Unique. They aren't as good as Stands or Nen but it works well for a series like one piece. There are so many unique devil fruits and the added drawback of not being able to swim is something actually worth thinking about before you eat them because the entire world is mostly water. There was a problem with devil fruits though. out of the 3 types of devil fruits, Logia were by far the most overpowered. To remedy this Oda added Haki. most of the time, adding another power system to a Shonen makes the original power system obsolete. For example, the addition of Stands in Jojos completely removed Hamon from the story. One Piece blends both power systems together really well. To succeed in the New World you either need members on your crew with Strong Haki or members on your team with an overpowered Devil fruit. Marineford is the best arc of all time. I'm not even going to explain, Feel free to disagree but you're wrong. Ngl I'm kind of getting tired of writing so ima just end it here. I could go on about the Character Development, The foreshadowing, Luffy as a Main character, the power of friendship, how it portrays real world corruption of power, Its diverse cast, I could go on and on but i'm lazy and I've done enough Dick-Riding today.

Its one of the most complex and captivating stories ever told. I wish I could go back and watch One Piece for the first time because what a time that was. If you haven't watched One Piece I encourage you to please give it a shot. Watch up to the Arlong park arc, and if you decide to keep going after that maybe, just maybe, you will see why One Piece has changed the lives of millions of people across the globe.

"One Piece is a great example of that saying ""Too much of everything is bad"". Story: 6/10 Had I only watched half of the series, then I would've given it a 10/10 score. Because One Piece is actually good, really good! - at least up until Marineford Arc - after that, the story became overly dramatic. It's as if the author himself wasn't able to move on from the reactions that Marineford arc has received - thus he started using it a lot of times to give Luffy and Ace' fans some emotional scenes - it was effective at first, but he did it too much to the point that it has lost it's effect. Overly huge size boobs - Most female characters suddenly have those overly huge boobs (especially Nami and Robin) it was used too much for fan service so the attention for the characters were often divided between their bouncing boobs and what they were doing. Another thing that I didn't like is the way that SH crew members were separated. What I really love in One Piece, is the relationship between SH crew members - that strong friendship that they built during their journey - that family like bond that they have. They cry and laugh together, face different problems together and solve them all together - I really miss that part of this series. Art: 6/10 One Piece had that unique animation and art style but after that time skip, it changed drastically. The characters are no longer as good looking as before. Sound: 5/10 The opening and ending songs weren't really my type so I often skipped them after listening to it once. Although the sound effects and musical scores that they use during emotional and intense fights scenes are really good. Character: 9/10 The main characters are still the same. They grew up and changed a lot, compared to how they were when they were introduced the first time - although they are still as hilarious as ever. There are some new characters that were introduced...they were interesting at first but they didn't left a strong impression on me...they are not the type that I will miss once they are gone.

The Marine Ford arc make so crying at the Ace's past, at Luffy, when Ace die, he has lost 2 of precious brothers! So overall the story is outstanding! The problem of the art is Hencok! Animators are mock the art of Oda's Hencock doing her very ugly! Overall it's great, it could be outstanding, but Hencok... The sounds are very good! The good of the sounds are Gomu-Gomu attacks! The sound where his arms are stretching in the sky is outstanding! The openings and endings are great! So, overall 8.5 Characters are amazing! Hencock, Jango, Moria, Luffy, Usopp, Buggy, Garp and others are so amazing!!!! They're really great! Outstanding! I love so much One Piece because he is so enjoyble! That's great adventure from East Blue to the end of the Grand Line, searching One Piece is outstanding! Oda made the main theme of the anime so cool! Luffy traveling many diffrent islands!

"One piece is a classic anime, brilliantly done with an amazing creative flare for imagination by the author. It is set in a fictional world that is divided into 4 major oceans (East, West, North, South) which meet in the centre in a place called the ""grand line"". This is supposedly a legendary place where very powerful pirates live and constantly search for the great treasure of the deceased pirate king, ""one piece"". The story follows the life of a teenager, ""Monkey D. Luffy"", who has the ability to stretch his body in any way and holds the properties of rubber. He is an extrovert character who is both stupid in personality, eats way too much food and is completely unreasonable when he wants something. His personality is almost equal to that of Goku from Dragonball, Naruto and Natsu from fairy tail. This criticism exists that one piece is another shounen anime with the same stereotypical protagonists. This is true, however, it is still the great original shounen anime and if you enjoyed any of the above you will love this one too. The anime is quite old and currently has over 650 episodes, this makes starting the anime for some people non viable due to the old graphics not being in tip top condition. YOU GET USED TO IT; and the graphics improve over time. There are tonnes of mysteries in this anime that are still being debated (which i will not spoil). Character wise there is great versatility and for some of you anime lovers there are parts where the ecchiness and comedy gets off the charts, but because Luffy is a character who doesn't understand the concept of ""mature relations"" (*cough...sex) they do not develop. If you want to watch a great anime with incredibly interesting fights and imaginative powers (called devil fruit powers in their world. E.g. control of the elements, alter your body, create earthquakes, control shadows etc...) then one piece is right for you.",9,Recommended,"Nov 11, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_893a0c9b92,6,1903

Each of the arcs are a battle against another pirate gang. Art (8/10): The art is what one first notices about One Piece. It is unusual and makes the series unique. However, people judge the anime for its art, and this doesn't do it justice. Just watch the anime, and you will notice the art works well with the anime. Sound (6/10): The music is interesting, and doesn't exactly match the anime, but is still a pretty good choice. Character (9/10): The characters are what make this anime.

"One Piece is of the least enjoyable anime shows I have ever watched, or least it ended up being that. (No story spoilers, only allusions to some events) OP itself is a quite funny, sometimes pretty emotional, relatively exciting shounen show with a unique and sizable universe, even though the writing lacks oftentimes in terms of consistency in the characters' behavior, unnecessary asspulls, emotional manipulation by the author (e.g. fakeout deaths) and characters devoid of any interesting personality traits (mostly minor antagonists). My biggest gripe with OP has always been the longer arcs with drawn out battle sequences that last far too long and bear almost zero consequences for the whole franchise. It's a really fun adventure story when the characters are allowed to find out stuff about the world, but the author more and more ends up forcing the Straw Hats into long-winded battle-shounen frenzies where they fend off some of the least memorable ""bad guys"" I had yet to witness in shounen works. I don't think One Piece is a bad story, but it has an abundance of issues with characterizations of important characters (some major antagonists regularly ruin their own ""grand plans"" just by being stupidly written, there is rarely a good reason for them to self-manipulate the way they are) and is definitely more suited for a very young audience (early teens) but still somewhat enjoyable for people of any age group thanks to its plump humor and gorgeous art style (aside from a lot of women's faces looking the same). However, aside from the anime's story, Toei Animation's pacing of the latter half of the story so far ruins the entire vibe and sometimes adapts only about one or two handful of manga pages in a full 23 minute episode... The New World arcs are so horribly paced that I could not bear it anymore in Wano, even though this was the arc I was always looking forward to. Just read the manga if you're interested. If you have however no issues with horrible pacing similar to Dragon Ball Z etc., I guess you'd enjoy this as well..",4,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a5d17c058,6,2058
"""One Piece is a never-ending dumpster fire of bloated bullshit. The pacing is a joke — it’s like they’re purposely trying to make you lose your will to live, dragging out every fight and arc for what feels like centuries. It’s like they think we can’t tell the difference between actual plot development and just filling time with random filler episodes that have no purpose other than to drag the series out longer. The same story beats keep getting recycled, and nothing ever feels like it’s actually progressing. Every time you think they’re about to wrap something up, here comes another pointless arc to waste your life away. And let’s talk about the animation for a second — it’s ridiculously over-the-top and childish. The fights are a mess of flashing lights and ridiculous moves that are more about spectacle than actual stakes. It’s like they’re more concerned with making every battle look like an explosion of colors than actually having a decent plot. Then there’s the constant, laughable power-ups. Every new transformation or move just gets more absurd, as if they’re trying to see how much nonsense they can throw at the screen before it collapses under its own weight. Nothing feels earned anymore, it’s just one big, never-ending series of cheap tricks to keep fans hooked. And don’t even get me started on the fanbase. They act like ""One Piece"" is this untouchable masterpiece that can't be criticized, but it’s a glorified pirate soap opera that’s been dragging on for way too long. Honestly, this show should’ve ended 700 episodes ago, but instead, it’s just an endless cash grab that’s wasting your time and brain cells. It's a franchise that’s become a parody of itself, and the worst part? People still defend it like it’s some grand, life-changing experience. Get over it — it’s just a cartoon, and it’s been out of ideas for years."" Also we need to talk about the idea of 'freedom' in One Piece ""One Piece has this twisted, childish idea of freedom that doesn’t even come close to reality. The author seems to think that freedom is just about doing whatever the hell you want with no consequences, like the world owes you something just because you want to live how you choose. Luffy and his crew prance around like they’re some kind of freedom fighters, but all they’re doing is running around causing chaos, stealing treasure, and trampling over everyone else’s lives for their own selfish goals. The idea that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want, with no regard for anyone else is the *opposite* of true freedom. True freedom means understanding that your choices affect others. It’s not about being a reckless, self-centered idiot and acting like you're on some grand adventure. It's about being responsible for your own actions and respecting the rights and freedoms of those around you. But nope, in *One Piece*, freedom is just an excuse to do whatever the hell you want without thinking for a second about the consequences — just because you're a pirate with a dream. It’s a fantasy world where freedom is just a free pass to do whatever makes you feel good at the moment, no matter how many people get screwed over in the process. Luffy’s ‘freedom’ is nothing more than a lazy cop-out for not having to face the reality that freedom comes with accountability. But the show doesn’t want you to think that deeply about it. It just wants you to cheer for a guy who’s too busy acting like a child to ever actually grow up and understand what real freedom even means.""

"Let me just start off with saying this: if you need 750+ episodes and your story isn't even halfway over, you're a s*** writer. NO EXCUSES ODA. I've invested sooooo much time into the series but I'll be damned if I don't some day get a time machine so take it all back and do something productive with my life. Story: 2/10 - it's so ridiculously repetitive you'll want to cry. Protagonists go to island, island has some shit going on and the straw hats have to basically destroy the entire underground criminal organization of each freaking island, whether they just be lowly criminals terrorizing the city or the entire government of the island is corrupt. I understand that the Straw hats are the ""good guys"" but do they really have to overthrow the monarchy of every freaking island they land on I mean Jesus Christ. Characters: 3/10 - Each character has some tragic backstory and seem important until they just fade into the background of the straw hat crew because of Oda's complete inability to add any sort of profound depth to his characters. They are all the same as day 1, and they cling to the same annoying cliches even after they've been burned to the ground. Hey you know how brook is a skeleton? Ya let's make him say 50 million skull jokes it's not like those got old after the second time. Hey you remember how bad Zoro was with directions for the first 100 or so episodes? No? Well now he randomly can't walk straight without getting lost. Franky became considerably more lame after the time skip, personality and design wise, and as for the rest of the straw hats they are just ""OK"". Drama/realisim: (SPOILERS) -100/10 - Alright, do you guys remember when that bird dude took a f***ing nuke to the face and walked it off like it was nothing? That was pretty cool. Or how about when Doflammingo shot the living s*** out of trafalgar law after beating the crap out of him and piercing his chest multiple times and then we see him just a few episodes later with just a few scratches and bruises? Or how about when Jimbe got his f***ing organs obliterated by akainu and then lived to tell the tale like it was nothing? What about when Robin blew up igoram's ship in a HUGE pillar of fire and he returned to alabasta and we never even got an explanation as to what happened, he was just fine! Has a bomb even killed a single person in the series yet? Probably not, and that's pretty impressive considering taking a bomb to the face is like a daily ritual to these people. No matter who you are, civilian or hero; you will inevitably get blown up and be perfectly fine at some point in the series. What the f*** Oda, are all of your characters made out of adamantium or something? Since we know that Oda's a lil b**** who never kills anyone if it doesn't progress the story, this leads to a lot of ""Fake"" drama in the series. We know that even though that dude just got his face shot in by the evil guy, he's gonna be a-okay. This becomes downright insulting after the 500th time it happens. I know it's really only natural to worry about the safety of your friends after they've just been curb stomped into oblivion, but since no one ever dies in series, it makes you not care. This is not drama, it's just an overused cliche that the writers still think they can milk and get away with and it's lazy. sound: 5/10: nothing exceptional about it but it's okay. animation: 2/10: it sucks. Conclusion: If I could go back in time and tell younger me to just stick a fork in the outlet instead of watching this show, I would do it in a heartbeat.

"Maybe it's a bit late, but this year I decided to catch up with One Piece. I have seen 296 episodes so I think (and hope) I am eligible of writing a review. My native language is not English so bear with me if I make mistakes of any kind. Also this is my first review. If someone would ask me to review this show in one sentence I would tell him the following: ""This show is a masterpiece"". I have to note that this review is solely based on my opinion and everyone has the right to have an opinion should that be bad or good. I am not saying that other people are wrong. So, let's start the review... Story The story is the greatest I have seen in a anime. It has a bit of everything: drama, comedy, action. At first it may seem that this is a comedy anime, but the more you watch it the more surprised you will be, because of the seriousness this show can deliver when it is needed. It has a perfect balance between comedy and drama. The story can be so deep that at some point you may even shed a tear. Art Despite of all the negative things people said about the art, I, personally really enjoy it. I can say that from the first episode the art was great in my opinion, but it keeps getting better and better after each episode. After I saw some flashbacks of the first episodes I was really surprised of how much the art developed since then. Sound The sound of this show is really good. The OST (original soundtrack) really adds a good feel to the story. At the very dramatic moments it makes it even more dramatic, which is a really nice thing. Character One of the best thing in this show are the characters. The makers of this anime really made a good job bringing you close to the characters. I feel like I am on their ship, sailing with them and when they got some problems I can really feel their pain and suffering. The voice actors do a really great job (I watch it in Japanese version, I don't know about the English version, because I haven't seen it) and every character is unique in its own way. Enjoyment The enjoyment of this anime is outstanding. I could never get bored of it, because it keeps getting better every episode. Eiichiro Oda, the mangaka, does a great job in writing awesome stories with nice plot twists. Overall Overall this anime is a masterpiece. As I said earlier, I didn't write any review before this, but I felt this anime really deserved one and I wanted to express my feelings about it.",10,Recommended,"Jan 4, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_694421a236,6,2430
"One Piece is one of those unique animes that stand out among thousands of others.Oda the creator, is one of the best of the best. PROS: -story and characters are well defined, as the story develops so does the characters. - each character is unique in different ways and each of them have different goals. -one piece is ""shounen"" it has a lot of action, comedy and emotional at times. never fails to disappoint. - sound is superb, creates an atmosphere which other animes fail accomplish. - ""Pirates"" one piece is one of the few animes who like to explore other cultures and isnt very traditional to the Japanese anime. CONS: - the only downside of one piece, is that the artworks are different than what most animes are use to. but it does not matter because its about pirates, not ninjas.",10,Recommended,"Jul 31, 2009",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9ca3515170,6,790
"Long-time fans of this show have always sung all its praises to me, before adding the caveat of ""...but the pacing gets worse later on in the show"". ... ""Gets""? I'm sorry, ""GETS""?! I had to watch at double speed to get through Syrup Village. For those not familiar, it's one of the earliest arcs, and it's very short as far as one piece arcs go. Cut to one guy saying how he's gonna destroy the heroes. Cut to wide shot for demonstration of power, probably by attacking an inanimate object. Cut to reaction shot. Cut to a couple other reaction shots (about 7 seconds each) because you really need a separate *frame* for each facial expression to keep the viewer caught up. Cut to secondary villain on the side smirking and muttering about how currently-in-combat villain is one of the strongest of their group. Cut to reaction shot of a protagonist with eyes shaded out, ready to take on the villain. Protagonist mutters something intimidating. Then you see TO BE CONTINUED. The 20 minutes of your life have already been deposited, you can't cancel the transaction. There are plenty of things about the other aspects of the show to talk about, and even admire, but the pacing tanks everything so much that it's hard to think about anything else when thinking about this show. The story? There are great things about it, but there are also very formulaic things about it, which isn't inherently a problem unless one predictable and uninteresting fight becomes two hours of your life. The characters? They're still cool, but if you have to wait a year for them to do anything, you begin to get annoyed at them for not just wrapping things up. The humor? It's great in manga form, because your mind automatically adjusts the comedic timing of scenes in a still panel to however it likes, but when the anime draws out every reaction and punchline and adds the same corny wacky boingy sound effect to every single one, it's horribly unfunny. I could absolutely be wrong, but I have to assume that the majority, maybe even the vast majority, of people who earnestly recommend this show, started it as kids. I'd understand. I'm sure that I, as a kid, would not have cared. How one can watch this for the first time in their adult life and enjoy it is beyond me. Do try the manga.

"I don't know any other anime where the community comes up with so many interesting theories and where there are such diverse characters. For me, One Piece is more than just an anime – it is a part of my childhood that I have enjoyed for many years. Each arc brings new adventures that captivate you time and again. The themes of friendship and pursuing dreams are at the heart of the story, making the anime particularly touching. You can see how the characters grow together, support each other, and fight for their goals. This message is inspiring and motivating, especially for younger viewers. One Piece is not only exciting but also incredibly funny. The humorous moments and unique characters often make you laugh.

"Character development was non-existent and the couple of times it did happen, it was a downgrade rather than an upgrade. This is a well known fact but I’ll chime in a little and talk about three characters in particular: Sanji, Nico Robin and Luffy. Let’s start with Sanji. Now, a lot of viewers like myself find his perverted behavior to be too cheesy, cringe and annoying. It used to be funny but now it’s just too dull and repetitive. We’ve been awaiting his character development for ages and when Pudding broke Sanji’s heart, that was literally the perfect moment for him to grow out of his childish infatuation with every stranger woman he comes across. It was a good chance for him to realize that there are toxic women among strangers who can hurt him like pudding did. What does the author do instead? Makes him an even bigger pervert than before. Seriously, well done Oda. Now let’s move on to robin. I especially hate what happened to her. She used to be such a cool and interesting character and was a fan favorite in the crew for many. During the time skip, many people thought that Robin like the rest of the crew would undergo a massive change where she gets stronger and gains new Intel from the revolutionary army which could assist the crew in interesting ways while maintaining her cool and mysterious persona but instead, she returns as a (excuse my language) MILF and has been reduced to a background character. She’s basically eye candy now. As for the main character Luffy, he’s had the same personality at the age of 7 that he does now at the age of 19. Fights: The events surrounding the fights in one piece make no sense. There is almost no strategy or planning whatsoever whether the main character is breaking into the most secure military stronghold in the world (Enies lobby) or a world-class prison (Impel down). Luffy just barges right in and from there on out, plot armor carries him to victory. Do note that the opponent is supposed to be stronger than Luffy. Not just luffy, his entire crew is separated to fight one-on-one against opponents which are stronger than them and somehow, every single enemy will lose whilst every single straw hat will win. What makes it worse is that there is almost no suspense or suspicion for the future because you already know that everyone fighting on Luffy’s side is going to survive.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 23, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_57a6fb0428,7,2356
"At first you think that One Piece is a typical Shonen with ridiculous fights and shitty drawing. In fact, these two never improve. But there are things that make One Piece soooooo... much better than Bleach, Naruto and even Hunter x Hunter. And these things are the story, characters, foreshadowing and the unique One Piece universe. There are also nice concepts about will inheritance, man's dreams and giving up personal goals for the sake of close friends/relatives. Ok. So here are my scores: Art: 0/10 Music: 0/10 Fights: 0/10 World design: 0/10 Characters: 10/10 Story: 50/10 So Overall: 60/60. Deal with it. The problem with One Piece is that you need to understand all these foreshadowings, concepts and not complain about PIS's (Plot Induced Stupidities) which can be quiet difficult. So there will be a problem if you are mature enough to see all the stupid and ridiculous things but not mature enough to enjoy the good things. P.S.

"I don't know how to start writing this review because I don't know how to type what emotions I go through while watching this anime (and often days after). But the biggest feeling I get is awe. Awe with jaw drops and goosebumps. One top of that there's hilarious comedy, some tearful moments and conveyed anger. That is a part of what makes up my favourite anime of all time, One Piece. Even though I would think most know the basics of One Piece, I'll go through it again. There once lived a man named Gol D. Roger who was given the title The Pirate King. At his moment of execution, he announced that his greatest treasure, One Piece, is hidden away in 'that place' and invited anyone to find it. This brought The Great Age of the Pirates and many men set out to the sea to find One Piece and become Pirate King. The story follows Luffy, probably the most lovable hero you'll ever come across. He aims to become Pirate King and sets out on a journey through the seas to wholeheartedly follow his goal. He first plans to gather his crew members and a ship to then journey through the greatest and toughest seas, The Grand Line. Story 10/10 - The story One Piece follows is very unique, not just in comparison to other animes but also Hollywood. You might say, 'Pirates, big whoop, it's been done before' but I have no words to express how wrong you'd be. I wasn't a fan of the pirate genre (unless it had Johnny Depp in it) but One Piece opened my eyes. The plot is solid and I have to say that Oda knows how to tie everything together perfectly. There's nothing that doesn't happen for a reason in this anime. There aren't many useless fillers or completely pointless arcs. As the story moves further, you'll find yourself getting more and more attached. Sound 10/10 - The sound is brilliant. The music gets you leaning forward in your seat, eyes wide, grips hardened (hmm, sounds too much like a H-anime but you get what I mean). Without the music to braze together everything, I doubt One Piece would be worth half its value. The moods are set perfectly and I yet have to pick out a moment where a sound theme has even been a second too late or early. I get so hyped up when hearing certain music themes. Every character also has their own theme song which is just done perfectly to suit the character. Another thing that suits the characters is the laugh each character is given with their persona, each unique. Art 10/10 - I do admit I was one of those people who put off One Piece for a long time because I didn't like the art. I don't know if my vision was lacking because now that I can finally see, it is truly spectacular art. I thought the character design seemed half done but it couldn't suit each person more. The background art has always been beyond standards with certains scenes where you just want to pause and stare at. After the time skip, the art becomes more modern (by that I mean crisp). The characters have a new added gloss but they still have the style unique to One Piece. The main thing which I love about the animation is that there are regular costume changes for the characters. So you never sit through it and wonder if they actually are stinky pirates with scurvy. Characters 10/10 - Probably the strongest point of One Piece, as it should be for any anime (unfortunately this is too much to ask for in most cases). Luffy is an unwavering character who will always do what he thinks is right. He is childish and a bit spoilt but this makes him the person who everyone is drawn to. He doesn't chase any unnecessary romances, his mind is set to his one goal to become Pirate King. I have never heard (and doubt I ever will hear) anyone mention anything along the lines of 'I dislike Luffy'. The other main characters are also just as worthy. Zoro's determination makes him one of my favourite characters, also because he's just boss with his santoryu. Nami is a theif whose main interest is money and navigating but isn't that a true pirate? Her cunning ways make her the awesome character she is. Usopp is well Usopp. He's a liar and a coward just as his name states but he brings about the greatest character development because I have to say that I absolutely hated him at the start. Sanji is just kickass (it's a pun because he kicks to fight). His overly love towards women does become occasionally annoying but he is an amusing and strong character. Chopper, is a cotton candy loving reindeer often mistakened as a tanuki (racoon). He is a cute, lovable, funny character who can become something else when pushed. Robin is a smart character whose wit always has you thinking how cool she is. Franky is a suuppeerr character. He's strong and really funny. Brook is a very unique person. He's a hentai whose jokes always make you crack up laughing. All of these characters come with unique back stories and a purpose which I just love. The supporting characters of One Piece have been given so much of thought. Many characters grow to become your favourites. Characters such as Ace, Whitebeard, Mihawk, Shanks, Hancock, even though they don't play the main role, it feels as though a lot of thought has been poured into them. There have also been characters who were purposely created to hate, like the tenryuubito. All in all, the character section makes up the main traits of One Piece. Overall 10/10, I don't think I can give this any other score. It is an anime for all ages and I promise you that you will never regret watching it. One Piece isn't just something for entertainmemt, it's become a part of my life.",10,Recommended,"Nov 9, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_02e892daf5,7,5555

"OK this is my first review so here it goes, One Piece(OP) is a fantastic story about friendship, hard work, determination, and chasing your dreams. This show was one of the first animes that i ever watched and inspired me to continue watching anime. If you like idiotic humor, kick-ass action, and a touching story with very lovable characters, One Piece is the show for you. Story 10/10 This story is all about the voyage of Monkey D. Luffy as he gathers up crew members and they experience many trials that will test their friendship and ultimately deepen their bond as they sail across the Grand Line. I love how this story develops early on as the original members are acquired. Not only are they accompanying Luffy and aiding him on his journey, but they are also chasing their own dreams as well. Now, about the oh so familiar fillers, compared to the other long running animes OP isn't jammed packed with fillers. In the beginning it moves pretty fast but as it catches up to the manga the story definitely slows in pace. Although there are less fillers, they are present but i found them to be very enjoyable. There are multiple filler arcs that last for multiple episodes but they fit in perfectly with the story. The reason these arcs are so enjoyable are because of the characters. Characters 10/10 The main characters of OP are definitely my favorite part about the show. They all have great personalities that compliment each other. There are the idiot comic relief members,the voice of reason members, the bad-ass members, and the weak/support type characters of the crew. I'm not going to sit here and say that i love every character every episode; i've had my fair share of times were each has angered me in the way. But it's that exact feeling that makes you fall in love with the crew. Just like our own friends we have all had times when we hated our friends and its times like those that help friendships grow to be even stronger then before. The ups and downs of the crew as they grow to be closer nakama (a term VERY often used in the show) will have you yearning for more as you begin to hope for their dreams as much as they do. Sound 10/10 Music is also a huge part of OP and adds a lot to the overall feel of the show. First off the opening songs for the show never disappoint and i find the opening to set the mood and can get you pumped each episode in a season. Not only are the opening songs fantastic, but each character has his own theme music. Each character has his or her own BGM that play when its his/her time to shine. Art 9/10 OP's art is good and unique, that being said i still think it is a step down from other popular series (like Naruto or Bleach). By no means is it bad, i find its subtle uniqueness to be very appealing if you're looking for something a little bit different. I enjoy watching and couldn't imagine the characters portray any other way. Overall 10/10 I love this show and it is definitely one of my favorites. It is a great shounen battle and i highly recommend it to anyone willing to take the 500+ episode leap. As someone who watched 415 episodes basically nonstop and has been watching it weekly ever since. It is never too soon, and never too late, to take the journey with Luffy and his crew across the Grand Line on a rollercoaster of emotion for the ultimate treasure ONE PIECE.",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d558c0348,7,3348

One Piece is about Luffy whose ambition is to find a treasure, One Piece, and become the King of Pirates. To achieve that, he assembles several friends along his journey and has to face many strong opponents. This anime is VERY addicting and after watching a dozen of episodes you will want to watch all of them for sure. Normally, its quite a comical anime and with lots of fights.

Thrilling and exiting a story that had many anime-watchers riveted. ART: The art is Awesome the animation was fixed a little after some 200 eps(or so) every detail every part that is important for the viewer to understand the situation is being drew excelently CHARACTER: I think that the characters are one of the most outstanding things in One Piece. For starters the main character the one that wants to become king of the pirate is UNIQUE, moreover other characters are so weird and peculiar and by using them the anime is far more intersting and fun. ENJOYMENT: Not much about the enjoyment i just have to say that when an episode finishes i was like: ""i want more One Piece!!""

"If you asked me about One Piece, i would tell you that it's one, if not the greatest shounen ever, with fun characters, great adventure, fights, feels and backstories. Once you specify that you're talking about the Anime? Oh boy. The adaptation is done by Toei animation. At first it wasn't terrible. The animation has always been kinda Meh but i can take that without that many issues. However, in the Skypiea Arc i've noticed a reused soundeffect from Dragon Ball (the fuck?) and i started to get a little salty about the adaptation. After the 2 year time skip it was getting worse and worse, animation, sound, pacing, comedy. All of it was getting worse by the minute. Now, at around episode 820 the issues are worse than ever. You see, the anime is catching up to the manga, but they don't want to stop cranking out the anime, nor do they want to go the Filler route. So instead they stretch it out as much as possible. So much so that about half of the ""content"" in the current anime epsodes, isn't in the manga. For example, the fights. In the manga they are emotional and hype. In the anime, you see them talk for 3 minutes, than it's gonna focus on someone else, than it gets back, a single punch is landed (that you see in stillshot for 2 minutes), than it cuts to other characters talking for 5 minutes......you get the point. Not only that the pacing gets fucked up like this. They often try to add comedic moments to make it more bearable. Except they fail. Hard. What you have now is such a chaotic and slow development of characters plot, butchered comedy and basically everything else that's been altered by toei is shit too. Stuff that takes a chapter in the manga, takes 3 episodes in the anime. Not only that, but at the start of each episode, there's a ""recap"" of the last episode, then opening, then stuff happens (but not really), then there is ending and preview for the next episode. Just like that, 24 minute episode has 12 minutes of the actual anime, which consists out of 8 minutes of exposition, 2 minutes of stillshots and 2 minutes of actual content. One piece is great, don't take me wrong. Hell at the start of the anime, it was pretty good, but as time went on, it kept getting worse and worse and now i consider it borderline unwatchable. TL;DR If you want to experience the Magical journey that is One Piece, read the manga. the anime is a little over 820 episodes ATM so catching up will take you a while, and once you do catch up, there's no hype or emotion, just ruin and a hollow shell of the manga that's been beaten to death by toei.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 1, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b82551234f,7,2574
"( contained, and sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language + i'm still amateur on writting reviews) One Piece is one of the most popular anime/manga series. But i have to say that the manga is way better than the anime for sure. Not because of the few filler episodes, but for the slow pacing, which became more obvious in the recent years and the mediocre animation. But let's go further. Story: 9 The story is about Luffy who wants to become the king of pirates. He and his nakama, sail across the Grand Line to fulfil their dreams/goals. The story is simple, BUT you will see thousands of characters, different events, battles, sad-epic-happy moments. And that is what makes One Piece story more unique than other shounen series. There are some filler episodes, but it is a small amount of them. Art: 7 Despite the very mediocre animation, the art is good and it fits One Piece. There is no CGI, and the animation does get better throughout the series, but still, for the year of 2015, the animation is like being in 2003. Also, compared to the manga, the animation is childish. Anyway, the art is unique again, but here the unique is not that good. Sound: 8 The voice actors fit perfectly every One Piece character. The backround music also fits the atmosphere, and the content of the soundtrack is big. It rarely uses some soundtracks, and some of them can be listened in almost every episode. It's not the best content of soundtracks you'll hear, but they are the best for One Piece. Character: 10 This is what makes One Piece one of the best series of all time. Unique characters with their own backstories, awesome villains, both the main and secondary characters are amazing, and the secondary characters support the series in a great way. The motivations of the villains and their backstories will give you the thrills. Plus, the character develpoment of the main characters throughout the series is amazing. New fighting techinques, new relationships etc.. Enjoyment: 9 There are definetely many episodes ( currently there are almost 720 episodes) and sometimes there is some low pacing( especially in the past 2-3 years) and many of the arcs are huge (like 40+ episodes) but the story NEVER gets boring. Overall: 8 If you are a shounen fan, then One Piece is for you. Maybe not the best shounen anime out there, especially if you don't like an anime with so many episodes and somekind of childish content ( almost no blood in scenes where in the manga there is blood) but still, a popular anime with many fans. It is my favourite anime, but definetely not the best i've watched.

"To be clear, I've been following the OP manga since it began serialization, and I follow it religiously. One Piece is the most epic saga ever written. That being said, I pretty much despise the animated version, other than a handful of movies such as Chopper's Drun Island movie To sum it up, - bad animation...not only bad, so little content, yet they keep repeating frames - bad timing and awkward presentation of punchlines - excessive fanservice to the point of stupidity - overall bad directing. They always try too hard to look cool, yet they just can't pull it off. All of these points are probably quite subjective. Over the years I have tried to watch a few episodes here and there, but I couldn't stand it. Then I figured maybe the movies (Strong World) and OVA (3D2Y special) would be better...but no. Same issues that plague the TV, just with better quality animation. That and I can't fathom watching 700 episodes of a single series.

Watch it if you want great story with comedy,action,sadness all the different kind of emotions then definitely watch it . But if you're not hooked by episode 60 then drop it , its not for you. One Piece just gets better and better with every arc. Even if it didnt hook you up after 40 episodes it will definitely hook you up at 200+ episodes point.",10,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_687c64bf3f,7,538

"Since the last review I wrote was a little overwhelmed by my fan-boying crap, well it was the first one I ever wrote tho, and I decided to be a little more objective about writing a review about One Piece. I, myself, really adore this one, but people mostly underrate it because it has many episodes, or is a little bit old. Anyways, let's begin. Story - 8/10 - The story is focused about Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who lived in the era known as ""The Great Age of Pirates"", which was encouraged by the great Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. Altho the anime is really old(began airing in 1999), the story is very well writen, by my opinion. It currently has 683 episodes and is still ongoing and like every anime that has a lot of episodes, it does have quite much fillers indeed, and they can be really annoying I admit that. It also has somekind of a unique story, and that pirate theme is really awesome in some ways. You don't see much animes that have the pirate-theme in them. As I was saying, the story is really unique. Now, that were mostly pros of One Piece, but it has a few cons aswell. Like, the plots aren't such good ones, they're mostly predictable. This wasn't a spoiler, it was just a fact. Altho i watched every single arc from the beggining till the end, some of them aren't really needed there, they're fillers put in that way. Art - 6/10 - I rate the animation of this anime on a 6. I've taken into account that this anime dates from 1999, but even now the animation isn't such high-quality. Even if it is available in 1080p HD, it isn't very admirable, so I rated it a 6. Sound - 7/10 - Aswell as the animation, the sound in some point in the anime is really bad, and at some points it's really good. If we take OST's and openings into the account for sound, I say that they add quite a bit to the total experience of One Piece. Characters - 8/10 - I think that the characters were really made up well, and that he added just what it was needed to make them compatible with eachother by making them all share the same horrific past. Some people may think it's a little bit of exaggerating, and I think so too, it isn't very realistic for them all to have traumas from their childhood, or to bear scars, but that's what he did so the characters could've bonded through the anime by experiencing ""hell and heaven"" with eachother. I approve of this in my own way. Enjoyment - 8/10 - I give it a total enjoyment of 8. It is a little bit different from a regular Shounen anime, but what made me give it a 9 is just because I enjoyed watching every second of it so, so, so much, even if it were fillers. It had a lot of emotional scenes aswell that I still like rewatching from time to time. If I was more objective about this, and if I considered other people opinions about this, I would've said it's a 6 or a 5. But I simply don't think that way, and I may have fan-boyed it a bit on the end, but hey, I really liked this anime tho. Overall - 7/10 - I'd give it a total of a 7. It's a very objective view about it, if it was myself I'd give it a 10, but honestly, it doesn't deserve it. If you look through the grades I've been giving all over, it has to be a 7 overall. If you're gonna watch this anime you should be prepared for the bad animations for about 300 first episodes, then it sharpens up a bit i think, and gets at about 720p, but it all comes down the the personal opinions of people, if you like this type of anime I don't think you'll mind the animation much. Also, I forgot to mention, it has quite a few movies(12 or 13, can't remember straight now) and a couple of specials. I think I've written a better review than my last one, and thanks if you read it to the end.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5bd60751f3,7,3696
"Pacing is extremely horrible. Story is extremely amazing. Art is extremely horrible. 1/10 for the the ugliest and most painful pacing in this whole world. Even Dragonball Super had a less painful pacing. The worst thing about this anime is that is gets you hooked on the amazing story and tortures you with the pacing. Since the story is amazing, I guess the manga will be a masterpiece, but in no way does this show deserve anything more than a 1 out of 10. Actually, everyone should completely stop watching this thing so that they stop doing this nonsense, which is to make the pacing extremely slow just so that they won't have to pause the show a little and have the manga get ahead a little and then resume. Heck, I am pretty sure fillers are waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more enjoyable than having to watch 20 minutes of an episode with 5 minutes worth of content.",1,Not Recommended,"Sep 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b7b3d73a3,7,877
"Ok, since there are so many reviews for One Piece, so I'll try not to rehash the usual stuff. This review will more like why you should watch one piece. Story: If there is one word to describe One Piece's story, I'd pick ""GRAND"". 500+ episodes and it's only 1/2 to 2/3 of the way there. The story is about Luffy who wants to be the Pirate King, so he set sail to Raftel which holds the treasure called One Piece. In his journey there, he picked up nakama (comrades) and meet new people along the way. Some of the islands that they stopped by are: Desert kingdom Winter island Prehistoric island Venice style waterworld Sky islands Haunted island Amazon style women only island Fishman island deep under the sea The formula is somewhat standard, where you will discover the past of the island, and Luffy will fight the strongest enemy to help the islands. However, each island's story and characters are unique so it's a new adventure every time they set foot on an island. Mysteries: Besides the main plot, there are also some side mysteries that keep viewers guessing and spawned hundreds of forum posts. Luffy's father, ancient weapons, void century, what is One Piece etc. These are unraveled slowly and tastefully along the way. Characters: This is where One Piece shine the most. The characters are some of the most unique and wacky of all the anime/manga I've watched. You will laugh, cry, and feel for them. The main characters will grow, but their personality is consistent throughout the anime. Some characters who ate the Devil Fruit are given unique abilities. Like Luffy's rubber ability which allow him to stretch his body, or Ace's flame ability to allow him to turn into flame. Final words: If you have not watched One Piece, you might be overwhelmed by the sheer number of episodes. However, it's a blessing that you can watch One Piece non-stop while those who have caught up are waiting agonizingly for 1 episodes per week. Give One Piece a try and you might discover why One Piece is the most popular manga series in Japan.",10,Recommended,"Dec 15, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0c87391584,7,2042
"I know this may sound cliche. But One Piece is the best anime for me. Despite its many flaws, such as graphical inconsistencies, to the very bad pacing. But despite all that, it's really cool that Toei Animation has been able to keep this anime going for over 20 years. I judge an anime by how much I enjoy watching it. And honestly, there are quite a few parts of One Piece that make me feel sleepy, or boring. And that should lower my rating. But because I judge the whole thing, I really enjoyed Luffy's journey to become the pirate king, despite the many flaws and criticisms that can be given, I still think this is the best anime. There is news that this anime will get a remake called ""The One Piece"" and I really hope that it will fix all the mistakes in One Piece. I will lower my rating if the remake succeeds, and becomes better than the original version. I know my review will sound very very biases, and I think you can say that.

"Episode 898 proved it again, this Anime is not worth the time. What happened? It began so strongly, with an anmiation and art-style which needed some time to get used to it but once you did, it suddenly fit. Moreso the story was so rich after a while, you didn't even think about it. But let us get to the present time. The most recent Episode showed perfectly what is wrong with One Piece. It drags too much. It takes up to 5 minutes and sometimes longer with one character building up his technique. To fill more time, the main characters fight side characters who have no purpose in the story than just to get beaten up. But it takes up so much time as if something interesting is happening. You learn nothing new, there is no story progress, but those battles takes 10 minutes and more of the airtime. It is always used for comedic purposes and to show how strong the mc is. We know. We saw it 6000 times already. It doesn't matter if you put cool music under it, even the music starts to become unbearable. The mangaka Oda knows, he draws one or two panels with those and moves on. The worst part are the One Piece apologists. And i don't mean those who truly enjoy the show and defend it, bless them. I mean those who see the problems, are aware of it, they don't like it either but since they protected and defended this show since the beginning against Naruto and Bleach, yes that far back the Big 3 times, it became their second nature. If i didn't invest so much time in this show i would've dropped it. The characters are likeable though some characters now became so one-dimensional, they became boring. I don't see this as much of a problem because i trust Oda to create an arc where they will get a progress. As already stated, the characters, even side characters are the strong point of this show. The story is interesting and is building up since years, though you still can't see where it is going. Enel going to the moon, when everybody thought he is just mad, seems to have a bigger plot role than thought. This is how One Piece catches you. You can engage in many theories and conspiracies. Who doesn't love to do that? I've long decided to read the manga and the only reason i watch the show is because of my little cousin who likes to come over and watch it with me, since i pamper him. He still enjoys it, but he is 8.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 18, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e77e6da7b1,7,2342
"One Piece is The Greatest Shonen Anime/Manga of all time. It features a grand adventure full of colourful and developed characters, each with their own unique goals and dreams. The narrative is extremely well-paced and intriguing with great writing and presentation; the Animation and Music are both incredibly top-notch. They give each Arc/Location it's own style of atmosphere which makes the series very innovative. This coincides with the genius storytelling that balances badass action scenes and hilarious comedic moments. One Piece is also a very memorable show with gorgeous imagery and designs. An example of this brilliance is in the backstory for the Punk Hazard Arc where a character with a Fire-type ability battles an Ice-type character for a long time in one location, an island. This results in a contrast of settings and characters because half the island is covered in Ice while the other half is engulfed by Fire, so different variations and ideas are explored in just one Arc! Finally, the series just knows how to have fun and not be overly-dramatic like many other Animes. This in turn, makes the few brilliant dramatic episodes all the more impactful!

"ok where to start hmmm.... the first anime i saw was naruto and after watching all the eps i thought that naruto was the best anime. But by the time i was watching 1 ep a week i started watching bleach. The same thing happened again because i was watching 1 ep a week of bleach and naruto. So, i then started watching one piece (thank god there was enough episodes to keep me going for a while) and to this day i realised that out of those 3 anime one piece was the best and my favourite. What makes One Piece so great? The storyline is good and keeps you guessing to what ""One Piece"" is but then you realise it doesn't matter because the journey is what matters the most. It has a great balance of happy and sad. There are alot of times where i have shed tears but also times of tears of joy - this rarely happens in other anime. The characters aren't overpowered. This is essential because it adds a sense of realism. Roronoa Zoro is my fave character but he has no devil fruit which makes it more awesome. EPIC. It is the most EPIC anime i have seen so far. Oda (mangaka for one piece) doesn't overuse death to create emotional scenes. I think this is much harder but it makes it feel more authentic and not cheap. Nakama/Friendship. This is probably the best quality of One Piece. Even though Luffy and co are pirates, they will help people because they are good people and value friendship. The Strawhat team pwn. Comedy. Yes there are some funny gags :) What makes One Piece suck? The 4kids dub or whatever. stay away from dubbed and stick to subbed. That's about it i really can't fault anything else.

"First of all, let me start off by saying that One Piece ! is one of my favourite animes and manga of all time, and before you decide to not watch it, read the reviews ! One Piece is by far the most outrageous, amazing, tear jerking, hilarious, life changing animes. It seriously makes me want to drop out of school and become a pirate. If you think that this is extremely shounen and that girls will not like it; you're extremely right for the first bit. I'm a teenage girl, and I swear, I would choose One Piece over every other shojo anime out there. Sometimes shonen animes are the best. [STORY] The story is intriguing from the very start. We see this little skinny kid who looks like nothing special, but then *BAM* he shows you what he can do. If you've read the summary, you'll get the jist, except that the summary leaves out one VERY important detail. DEVIL FRUIT ! These are basically fruit that give the consumer powers, and as you watch the series, you will see the most stupid sounding devil fruit, turning out to be the most powerful creation ever ! The story is funny, but is sserious at times. There are times when I cried my eyes out, and there are times when I died laughing. This anime is non-stop hilarity and can not be described any other way. [ART] The art for the first 200 episodes or so is not the best quality, but is still equally enjoyable. DO NOT COMPARE THE DUB ART TO THE ORIGINAL. It has been modified for children etc. and looks absolutely stupid. Eiichiro Oda's art is often compared to 'Fairy Tail' another shonen anime, but they are both amazing. The design of the characters is both funny and amazing. They are so unique and I know I would never be able to compare them to anything else. [SOUND] please note, this is for the SUB. SONGS are amazing, lyrics are truly heartfelt and funny. They set the story very well using songs and openings etc. Characters voices are magical, whenever I was reading the manga I had a clear idea of what the voices would sound like, and I'm happy to saw my expectations have been met. [CHARACTERS] BEST part of One Piece is how unique and special the characters are. They are not all 'my mother/father died when I was young and now I wander the seas', no, they are all truly heartfelt, sad stories that are only similar in how heart wrenching they are. Every back story, every flash back I had truly felt sad at, and it took an extra 3 episodes to un-break my heart ! [ENJOYMENT] If you haven't read any of my review, here's a basic shortened version of it; BEST. ANIME. EVER. [OVERALL] Simply the best. Couldn't ask for a better anime.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a6c8e75be,8,2607
"One Piece was the second anime show i stared watching(the first one being Death Note) and ever since i started i have been a huge fan of both the storyline and some specific characters. Story: The story of the series unveils around the main protagonist's main ambition to become the King of Pirates, in a world that is ruled by a mysterious government that has five elders at the top. The world of One Piece is unique. It bears no similarity to any other world i've seen in other anime shows, as it is mostly comprised of 5 oceans (along with the Grand Line, in which the treasure is said to be hidden). The man said to have the most freedom in the world is the pirate king because he is not bound by the militaristic government led by the organization of the Marines. And so Luffy sets sail in order to find new nakama for his crew and eventually become the King, with many adventures lying ahead of them. Art-Sound: The animation techniques could be improved but are quite nice nontheless. The OST's released for each season are quite amusing in my opinion and also quite famous in Youtube. Character: Probably the most astonishing domain in One Piece is the variety and complexity of the developed charactes. Since the beginning of the storyline many different and unique characters have been shown making it easy for any person to match themselves with one of them and become obsessed. The protagonist as well as hin nakama illustrate many moral issues and relationships such as friendship, protection of beloved one's, loyalty, trust etc. Also many difficult situations develop such as betrayal. However the combination of different and at all times strong-willed characters makes all of them wasy to like. Enjoyment: In my opinion anyone watching One Piece has a great time enjoying both the battles and the relationships developed between the characters. Many different abilities are shown via the Devil Fruits,which grant each person an ability. One can be eaten by each person. Until now over 100 different devil fruits ave been shown making the battles interesting and mysterious as one is eager to know the other;s fruit abilities and weaknesses. I would give the overall score of 10 to One Piece. It is probably my favourite anime due to its characteristics and the fact that i am obsessed with Luffy. I hope i helped with my review.

"I started it on August 2024 and finally finished it yesterday,as well as caught up to the manga by today.Yeah,I am the type that can't wait.It was a nice experience overall,but initially at the start i thought,can I even watch this? Should I wait for the WIT adaptation? but I am 21 already and WIT will take at the very least full 10-12 years to cover all arcs.By then I'll be a grown up with a family and have a hectic work schedule,so why not try it,I have watched many Isekai garbage,so maybe,at the very least it won't be trash,like I had bare minimum expectations and I always have the bare minimum expectations of anything in life,that is my way of life,cause if you live like this,life can surprise you and for this I must say it did.Now,my first point would be ,I did not expect to sob this much( like,I sobbed for a boat man...), honestly at the start it was unbearable,it seemed good when the story was flowing but the animation was making it hard to keep watching,until Alabasta,after which I became invested in it as more of an adventure story,which it actually is(In an adventure story payoffs come at a slow rate but it hits hard when it does)rather than a typical battle shonen(Payoffs and plot moves fast with new and stronger enemies one after the other)( I know it has those elements and plenty of it,but no battle shonen has ever focused on the small details and thrill and adventure part of the story than One piece has, meeting new people ,going new places and exploring almost different world ,especially after Marineford).So after Alabasta I enjoyed it to the fullest and just enjoyed the journey,I did get burnt out, stopping for a few days and then going cause I understood it's not a binge watching show, it'll take time and so I gave it the time.Now one thing to note is that although the story is grand and the world of One piece ever so vibrant and rich the pacing does get horrible and it's not the creator's fault, it's the company's.Many blame Oda,but he takes time for the plot to move in full motion and while doing so when the manga is animated,it looks like things keep on getting stalled.So as a new One piece fan i would say if you do start this magnificent story give it time,don't watch if you don't feel like watching,and stall it for a few days if you feel like you are getting burnt out,the plot does drag quite a bit.Or,you can wait for the WIT adaptation which will be an epic storytelling with no budget constraints and free flowing pace of the story and start your journey then.Now I won't say those things like this is a Masterpiece,peak or Oda cooks or whatever but I do implore you to join this amazing adventure and a grand story of epic proportions.You won't regret it.❤️❤️",9,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c4caa0d28f,8,2726

One of my most memorable moment was in the early episodes when Luffy got hypnotized and he started yelling in anger, and I thought the voice was so perfect absolutely hilarious. Thats how I got hooked. My main reason why I like One Piece so much is simply because there is so many episodes. Since I was new to One Piece early december of 2007, I did alot of watching in my spare time. It felt great, every episode I would get more attached and I didnt want it to stop.

"Right off the bat One Piece was not a series I was interested in. I found the art really bizarre, the amount of episodes off-setting, the slow pace of the story to deal with, and quite honestly the voice actor for Luffy annoyed the the heck out of me! However, after devoting my time to watching 650+ episodes of this magnificent series, a love I've never had for any other anime series has developed. I have given this series 7/10 even though is it by far one of my favourite series because it is not without its flaws. Story: 8/10 One Piece is by-far one of the most developed story lines I have ever witnessed conveyed through anime. The thing about it that places it above most other series is that we have a plain goal given to us at the beginning of the story that has maintained its focus throughout the entire series so far. It is a very straight-forward series, and the idea of the 'treasure' being at the end of the Grandline makes the whole series flow. What's more is that from this goal, more goals start to string off and in the end we have a story that has created a magical world of adventure. What I like to tell people when I suggest One Piece is to imagine the dream to become the Pirate King a straight line, and from this imagine every side-story (and there's A LOT!) pulling off from this line and developing its own line. It sounds completely confusing, but the story as a whole is fabricated to have a nice and easy-to-follow flow that still has plenty of room for surprise! Only the most thought-out story lines can maintain this flow. Needless to say, the anime is an adaption from the manga and as such it has its flaws. At times important hints given within the manga to help develop the story line go without animation. Which doesn't seem like a big issue, but overall it gravely lacks the mind blowing development to which the manga has. Furthermore, filler episodes tend to be the most bizarre arcs I have ever seen. There has been one or two filler arcs that has fitted completely well into the story and I would've thought they were canon; but in saying this the series also offers the most absurd filler ideas - and this accounts for about 80% of all filler arcs in the series. Some of the filler arcs are extremely painful to watch through. Overall, the general story line of One Piece is extremely thought out and planned, but due to anime adaption it has it flaws and therefore I give the story an 8/10. ART - 6/8 Straight up, one of the reasons why I was hesitant at first to begin One Piece was due to the art style. This is very common among anyone who comes across the series, and while some people might push past it, others may not overcome it, and others will completely avoid the series. I'm very picky when it comes to the art style of a series, and if I don't like it I will lack enjoyment for it as a whole. In saying this, One Piece has been probably one of the only series that I have learnt to love. After avoiding the series for years, I only attempted it out of boredom and even then I wasn't completely thrilled about watching it due to the art style. It's very different from everything else I enjoy, and sort of seemed off-putting. I'm telling you now - at least attempt to watch the series for a good run and see how you adapt to it. Most One Piece fans will tell you they disliked the art style at first also; however it's truly something you grow to love. After 600+ episodes, I couldn't imagine such a series full of adventure with another art style. The art style is what makes One Piece. To make it clear, I am not giving art a 7/10 for the general art style of the series, but rather because of how the series has been animated. Anyone who knows Toei (the animation studio) comes to understand that they tend to cut corners - even for a big time anime like One Piece. The art can be super sloppy, and poorly done to the point that it becomes laughable. Scenes that should have spectacular artwork are not given the detail to really bring out what the scene should encompass. Despite Toei's faults, all in all the series has a unique art style that sets it afar from the rest. Either you'll love it or you hate it - and however that may evolve depends upon the watcher. All I can say in this regard is the art style might surprise you. It did for me. SOUND - 10/10 The sounds and music in One Piece is one of my favourite things about the series. When asked whether someone should watch the anime or read the manga, I tell them they should do both despite the faults of the anime. The reason why is because I feel like the music, voice characters, and so on are so well done in this show that it really adds to the series as a whole for me. I could listen to all the openings in one day. Many of the songs in One Piece brings back memories for me, and a sense of nostalgia. All the songs are enjoyable, and will have you singing out the words in no time. They fit the atmosphere of the series - that being one of adventure and nakamaship. The choice voice actors (namely in regards to the Japanese sub) is extremely well done. Personally for me all the characters fit their voices! One thing One Piece fans love to laugh at is the unique laughs created for each characters - which I will promise you you will probably try it in private yourself! Like I stated before, at the beginning of the series Luffy's voice annoyed me. As I got more into the series, I became attached to it and couldn't enjoy Luffy's voice as anyone else. The voice actors are able to bring out the character's personality through their skills - which is why I tell people that it's worth it to watch the anime. CHARACTER - 9/10 For an expanding world of wonder comes with the challenge of characters. To have such a large set out, to have too few characters introduced would make the series feel empty and not lively enough. To have too many you risk characters who need development to be left under-developed. Unlike many other animes, the layout for One Piece is extremely large - that being basically the WHOLE WORLD. Even so, each character is given the attention and detail it needs. Minor characters are given minor development, and major characters (tend) to be given major development. Overall you can break the characters up in the series into several categories of importance: major, semi-major, minor and background characters. Those who are major being the crew, those being semi-major meaning the reoccurring characters who had the spotlight in a particular arc, minor being characters who were given detail in the slightest, and background characters being just that. It's a large field to cover, so the development has to be precise for it to be effective. Even so, characters are usually given the necessarily development to make you appreciate them. In particular the crew - all with their interesting and differing back stories - have each their own struggles and goals they wish to achieve. For each character it's a long run of endurance and change - and watching the process of each of these lovable characters becoming the people they want to be - whether slowly or quickly - is truly a journey. Despite this, it is wrong to say all characters in the crew are given the rightful amount of development they deserve. Some of the crew mates tend to be given the spotlight more so than others, and as such they are portrayed as lacking in that area. Needless to say, to say these crews aren't developed at all is also wrong. One thing I find admirable about the series is how so many differing and sometimes conflicting personalities are portrayed throughout the series - and how they develop not just individuality but between each other. Nakamaship is greatly emphasized within the series, and you'll be able to see how characters (mainly in the crew) interact with each other and form relationships. As the series progressed I found myself loving particular friendships between particular characters - think Zoro and Sanji, or the coward trio! It is extremely hard for any writer/author/etc to effectively develop characters in these areas, and when it happens recognition deserves to be given. Another cool thing I find interesting about the characters is how they are developed from real-life people. Most characters in One Piece of some importance you will find their roots into bigger inspiration in real life i.e. for example Mihawk from Dracula, or Blackbeard obviously from the legendary pirate Blackbeard. Of course these should be recognized to the manga's author, Oda; however, needless to say I believe the anime has done a great job in adapting them and portraying them how they should be. Thus I have given this area a 9/10. ENJOYMENT - 8/10 My enjoyment for the series tends to be lacking due to one issue: pacing. All the other cons are vastly overcome by the pros; however sometimes the pacing becomes unbearable. Having watched the anime first all the way to episodes 500-600 before I picked up the manga, the pacing never really got to me. It was there, without a doubt, and my first experience with the anime can tell you it took me a year to have the willpower to get past the first 20 episodes. This pacing is only emphasized once you start comparing it with the manga, and it gets to the point where you you may not be able to watch episodes without thinking about how it was paced within the manga - which greatly affected my enjoyment for the series. No doubt One Piece would be a large anime regardless of pacing, but needless to say the ratio of episode to chapter has certainly pushed the limits of episodes. While pacing remains an issue for me, I still believe the pros I have had for the series as a whole have provided me with one of the best anime experiences I have ever had. This series is definitely not without flaws. Some areas lack, but in saying this other areas shine. It's entirely up the individual experience on whether the cons over weigh the pros, or vise via; but personally the pros have given me an entirely fantastic experience that the cons simply can't take away. My enjoyment for this series is undeniable. OVERALL - 7/10 While this rating may not seem good and may reflect that One Piece is not a masterpiece as a whole, please remember I am simply a fan who has taken into account the problems One Piece has. One Piece - regardless of the cons I have reasoned out here - is one of the most memorable series. It is not for everyone, but I emphasize that it is not a series that you should dismiss without trial. The adaption isn't always on point, and things can be done better, but I adore this series and I hate seeing people passing it by due to silly reasons.",7,Recommended,"Feb 4, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3d532f5497,8,10673
"Hello All. Firstly let me say. This review is about the facts of the show. I will try to leave my personal opinon out of it until the end, because for one it's my favorite anime. What I hope this review does is give you some insight about the anime and what to expect. ==Story == Yes im sure youv'e heard of it. Monkey D. Luffy, an ordinary boy who ate a fruit of the ocean (devils fruit) turned into a rubber man. After being saved by his role model who is a pirate, he goes off to be the King of the Pirates. ==Anime Episodes== Firstly, there are three versions of this anime. The first being the Original Japanese version which I highly recommend. The second being the Funimation english dub version, which is the exact translation of the Japanese version. And lastly.. the dreaded 4kids version which should not be watched and burned on sight. (Sorry for that opinon but I think all one piece fans will agree) ==500+ Episodes OMG== Yes the anime is over 500 episodes long. But don't let the number scare you away. One piece tells a story with every single arc. Oda (the Creator) made the show in a way where you get the see what is going through the minds of every main character and enemy before the fight/struggle/adventure takes place. I warn you now. If you are looking for just pure action, READ THE MANGA. The anime stays true to the fights but, its an anime. They can't just catch up on the manga. So what do they do? They extend the fights, and the events before the fights. I think its great, but for some, it may seem as though the anime is dragging on. ==Artwork== Nowadays anime's are coming out in 1080p. One piece is older, so naturally the orignal episodes look older. But rest assured, by the time you get to Enes lobby arc, there will be a huge animation quality upgrade. Not opinion, fact. ==Character Development == Each character develops because they all have thier own personal goals and dreams as they travel with Luffy (or try to capture him). They all mature in thier own way. And when I say everybody I mean EVERYBODY. Again.. 500+ episodes. == Opinion == Watch it. Don't expect it to kick off into a action packed pew pew shoot em up fight until many episodes in. But what got me hooked was seeing his crew get through struggles, fight for their goals and life, seeing them face enemies that are sometimes stronger than thier entire crew put together, or more cunning than them. Seeing how a person who's only abilitly is stretching with some inhuman strength fight enemies made of elements such as smoke for example. Seeing the tears of thier crewmembers as they fight for thier friends. Truly, I found this anime to be moving, funny, and have some insanely INTENSE fights. This is also the first anime where I was rooting for some of the bad guys as well as good guys. I love luffy's crew, but some baddies are just... damn cool (Icy Cool in fact.) ==Closing== If your looking for an anime thats short, to the point, great kickoff, than this is not the anime for you. It's long, but enjoyably so. If DO however have time, patience, and in the mood for a good story with in my opinion GREAT rewards for sticking with it, than this is the anime for you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",10,Recommended,"Sep 17, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b2f3c6812e,8,3221
"Well after watching 500+ episodes and reading the manga I think this is a good stopping point for me to review the masterpiece of an anime-series which is One Piece. At this point it’s kind of cliché to even review this anime due to the massive number of reviews written so far but in reality I feel that one piece STILL does not get the standing ovation it deserves. And maybe the ridiculous and continued FAILED Americanisation attempts of it is to blame……well anywayz it still beats ALL anime-series to date. Animation In its early days it was drawn in a lets say a “misleading” comical sense that can present the series as slapstick, well the animation complements the idea of a simple comedy - which is so far from the whole picture. Intense battle scenes can make you think your watching the most serious and brutal of anime, combined with very distinctive facial expressions of laughter, anger, disgust, misery and every other colour of the rainbow - its actually refreshing to see this basic style of animation depict such a range of emotions. Over the years you can see more detail has been put into the simple animation design without any artistic compromise…a fantastic and unique feat in my humble opinion. *A Special shout out goes to all the Fan-subbing groups for adding fantastic graphical text for character special moves (Kaizoku fansubs, Vegapunk etc)* Sound Well..well Firstly…let’s start by just saying the original Japanese audio is flawless in every way Openings, Closings, Background & all voice actors PERFECT. Secondly & Sadly 4Kids entertainment have forever stained and ruined the one piece experience for countless westerners who sadly watched the horrific English dub and got a totally unreal one piece experience and although Funimation entertainment has taken over and re-dubbed it, its not only too late but still not up to scratch again. This just proves the fact that some anime just cannot be applied correctly to other regions without losing the spirit of the anime! Sorry for the mini-rant but the true one piece fans are just fed up! Japanese audio is perfect and English dub should be avoided like the swine flu! Story Again at first glance One Piece can appear to look like a slapstick pirate comedy but it’s so much more. Every character has a story in one piece and there are probably 100+ stories that could be told but the anime focuses on the ever growing Straw Hat Crew and each character of the crew. These stories usually involve a traumatizing childhood, a pivotal character related death and a goal for that character to achieve (told beautifully I might add). These stories are just brilliant and I must say out of all the long running anime series I’ve seen Dragonball, Pokemon, stupid Naruto and Bleach etc - One Piece just feels like there’s hardly any filler as all the episodes just seem to contribute to the straw hat pirates adventure! With exception to the historical special arcs found more recently which are mildly comical but not like 130 eps (STUPID-ASS NARUTO!!!) ahem. Characters As I said before One Piece has a HUGE number of characters From Crewmates, Marines, Civilians and SUPERVILLANS. Yep One thing One Piece does well is VILLANS these villans are the definition of pirates where killing attacking manipulating and even beating women & children is all fair play. The characters in one piece just tend to bring out the emotions in its audience Luffy will have you laughing and rooting for victory, Nami will have you wondering do all women love money this much and Zoro will have you saying should’nt this sword guy be in samurai champloo? Lol. Enjoyment One piece is easily the anime I have had the most pleasure enjoying in my anime career and I tend to use it as a pick me up emotionally, as most fans will tell you one piece has a very therapeutic quality to it..yep that’s a weird thing to say but if you agree with me chances are you hit the helpful button below this review. If I had anything bad to say about One Piece it is around the 300 Ep point I started to feel that the storyline would go in a repetitive routine that was starting to become a little bit too predictable – and just after I started feeling that way around the 400’s the entire series changes gears and shakes things up big time……so much for predictability! Value In my opinion one piece has something for everyone Action, Adventure, Comedy and trust me even though people don’t mention it this anime can actually bring ya to tears of sadness and most definitely tears of joy. Sadly I’ve noticed the sheer number of episodes steer many newcomers away thinking its too much of a commitment. This is one of the few anime I say makes me proud to be an anime fan its just One in a Million which NEVER fails to entertain! i would just warn people to not be fooled by its slapstick appearance and STAY AWAY FROM ANY AND ALL ENGLISH DUBBED VERSIONS OF ONE PIECE IT’S THE EQUVIALENT TO WATCHING POKEMON…actually that’s insulting Pokemon…sorry Ash!

"So, it's a shounen, a goofy and silly shounen indeed, but I think what it fills even better is being a prime example of what not to be. So the art. It's probably worse than any American cartoon I've ever seen. I mean, my little brother could draw better than that. Honestly it's more hysterical than anything because of how appallingly bad it is. Episode 1 started off with your eyes and ears bleeding, from both the terrible art to the terrible sound (and yes, I mean the screaming). That kid was screaming so loud I though his voice would break. But unfortunately, this did not happen. I have given this anime a total of 3 chances so far. Every time it has undoubtably let me down. It has now become a running joke amongst my friends, I guess it has that going for it.

"People often profess that this anime is the best they've ever watched, which led me to watch it myself. Big mistake. One Piece is easily the most overhyped anime in all of shonen. Let me explain why. Story (2/10): The story revolves around the most cliche plot in all of anime - Monkey D. Luffy wants to find the One Piece. However, the irony stems from the fact that in all 955 episodes of this show, he still hasn't managed to reach his goal, and continues to steer away from it through filler-like side quests that seem to hold no significance to the overall story. Art (1/10): Do I even need to explain? Every character looks like a stick figure with a stretched-out forehead. Sound (7/10): The sound fits the pirate theme of this show well, with smaller sound effects and music playing through during fight scenes being somewhat enjoyable. There are some times where the sound significantly adds to what is shown on the screen, although it doesn't stand out from other anime in any way. Character (2/10): This show lacks any major character development, especially with the main character, which makes many portions of the story completely pointless. While I haven't progressed far in the series, from the couple dozen episodes I have watched, there seems to be no chance of these characters changing in any way. Not to mention that the art style prevents the characters from displaying any form of emotion, due to their 2-dimensional facial features. Enjoyment (1/10): I think you can see why I gave this category a 1. Overall (1/10): As an anime, One Piece simply does not live up to the standards of the other shonen in its class (Naruto and Bleach), and lends itself to be extremely difficult to watch. I felt the want to drop the show after every episode but only progressed due to the praise of the show from others. Don't let the 8.50 rating fool you like it did me.

"This is my first review ever. :) One Piece is one of the best animes I've ever seen because it includes a great plot, amazingly funny characters(especially the main characters), and it has many episodes. Throughout the anime, Luffy, the main character meets different people who eventually became his crew mates to go on a journey to find a treasure called One Piece, but as you watch more and more, the plot gets more exciting, complicated, and you'll begin to become a bit anxious for the characters because stronger characters, that are stronger than Luffy, will appear.

"I stressed enough as this anime is only ranked 58 on the list(LETS GET ONE PIECE TO THE TOP GUYS) ive either gotten several negative responses when i mention One Piece 1- Its too long 2- (usually mentioned by fan-girls) Death Note FTW!(which i dont think it derserves to have such a high rating) 3- Ewww that anime is ugly 4- naruto/bleach is better 5- Ive seen the dub it sucks bawls Ill try not to write any spoilers and make it brilliant as possible Story 10/10 Luffy a young 17 year old, who has eaten the Gomu Gomu Devil Fruit making him a rubber man, aspires to be the Pirate King, his carefree personality makes him the main character of the story and we follow him and his crew on his path to being the Pirate King, the great arcs one ive loved much was the Enies Lobby arc which was quite amazing Unlike certain Animes which have no ability kill anyone off One Piece has plenty of such things making the Anime an emotional one. I remember when i was 9 the dubbed version by 4kids was absolutely horrid i remembered no blood or anything to being with One piece should get a a different dubbers infact without looking at the art to much or the voice acting i thought the story sounded quite great here i am watching it again 6 years later but this time on the subbed version, please don't watch the dubs, Art 10/10 So what if the art is funny looking it fits like a glove onto the type of this anime one piece is funny its meant to be funny it should be denied because of art style i mean its more then 10 years old as we progress in the story my current time is 2011 the art get clearer Sound 10/10 Every sound and background in one piece as id liked to imagine it fits perfect with the scene or current arc to make a scene sound badass or completely stupid Characters 10/10 every character in One piece has a back story a childhood not one character is left out its deeply thought about and very deep, in most flashbacks which every different character usually has all the stories connect, every backstory ive seen so far is very touching and emotional thus making make score a 10/10 Enjoyment 10/10 Every battle scene in One Piece is Badass they always somehow try to beat there opponent no matter what its a common theme but no matter how much stronger the opponent they always have a resolve.

"One Piece isn’t just an anime—it’s a complete experience. Among long-running series, it stands head and shoulders above the rest. While many shows lose momentum or direction over time, One Piece somehow keeps getting better, arc after arc. The story is incredible. What starts as a simple pirate adventure turns into one of the most complex, emotional, and well-crafted narratives in anime history. With over 1000 episodes, the plot never loses its core theme: freedom, dreams, and loyalty. Every arc feels meaningful, and everything connects in the bigger picture. I'd give the story a 9/10, only because the pacing can feel slow at times, especially in the anime adaptation—but the payoff is always worth it. Where One Piece truly shines is in character development. Every main Straw Hat gets their moment, their backstory, and their growth. Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Sanji, Robin—each one has depth and personal struggles that shape who they are. Even side characters get love. It’s no exaggeration to say this anime has some of the best character buildup ever written in anime. 10/10 for that alone. The animation, especially in recent arcs like Wano, is top-tier. Toei really stepped up their game, and the fluid fight scenes, color palette, and visual storytelling have reached a whole new level. Some older episodes may not hold up visually, but the newer content more than makes up for it. 9/10 overall. One Piece also blends every genre imaginable—action, adventure, comedy, drama, mystery, thriller, even a bit of horror and romance. It has emotional climaxes, epic battles, unforgettable music, and some of the most iconic moments in anime history. Whether you're here for the journey, the characters, the fights, or the world-building, One Piece delivers. It’s not just worth watching—it’s worth living through.

"To say I was reluctant at first to watch this show at first, was an understatement. I have only been watching anime a couple years now and didn’t know too much regarding this show. I had just finished all 720 episodes of Naruto, which I think is indeed inferior to this show but I still love it so and wanted to casually watch some smaller 12 episode anime. One of my closest friends had been going bonkers about this show and I decided to pick it up, against my original plan. What followed is possibly the greatest Shonen Jump show I have ever seen. The characters are incredibly fleshed out with rich, deep and compelling backstories, each fight against small pirate crew, big crew, marine, Yonko, etc matters to the overarching narrative, every arc feels like an interactive adventure and it’s beautifully portrayed with Toei's animation. The Summit War, Water Seven, Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island arcs are arguably some of the best in Shonen anime history. Currently at Whole Cake Island but my god, I cannot recommend this show enough, the time you invest in is absolutely repaid 100s of times over.

"""I don't want to rule anything. Being King of the Pirates is about being more free than anyone."" - Luffy. Genuinely a heart of gold. A masterpiece. Simply a 10/10. Is it too long for you to watch? Don’t worry about that—just watch the first two arcs and you’ll soon be saying, “How dumb I was to sleep on something so beautiful.” I really don’t want to overhype it, but the truth is this is a slow-pacing story that requires time to fully appreciate. My recommendation, based on my own experience, is to watch the episodes at your own pace. As for the story, the characters, the world, the crew—everything? One word: ""fictional peak.""

"One Piece is a masterpiece for me personally because I watch it twice from start to end. I have no regrets watching it twice, where it was full of emotions and it taught me a lot of things about life. There are a lot of episodes, but all of them are worth watching, so don't be scared to start right now. I can see that people will say that it has so many episodes that it feels like it is not worth it, but it has a lot of action where there are cool moments, funny moments, and so much more that I cannot put into words what I am saying. In my opinion, this anime might be number 1 because of all the cool things that each episode gives you. In this anime, it has everything: Do you want to see action, drama, and ecchi moments? This anime gives you that. There are episodes that made me cry for scenes it gives, and I never thought that literally I would cry about watching anime episodes.

"Overall rating: 6/10 Oh my goodness gracious please read the manga. I love One Piece so much, I believe it has some of the best storytelling ever. But the anime has just so many drawbacks for me. It's not like I hate the anime, there are some things that are great about it, like the voice actors and the suspenseful music. But the pacing. I seriously cannot gripe about anything else but the pacing. It is truly atrocious. It took me a good 2-3 months after watching the first 150 episodes to try and watch anime again. But when I finally did, I was in utter shock at how entertaining a show can be when it has even semi-decent pacing. After finishing the manga, I went back and tried to watch the Dressrosa arc in the anime, since I had been told by a few people, that it has some of, if not, the best pacing in the series, and it was still terrible. I do understand that building suspense can impact certain scenes a lot, and I also think that it can be amazing in the right moment, but it reached a point for me where I was wasn't sitting there in suspense, just itching to see what happens, I was bored, because it was taking so dang long for something to happen. To anyone who is considering getting into One Piece, I personally, would strongly urge you to read the manga instead. If you've never read manga before, I think this could be a decent choice to make your first too. I would also like to note, that reading the manga is way more time efficient. I am a college student and I can definitely take a 10-15 minute break and read a couple chapters, but a single episode will take 20 minutes and most of the time that episode only covered half of a single chapter.

"After considering other anime as my favorite I've decided one thing ""one piece"". Unlike other animes, you can just watch one piece and it won't stop! A big pro about this anime is it's length. As long as you have the time, you can watch a lot of it without worrying that it'll end soon. Another great thing is the storyline. There isn't one big storyline like other animes, this comes with arcs, an island with it's History and story, with the little storyline of what happends in the world of one piece. I've said to myself ""Okay I'm gonna watch this island again for sure!"" But after seeing the next one which is better ""No way! This is even better!"" And this is how it goes. The soundtrack- an awesome one, many themes for many situations. One piece started about 15 years ago, when the art was pretty ""bad"" but as the episodes pass the art is getting better. For those who watched Naruto and those with fillers, One Piece doesn't have many fillers and most of it are flashbacks. Movies!

"Main review and then recommendations for anyone looking to get into the series after (from someone who isn't a One Piece stan or a One Piece hater). I watched the main arcs via One Pace (like all new OP fans should), but have seen the pacing of the show in normal episodes as well. There is egregious padding to start and end nearly every episode (thus each episode is really only 10-12 min of new content) and there are several filler arcs that are unwatchable nonsense. As others have pointed out, the strengths of this show are countered by the abysmal pacing. Even though there are around 1,000 episodes out, if compressed and reedited to be reasonable, there would only be around 700, if not fewer. However, disregarding the unreasonable pace, it's clear why this show has so much of a following. The world is expansive, embraces different ideas of freedom, provides an imaginative structure of power (both the character power system of devil fruits/Haki and the world power subdivisions like World Government, Pirate Emperors, the Revolution Army), and is overall a strong mixture of light adventure and the brutalities of pirate life. If you're lucky to get into OP now, you don't have to wait and can breeze through strong arcs like Alabasta, Sky Island, Water 7, Marineford, and Impel Down. The current arc, Wano, is very strong as well, though incomplete. However, you'd be more lucky to get into this show in 10 years, since I can only imagine that's how long it'll take for Oda, the creator, to finish. As far as characters go, Luffy is a strong shonen protagonist, if not a typical one. Hopelessly daft, impetuous, strong, moral, compassionate, gluttonous- he shares perhaps one too many traits with Goku. The crew members are mostly fine but some have gags that have and will never be funny but which persist for some reason (Brook asking every girl if he can see their panties, and his ""I don't have x body part since I'm a skeleton"" thing). Nami, Zoro, and the newest crew member (as of Wano) are clearly the best, while Sanji and Chopper are the worst. Chopper is just there to sell merchandise. More on Sanji below. Villain quality drastically varies, from Crocodile, Enel, and Blackbeard at the stronger end, with Hody and Gecko Moria at the weaker end. The cast of characters OP has is impressive, even if some come up short. The world's scale is perhaps the best in anime. Female characters and how the male characters interact with them, however, is where the show is at its worst. Oda takes the grotesque and insidious body image standards of supermodels and goes even further with his female characters. Big boobs and waists thinner than their heads. Within the show itself, these characters are largely the object of a gross voyeuristic look, with Sanji and myriad other characters repeating the insufferable nosebleed horniness that should be totally removed from all anime. Sanji is easily the most cringe character in this show. Next, the plotting of the arcs can be repetitious and formulaic. Many major arcs involve this plot progression: arrival at a new place, the crew splitting up for some unnecessary reason, chance encounters by the crew build out the world (often where canon arc filler comes in), Luffy meets the most influential character in that place - typically a princess - by saving them from danger and thus accrues good will, Luffy and other major characters get captured, some previously befriended support character saves them, we learn Luffy's befriended character is extremely important to the history of the place, they escape from captivity after the main antagonist spills their plan like Dr. Evil, the crew reunites and hatches a plan, that plan fails but things fall in place anyway, Luffy screams the antagonist's name and stands up against injustice of that place, the characters match up with enemies of their skill level while defeating hundreds of grunts, Luffy battles main antagonist, the friends made along the way help Luffy and co. leave the place and/or protect them from capture. The arcs that don't follow this formula are generally the best plot-wise: Impel Down, Marineford, Water 7/Enies Lobby, Wano. Sound and Art: fine to good. Some episodes where the animators are padding includes horrible slideshow animation that tracks over static shots for like 10 seconds each. In addition, they give reaction shots to every single character present in order to give the appearance of actually animating when in reality it's just a sequence of still shots. The worst of this was in Fishman Island, probably the worst arc of the series. In the climactic moments of the series, including major battles, the animation is good to great. I don't pay as much attention to music as some on here, but the climactic moments do unfold to a strong score. Recommendations: While this will be blasphemy to the One Piece stans, I think a good portion of One Piece can be skipped. I would highly recommend checking out the many filler guides for OP online. I would not watch a single filler/anime-only episode; the only content worth watching is canon manga material. As a result, I would highly recommend watching One Pace, which reedits to agree with the manga- it's incomplete but still very helpful. For instance, Fishman Island ran 62 episodes while the One Piece reedit puts it at 24, with some episodes going around 30 min. Next, the Long Ring Long Land Arc, regardless of what anyone says, is filler and can be skipped in its entirety. I would also suggest watching all of Fishman Island at 1.5 speed and skipping any scene Hody, the main antagonist, is in. Lore is the only thing that matters in this arc, and everything that isn't teaching us about the ancient world is extremely boring. Besides these two warnings, every other major arc is important enough to watch (via One Pace). Finally, the level of enjoyment really depends on how much the filler and padding affects the experience, as well the arc in question. Like I said, I didn't have to contend with the insufferable pacing as much as others have and so enjoyed it more than most would if they watched all ~1,000 episodes without skipping. I really enjoyed the arcs previously mentioned, and was bored by a few. If I had to pick the most enjoyable arcs that I think represent the spirit of OP and validate its popularity, I would go with Sky Island, Water 7, and Dressrosa. I understand why OP gets both so much praise and why it should get even more criticism than it does. At its core, it is one of the strongest shonens but its strengths lead people to think it's perfect. It's not one of the best anime ever, but it's very entertaining when it's sticking to the main events, lore, and world building.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 11, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7f7151bedd,9,6723
"One Piece is one of the greatest things I've ever experienced. it is without doubt my favorite anime/manga. It has amazingly interesting and cool characters and a seemingly simple but grand plot. One of the things that I love about it are the characters. Some are just quirky but many others are very well written and interesting. One Piece has an extensive variety of good characters that just make the whole One Piece universe even better than it already is. I could go for hours thinking about different battles that could have happened in different arcs between different characters that would have completely changed the series. My favorite character is Doflamingo and he is really cool because he is crazy and he just doesn't care about anything but his goals which is really awesome. Another great thing about One Piece is the artwork. I like the artwork because it is a very good at most parts. The first 500 episodes have good art but after that it gets kinda messed so I would recommend reading the manga after that point. Another great aspect of One Piece is its music. When something is going down with Luffy a really epic song will play and it will get you really hyped for the coming battle. Just thinking about these songs gives me chills because of what was going on when they were playing. It also has very good openings and endings that are amongst the best I've heard. One Piece's story is seemingly simple: Luffy is searching for the One Piece. It is not as simple as it seems though. Each arc has its own unique theme, appeal, and characters. each arc immerses you into that islands world and keeps you very entertained. Also each arc builds up on the last one to make a very grand story. With all these things combined it makes One Piece have something special that I have yet to see in anything else anime, TV series, and movies.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_066016be22,9,1852
"At the risk of losing all my readers, let's start with some math. Four hundred and fifty episodes, roughly thirty minutes each, comes out to 13,500 minutes, with some generous rounding. There are 1,440 minutes in a day, meaning that would take over nine days to catch up to the latest episode of One Piece if you start from episode one and never sleep. It takes some extreme dedication to get that far; such dedication that, in fact, it should pointless to ask me what I thought of the series. The numbers can't lie: I loved it. I have dedicated half a year of my free time between work and High School to this anime, and it was consistently one of the highlights of my week. I don't think you should just go watch One Piece; I think you should go watch One Piece right now. I have joined a large chorus of fans and writers online who will all tell you with the zeal of a cultist that this series is awesome. This is the creme de la creme of shounen series, it has reached the zenith of what anime can do several times over, if you even think you can make the time to see this, you must at least try. And our voices are so loud and so strong... ... that a perfectly natural reaction from someone who hasn't seen this series, or has seen some of it and didn't care to continue, is skepticism. After all, I'm talking about a cartoon about a rubber pirate who acts like he's five years old. It's essentially just another shounen fighting series for 11-year-olds; it hardly seems like the Citizen Kane of anime. Hyperbole in the name of exuberance can have the odd effect of putting people off, and spending over hundred hours on anything requires a lot of exuberance. That skepticism is understandable, especially since explaining what makes this series work might not sound all that different from why people enjoy Bleach, Naruto, or similar series. So let's start with something we can all agree on- visually and conceptually, One Piece is a unique series. Anime is littered with ghost hunters, ninjas and teenagers endowed with mystical powers inspired Eastern mythology, but Oda hit on something special when he came up with the idea of 17th century pirates with superpowers. And that's really the beginning of One Piece's creativity. For such a long series, a constant flow of creativity is a must, and Oda has generally shown that he is up to the challenge. One of the conceits of the series is that each island the characters travel to is a strange world unto itself. One island could be under the thumb of tyrannical mermen, another a mystical island where it always snows, and still another where all the plants and animals have grown to be really l o n g. It's wonderful world building, but not in the sense that it's carefully crafted like Fullmetal Alchemist. It's more like a child's glee at making things up as she goes along. Unlike most shounen series, where superpowers and wonders have some kind of pseudoscientific explanation, the series follows an unrelenting dream logic that it doesn't explore very deeply. Why does eating a fruit that gives you superpowers also mean you can never swim? It just does, dammit. It's a refreshing change, and it keeps the sense of wonder intact for many episodes. Take the superpowers our heroes wield. Luffy is a kid who ate the Gum Gum Fruit, and now is a rubber man: literally, a man made of rubber. That sounds like the start of a bad joke, but in One Piece, it's a potent power that leads to some crazy, awesome, and crazy awesome fights. He can take a lot of damage, and since his rubber fists and feet can stretch to huge lengths, he can give as good as he takes. One of the main villains, Buggy, ate the Chop Chop Fruit, so he can divide his body however he pleases. And there are many more, and for over three hundred episodes, we are constantly introduced to wave after wave of new characters with strange abilities that range from the silly to the sinister, and, sometimes, are even both at the same time. And one of the small delights of the series is that when our heroes get strong by developing their powers, they break from the shounen formula of ""defeat - training - victory."" No, the characters develop their skills on the fly- they make it up as they go along. This burst of creativity lasts so long and is so strong, that when the anime does finally bring back some old characters beyond the core cast, it's a bit of a disappointment. Of course, for the series to be any kind of success, these characters would have to be better than your garden variety heroes. They'd have to be characters you could care deeply about and watch develop beyond what crazy things their powers do. Luffy can't become the Pirate King by himself, so he brings along a ragtag group of people he befriends in his travels. Though the small crew keeps adding new characters, there's roughly five core members: Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji. While you could safely describe each of these characters by whatever their particular kook is- Sanji is the cook who loves the ladies, Nami is the domineering navigator who loves money, Zoro is the samurai swordsman who wields three blades and sleeps all the time, Usopp is the sniper who tells outrageous lies- but that doesn't quite do them justice. They develop and grow close to each other, reinforcing the anime's central theme of friendship. The cast is probably One Piece's greatest strength, because when the story lags and things slow down, it's still a pleasure to spend time with the Straw Hats. I would hold them up to any of the great crews of anime, from Lupin, Urusei Yatsura, or Cowboy Bebop. And save a kind word for the villains: after all, what's a good hero without one or a dozen great enemies? They are all hateful bastards who deserve to get their face smashed in. It's a delight to see it happen every time. The concept of One Piece is very open ended; ""Boy tries to be the Pirate King"" leaves a lot of room open for how that could happen. Appropriately enough for a series about a long odyssey, the series has been leisurely working its way towards an ending. So far, the anime has covered about five major story arcs, some of which have several mini arcs. It starts out with short, mostly silly stories that are quickly resolved, but as we get to know the characters more and the world opens up, it gradually, confidently builds towards high drama with some epic storylines. Two examples stand out: the Alabasta Arc and the CP9 Saga. The Alabasta Arc starts shortly after the core of the crew is assembled and spans over fifty episodes. It's a big, meaty storyline with conspiracies and secret identities, rebellions and politicking, and has one of the most effective villains I've ever seen in anime. It's only topped many episodes later, with the epic CP9 Saga. This one spans a hundred episodes and is a more emotional viewing, and it's where the Straw Hats show the most growth. I really mean it when I say One Piece has the elusive ""spirit of anime."" As a series, the serialized storytelling has a lot of impact that builds from episode to episode, and shows extensive planning for arcs a couple hundred episodes in advance. It's one of the few series that can only be realized in animated form, and it has so much impact because of its extreme length. And it may be nowhere near finished. When recently asked how close the manga was towards completion, which the anime sticks very close to, Oda estimated that he was about halfway finished. And while he's known to be a jokester in interviews, I don't know of any reason not to take his answer at face value. And while recent episodes haven't quite lived up to the same level as earlier, since Oda has started to dip more often into the pool of Shounen Jump cliches, it says a lot that my reaction to this news was happiness. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Feb 17, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e44c3125fb,9,7806
"Before I start reviewing this series , I would like to just say one thing. The anime does the manga LITTLE TO NO justice. In this review , I would be comparing the anime to its manga counterpart. How should I put it ? The closest words that I can find to describe this anime is probably , horribly-paced. Disclaimer : All of this are my personal opinion and is not intended to offend anyone by any means. Story : 7/10 In regards to the storyline , I'm generally okay with it as unlike the other two popular shounen series like Bleach and Naruto , One Piece has little fillers (don't even get me started on Naruto please). And the anime follows the manga almost strictly in terms of storyline. I would have given it a higher mark if not for the animators screwing up the Hody VS Luffy fight. It made Luffy look superbly WEAK. Art : 2/10 One Piece is generally infamous for it's simplicity in its drawing and many people simply cannot get used to this , often irked by it compared to other animes/manga with great character designs and such. However , since the anime follows the manga , I will not fault the anime for this. However, what's really nerve-wrecking is that the animation and drawing is shit. Pardon me but yes. Just one look at the Sabaody Archipelago arc almost gave me cancer literally. I guess that's what happens when all the senior animators are dispatched to work on the movie and the juniors are free to do with the anime. I could still list a bunch of arcs with simply horrible animations that looked as though the animators wanted to be just be done with it and that's all. (Fishman arc for example ; biggest let down of 2013 after all the finishers looked like shit) Other than that, hardly any animation in this series is worth-noticing. Sound : 6/10 The soundtracks are generic and the only ones that really stands out from the rest is probably The Very Very Very Strongest and Luffy's Fierce Attack and maybe Giant Stronghold Takeoff. But just these three tracks itself is not able to carry such a long anime and it gets seriously repetitive after awhile. As for the openings and endings, sorry to say but I'm not a fan of any except for Share The World. I would have given it somewhere along 3/10 if not for the voice actors. The voice actors themselves. All I can say is , hats off to them. Let's start with the notable mentions. Luffy - Godlike contagious laughter and epic speech (very very very rarely). Job well done for voicing the goofy Luffy and I wouldn't be able to find anyone else that could possibly do a better job than Mayumi Tanaka. All I hope is that the voice actor lives to voice the remaining of the series (not cursing but she's getting old and the series still have a long way to go) Zoro - Needless to say , epic speech , epic speech everywhere. There's something about his voice that makes almost everything he says so much more epic than any other character would. "" I got on the wrong ship. -_+ "". Probably the only character that can make something that silly sound cool. Legit. Usopp/Sogeking - Do I even have to elaborate? This guy is freaking hilarious along with a contagious laughter and his awful screaming. And oh , the most memorable scene ? Arabasta and Enies Lobby speech about Luffy. Nuff said. Sogekinguuuu!! Chopper - This is a honourable mention because I cried at his past. No joke and his voice actor who happens to be the same seiyuu for pikachu did an extraordinary job voicing him especially during drum island. You could feel the sheer emotions coming out from her voice when Chopper starts to cry. Brook - YOHOHOHOHOHOHO! The rest of the characters were pretty average or nothing note-worthy. (Buggy is an exception to this though). This is the reason why the sound gets a 6/10 instead of a 3/10. Character : 8/10 Like the manga series, each character are given a single arc to tell their past and such. After that , each character slowly gets developed and there are evident character development. One notable example would be Zoro who told Luffy when they first met that if Luffy were to do anything to hinder him from becoming the world's strongest swordsman , he would kill him. However as time passed , Zoro began to respect Luffy as the captain and would even lay down his life for him if needed (when against Kuma). Each character is also diverse and unlike other anime series that have a huge cast , all the characters are not just a vase as they contribute to the series greatly as well instead of just giving one liners just to show their 'presence'. Enjoyment : 3/10 The enjoyment of this anime , sadly to say , does not live up to the story and character because of the crappy art that really put me off. But that's not the worst thing , it's the pacing that killed this anime. Toei strictly abided by it's ground rule that an One Piece episode must follow exactly one manga chapter which probably caused this downfall of a great series. Although the manga is well-paced, with the author taking seldom breaks because of his family and health issues, the anime did no justice to it because of the ridiculously slow pacing. And because of the pacing , the Whitebeard war that was absolutely amazing in the manga turned out like shit in the anime. The art was pretty decent there but the pacing.. oh god. I think I heard Luffy screaming Ace's name for over thirty episodes and a part of me simply just died. If only if the anime could pick up the pacing and do probably something like 1.5chapters/episode, or maybe improve on it by adding additional dialogues for each character which I definitely would not mind instead of showing characters running around doing nothing or FLASHBACKS. That would be great. Don't get me started on the censorship please. Overall : 3/10 It's a shame that I would have to give this great series such a low grade but as things stand. It's not worthy of any higher marks in my personal opinion. Unless the anime can do something about the horrible pacing , this is the final score I would give this series. And yes, I'm heavily biased against the anime because it simply does not live up to the manga like most animes. For those that have not check the manga out , do it and you would probably find better enjoyment than wasting twenty minutes each week just staring at characters running about doing literally nothing and the plot progress like a snail.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 24, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a83f26aad5,9,6367

"This is a new review; I found out after watching 29 episodes of One Piece, I realized I made the original review too early. Okay first off; Story: The story of One Piece is so much different to everything else I've watched, I like One Piece and gave the story an 8 because it's something I myself haven't seen something as planned out and consistent as this, although it has major flaws, for example the fillers... I'm kind of happy I haven't waited week-by-week to watch the 319 episodes I have currently watched, I would of been disappointed to of been given 3 months worth of filler... Although; some of the filler episodes are very interesting and actually make you want to watch them, namely during the Enies Lobby Arc, I will not mention anything that can be classed as spoilers so I'll leave the story section of this review here. The art, On my first review I found the art to be very poor; not realizing that One Piece was released in 1999(The Anime) so I gave this a very low rating the first time, but as I have gotten further on with the story I have noticed many changes to the art and fighting styles all of the characters use and how much it has improved, and I'm not even up-to-date with One Piece, I literally can't wait to see the complete development of this series, although waiting every week for this show will be a killer.I rated the new art style an 8. The sound; I found the opening theme tunes well fitted for this series and a lot of work was put in, Usopp's songs and so-on so forth. The Opening theme tune is very catchy for every arc and makes you enjoy watching them from start to finish, it kinda makes you feel like watching more and more every time you hear it. The sound was rated an 8. Well, not on to the second most vital point of any anime I watch and write my reviews on... The Characters, I find the character development for One Piece amazing, you learn about every one of Luffy's Nakama's past and how they ended up where and how they are, wanting to achieve their goals and will stop at nothing to do so, and with Luffy as the captain, who says that's impossible?! This section I rated 9, as I have thoroughly enjoyed watching every character develop and seeing what they turn out like and how they can overcome the impossible on a daily basis. It's finally time, this is the most vital point in any type of anime you can watch - Enjoyment, with this whole series, the first 50 or so episodes, I thought about stopping; reaching a certain landmark and just carrying on when I can be bothered, I'm glad I didn't do that. This has instantly become a favorite of mine, making me WANT to watch more and I just enjoy watching almost every episode, I rated the enjoyment factor for One Piece a 9. Overall: 9 I have given the overall summary of One Piece a 9 in my opinion, it's so amazing that I didn't think I would like this show; I took it on with a whim and I don't regret that one bit, One Piece teaches you so many life rules, abiding by your own justice and doing what you feel is right and not what the world thinks of it, if you think it's right, go at it whole-heartedly and you won't be disappointed with yourself, Luffy believes in his friends and Nakama to the bitter end knowing they are capable of overcoming everything and I find that the deepest bond between them all, it just sets everything in motion. I have enjoyed re-writing this review; I will leave my old review below for comparison for people wishing to judge One Piece too early, like what I done. -This review was wrote on Nov 7th 2013- ""With this show, I've found that the art-work isn't as what I personally expected, I find that other long running shows have much better artwork, for example Bleach, or Naruto... Although I've only just started to watch this series, I can't see the artwork changing too much. I find that the story plot is quite impressive, looking for the most valuable treasure in the land on a huge journey, gathering members, and as of what I've watched, it's a decent pace for a long running, as it has been going since 1999, which is impressive in itself, 14 years?! That is a a standard in itself. I found the characters very interesting, like I said, I'm a new watcher so getting to know the characters very early is a good thing, the way Luffy obtained his most precious treasure and Zoro started to learn his three sword technique and their goals. I found that to catch my attention, and a lot of thought was put into these episodes explaining their pasts. I used to dislike the thought of watching One Piece, but I have eagerly changed my mind, last year I watched 3 episodes, got bored and switched it off, I have came back (Was looking for some new stuff to watch) and I don't regret it, I have enjoyed this show - Only on episode 29, but started 3 days ago(4th Nov 2013). I have rated the show an overall 9. I am enjoying it, but the thing I am most let down by is the art work, I understand that for a 1999 production, this is probably a lot more advanced, and brings me back to the times I watched Tenchi Kyo-Ryo-Ohki or, a personal favorite of mine; Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari, they were, and still are excellent shows, even with their artwork, and I hope this turns out to be the same. Thank you for reading, I hope this is helpful to anyone looking to watch this anime.""",9,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_73160475ab,9,5328
"Brief overview: It's worth watching, but it requires a lot of patience due to the massive amount of episode Story 9/10 The story has a lot of emotional, funny, and epic moments, but it suffers a similar issue to most long-running shonen series where most of the content is focused on fighting and the one that is outside of fighting the content is generally quite good. So the story sets in a world of pirates, there was once a pirate called Roger who claimed the greatest treasure ever known as one piece ever since then he is known as the Pirate King. One day the main character decides to set out for an adventure to gather a pirate crew and find the legendary treasure one piece. Characters 8/10 The characters in the one piece universe is great and colorful characters. They are shown very different compare to most anime and most of them have a different and unique personality/ However, there is a problem, most character design looks weird and are extremely tall for some strange reasons/ They are not bad characters, but are strangely designed in some way. Animation 5/10 At times the animation is good or perhaps one of the best in the anime industry, but there is so many times where the anime looks from bad to worse. So it's a very coin-flipping experience as the animation can look bad yet good at the same time because the anime has been handed down from different animators which some of them can not keep up with the consistency of the anime. Sound 4/10 I normally don't add sound into anime reviews, but seriously the sound of this anime is bad. This is because ok at first if you listen to it is not that bad and kinda standard, but they have been using the same sound effect for 10 years straight now and it gets to the point that is tedious and annoying. Like punching, sword slash and jumping it is so tedious to hear the same sound over and over again. For fuck sake add new sound effect even the long Hiatus Bleach don't have this much copy and paste sound. TLDR Overall is worth watching, but it takes a lot of patience because the story is so long and it takes many episode to fully understand one segment of the story. The characters are lovable and cheerful, but has a strange design towards it and the animation is a coin-flipping quality as some looks good yet some looks bad. The sounds does hugely impact the anime because they have been using the same sound over and over again which it gets very tedious to watch.",8,Recommended,"Aug 30, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2800ee7ec3,9,2447

"Sit comfortably in your chair and enjoy this excellent review :) FOR EVERYONE WHO HAVENT STARTED ONE PIECE YET, PLEASE DON'T TORMENT YOURSELF. One piece is not worth watching from my point of view. I utterly despise this anime for its lack of everything except the plot. Let's start with the arguments proving that one piece is not worth watching. First and foremost for majority of the people it is awfully long, the pacing is tedious and revolting. Frankly speaking instead of 1065 episodes it could fit into 700episodes. Let's move into the characters, there is paltry amount of them who are not cheesy and you can even like them (for example zoro or law), nevertheless the rest is as exasperating as hearing gomu gomu no every 15 seconds in literally every fight. The most prominent and extraordinary villain is Big Mom, which is patricularly appalling. Next thing that is objectively repugnant is character design. It is by far the least pleasing feature of One piece. Some characters are designed pretty good (for example zoro, kaido or katakuri) but unfortunately the vast majority is build extremely atrocious. Btw, I dont know how exactly aging works in One piece world because it is interesting that people throughout decades literally change their entire anatomy and grow for example massive heads or shrink from 7metres tall to 1.5metres with distorted bodies. The show is utterly repetetive, 9 out of 10 arcs are designed is 1:1 way, arriving at certain island, at first having fun then finding out about the horrific history of the island and then rescuing the island from bad people. Obviously this anime has plot armor and the actions of Luffy lead to basically no consequences whatsoever. The fights are mid as the can be except the most recent ones where the animation is really pleasant and alluring. Ultimately there is only thing worth praising and it is plot. The plot is amazing, as biased against one piece I can be I resolutely find the plot as complex and entertaining.

"ONE PIECE !! Words cannot describe how much this has affected me and how much I love it. I am editing this review because I feel like I haven't wrote even NEARLY enough for my personal favorite anime. If you think I didn't watch enough animes to make that statement well no. I have watched quite a lot. I hope this review encourages you to watch it. And for anyone who thinks it's childish I can just give you one Youtube video that will clear it all up. It's called 'One Piece in 10 minutes' and its my favorite Youtube video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMa3868D41k The story and plot start off basic (just a guy becoming the best of the kind aka pirate king) you can't deny that but as it builds up it's really one of the most fascinating, epic, interesting, creative things i've ever seen so a 10 there. Music wise I STRONGLY believe it has the best music along with Naruto (both) closely beating Pokemon, Fairy Tail and Bleach's music. Openings and endings (it stops having them after a while) are perfect. So definite 10 there.And if you don't think so then here another Youtube video.This one 'One piece best osts' and it has all the best one piece osts- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g5-FuoN7YY Art is SUPERB. Every island the strawhats visit are SO unique and fun. There's a lot of fun gadgets,weapons, devil fruits and such getting revealed here and there which just adds to the thrilling and pleasureful art. The animation I can't say much about since it's different each arc. My favorite animation though is the animation in Sabaody arc and East Blue Saga (a lot of people hate its animation but I LOVE it. It's very nostalgic). Then there's the extra stuff in the art (I can name a lot) but one example of what i'm talking about- a river with bunny shapes ! Some of the character designs are weird (Hachi, Bon-clay) but still it's unique while some have such awesome (again unique) character designs (Kuma, Moria, 3 Admirals, Doflamingo). The characters are some of the best i've seen as well. The main characters are Luffy (the MAIN main character you can say) and his pirate crew (who look NOTHING like the stereotypical pirates). They all have such emotional and heart-wrenching flashbacks that you pretty much INSTANTLY start to appreciate them. I myself love the heck out of all the strawhats but you 'might' not think the same. 10 character wise. But the main characters are DEFINITELY not the only reason Now some extra reasons as to why it's so awesome. There are SO many epic moments that will leave you with epic-gasms the size of Russia, SO many sad moments that will leave you crying your eyeballs off and SO many heart-warming moments which feels like your heart is being warmed up in a sauna and being massaged 24/7. I can keep babbling about them but even when i'm done I would NOT have covered even 1/3 the 'scenes' that make One Piece so amazing. Not to mention the powers are freaking awesome.The concept of obtaining the power are devil fruits. It's kind of stupid I know, getting powers from eating a fruit but you get used to it. The devil fruit gives you a wide range of powers.From being able to create nets to turning into leopards to turning into someone who can create earthquakes an cause cracks in the air. There's just TOO many!! Plus it has my favorite power of all time - rubber (yes Luffy's devil fruit power). And there are other unique powers too. SMOKE is one. It's only missing romance. But that's not important partly because we have Sanji. So that's not a flaw AT ALL in my book. So yeah for now I can't think of any flaws with this anime other than say the length and filler which aren't that big to me (I will soon mention why). Now I will counter the flaws people say it has- The animation for the beginning is bad. NO it's not. that was made somewhere near the 2000s so OBVIOUSLY the animation back then is not going to be very good. But it has the best animation for back then(my opinion). Too many FILLERS. I myself do watch SOME fillers. Fillers that I think I might enjoy. One Piece actually has some really awesome fillers though (again my opinion). Anyways fillers are not a problem for me because well I skip them. I type in 'list of One Piece fillers' in Google. Then it's easy to go from there and I know what episodes are filler and that I need to skip. Too long. Like with all big series there is no RUSH for you to finish watching it (atleast that's what it is for MOST people). It took me 3 months to catch up with it but I took the time (I am busy most of times). An whenever I wasn't busy I marathoned it. An plus I myself like it long. If something's good then wouldn't you want more of it? If you are not giving it a chance or have watched like 2 episodes and don't like it then watch these episodes- 1-3 (they are not that good but it's just for an introduction to the show), 4, 24, 26, 35 and 36. Then resume from episode 5 once you know you will love the series. This is the longest review I did but its worth it getting my opinion across about what I believe to be the greatest 'thing' ever. I have more reasons for giving it a 10 but you might not and probably won't relate to them. there may be some reasons here you might disagree with me for but I hope you get the OVERALL message as to why I gave this 10/10. So keep watching it cause 'it be one of the most fuscinaten things you'll eva see in the deep blue of the sea'. And maybe you'll even think it to be 'the greatest and most fun adventure of your life', just like I do. Overall rating- Gazillion/10.",10,Recommended,"Mar 24, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_19a9eff7b1,9,5541
"Without going into spoilers too much I will give my review of One Piece. Characters and Story The story revolves around the main protagonist Monkey D Luffy who aims to become the king of the pirates. And along with him will be the other Straw Hat members who you will meet as you go along the series. The main cast for One Piece is pretty good as they have unique personalities from each other as well as their own fighting styles, powers and abilities. They also got some good backstories which can make you feel and care about them. What they do lack however is development because Luffy does not really have any throughout the series even though he does have a very likable personality and the others only seem have quite a bit of development within the arcs they are introduced in. The side characters you meet within the arcs are good as they may have some good backstories and do develop. The villains are not bad either since they can have an interesting personality and backstory however they kinda lack something which makes you believe whether they actually pose as a real threat to the straw hats and I should state that there isn't a lot of deaths in One Piece which lowers the sense of danger a bit. As for the story it does really well as it has a deep story with many subplots to them which relates to the world building which is also great that comes from within the arcs with the islands they explore as they also go into some themes. Plus there are not a lot of plot holes or inconsistencies so it is well written for the most part. Now if I were to belittle One Piece's story I could say that there is this plot formula which goes like this ""Luffy and crew goes to island, they become friends with a few residents there, have a decent understanding of what goes on within the island, villain starts wreaking havoc, Luffy and crew beat the villain and happy ending, then they go to a new island, rinse and repeat"". However that does not change the fact that One Piece has a great plot. Also I should mention that One Piece does have slow pacing so within the grand scheme of things, there might not be that much progression as the anime usually does 1 chapter per episode and it is apparently halfway through the story although I believe its more 2/3. Action One Piece has some pretty nice fights and the better ones usually come from Luffy, Zoro and Sanji. The animation usually moves fines for it and has some good sound effects for it. Also there is a huge variety of abilities within One Piece and they can get pretty creative with the devil fruits, haki and other techniques as well as some fighting styles. I wouldn't say they have the best fights in anime but that's all subjective and go around with it how you will. Comedy The comedy in One Piece is very good as the show does have this overall lighthearted tone which mainly comes from its comedy and it goes well. I also would like to say that One Piece does well to balance the tone between comedy and seriousness. Sound The soundtrack for One Piece is solid because it really does make it feel like a pirate theme adventure. So don't expect some rock or techno within One Piece's soundtrack. The sound effects for One Piece are great with the attacks, motion, etc. Art style and Animation At first the art style would seem very childish and silly, however you will eventually get use to it and even start to appreciate it since the art style is unique and anime for the most part has a similar art style. The animations are fine, don't expect something like Madhouse quality animation because since its a very long series, they won't have enough budget to make all the episodes top notch so its fine for what it is. And it can be very good in some scenes. Overall Conclusion One Piece is a very good series that is worth getting into. Its not perfect and has some flaws but the since there is a lot to like in One Piece, the positives outweigh the negative so they won't be much of a bother for the overall experience. Although I would say it is better to marathon the series rather than watch it weekly as I have stated the pacing is slow so not much would happen if you are watching weekly.",8,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a653a6f3a6,9,4173
"I would enjoy this if i were a 6 years old who have to choose between this and teletubbies. My huge problems with this anime: 1# Art: Yeah it's the worst, still after the time skip. It's good for a kid's show for 1-10 years olds. 2# Story: Simple and irrelevant. Just an endless and overstretched journey. 3# Characters: Retarded main character who has a 5 years olds mindset even in life and death situations. Support characters and bad guys are more interesting until they turn into irritating idiots. For example: Weddinguu Caaakyyyy!!!!!!!! over countless episodes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) #4 Pacing: Did u know? The legendary pirate Gold Roger... -_-"", then 5 minutes from the previous episode, then overstreched let's look eachother and i will deafeat you just because i'm a main character! Flashbacks from 2 minutes ago. And when finally a little process starts... {it will continue} #5: Humour: Cringeworthyfacepalmgenerator... #6 Enjoyment: If i were a masochist i would rate it 20/10. I started to watch this because a friend requested it to me, it will be worth watching after a few episodes he said, also the ,,Marineford ark will be the best"".

"When I first heard about one piece I was nearly overflown with the hype the fans were giving it, saying it was the best thing ever, that anyone who dares to call themselves an anime fan should at the very least reconsider watching it, or either the haters would complain that this 600+ series has been pushing themselves forward way to long and just need to end already. I gave this series a try, evenually I got hooked up so bad, I watched the entire series in just a spawn of 3 months, and all I got to say about it is, I absolutely love it. don't even doubt about the fact whether you want to watch this show or not, watch this show right now, this instant. one piece is literally for anyone out there, children, teens, adults, male, and even female may enjoy it undoubtely. one piece is one of the best shounens out there, and has all his right to earn this title. the writers succeed in knitting this long running story so well together that it just fits perfectly. every introduced character plays it's part, everything that happens has a value, may it be momental, huge or even way later in the future of the show. this show doesn't understand the concept of exaggerating, may it be of the wacky character personalities, designs, the downright crazy devil fruit powers, wacky islands, inhuman myths and introduces you to crossdressers, mermaids, fishmen and giants in the show like it's the most normal thing ever. characters: the characters in one piece most definitely has to be one of it's strongest points. the main characters are so well developed that it's impossible to hate any straw hat pirate. from the easy-minded but pure hearted rubber captain ,Monkey D luffy, to the headstrong loyal swordsmen ,roronoa zoro, from the wimp sniper ,usopp who later slowly but surely develops in a dependable and strongwilled crewmember, the characters which are introduced in the spawn of the series surely aren't left out either. one piece expands from a variety of all different kinds of characters and backstories which all in all are unique on their own, from the way they speak, laugh, how they behave, their ideals, every character is memorable and they own carry their own value to the evenual story. art: though, I gotta confess that I honestly had to get used to the art of one piece at first. the mouths were way to weird for me, the females were way to thin, and some features seemed to be rather bad. after a few episodes it just eventually stopped bothering me, after you got used to it you don't even know why you would dislike it in the first place. it's just another segment to make one piece more unique and if you're in the story more deeper you end up simply enjoying it. I can understand that some people don't have the ability to get used to it, but don't let it bother you one bit. you won't regret it. Music: it ain't yuki kajiura material, but it also isn't necessairy. the music fits in the background of one piece just perfectly, some BGM are memorable and just downright beautiful/epic. everytime I listen to the soundtrack used for a sad moment in enies lobby arc I start sobbing again. enjoyment: one piece is one of the best series I have ever watched in my life, out of all the anime I've watched, this most definitely is my favorite. it's unique, enjoyable, it makes you push your nose against the screen in the exciting moments, it succeeds to make you sob in the sad moments, this series is most certaintly a long one, and hasn't dried out in the least bit, and also won't be up until the very end. do you need to watch one piece? hell yeah you do. and why: because you're missing out of a whole lot, if at the very least you don't wanna reconsider watching this masterpiece.",10,Recommended,"Apr 30, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_07db6897ef,9,3712
"Note:This review is based on the original Japanese dub not the English dub. This is one of those shows that require no introduction but just in case you do need one. The show centers around the protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and his crew and the adventures that they go on so that they can each accomplish their dreams and goals. It is one of the many few shonen anime that can keep my attention and keep me engaged and excited for the next episode. Story 9/10 The story might seem very simple on the surface, but as you get further into the anime, the show begins to show layers with many themes of friendship, trust, loss, and many different things that drive the show. The story really has many layers that can't necessarily be explained by words,so i'll leave judgment of story up to the viewers, but in my opinion the story isn't the only thing that makes this show amazing. Characters 10/10 I believe that One Piece has an amazing diverse cast of characters with most if not all characters being able to be well developed in the amount of time that they get. All the characters are memorable, lovable, and outright very well developed. Enough so that they make me actually care for each character that is introduced. The characters truly make up the world and really push the enjoyment factor so high I wish I could rate it higher. Art 7/10 Due to this being a weekly shonen show with many many episodes the animation is bound to have its ups and downs, but when the animations shines it really shines and when it doesn't, it shows. Sound 9/10 The music and voice acting of this show is amazing. I can't tell you how many times I will hum one of the many opening songs or instrumental pieces while I'm outside. There are some times when I don't really like some of the voices of some characters but that is just from my own personal opinion. Overall 10/10 There are some flaws that I have not mentioned but I believe that this show overshadows all those flaws with it's amazing world, fantastic cast of characters, and amazing storytelling. I would recommend One Piece to anyone. One Piece really is in my opinion a truly amazing anime.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_89b20f5ed2,9,2139
"One Piece delivers an infectious joy and energy during its standout episodes, but the pacing often stumbles into repetitive lulls that strain the viewing experience. The humor, while well-intentioned, doesn't always land consistently, leading to stretches of filler that test your patience. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, with each highly anticipated episode reigniting the hype, only for the bad stuff that comes with it to resurface, to extend the wait for more substantial plot progression. The slower episodes feel like treading water, lacking of anything meaningful really most of the time, despite the occasional entertaining moment, i sometimes had to fast forward through some episode, which i had never done yet, forcing myself to continue as the praise and recommendation it is getting. When One Piece hits its stride with fast-paced action, tight scripting, and impressive animation, it's truly a sight to behold, especially when you’re filling invested at this point it’s allons-y like a casino, and we’re all gamblers waiting to see our investissement return and sometimes lie to our self because we can’t face the fact that we had to watch an enormous amount of bad episodes. When it’s good the energy and excitement are palpable, reaffirming the series' status as a timeless classic. The music, and voice acting really does match what the animation trying to bring making a nice combination, even tho a bit childish sometimes, as for the trio (voice,animation,music). Ultimately, One Piece remains a remarkable achievement in the realm of manga, with unforgettable high points that showcase its enduring appeal. But as for the anime it’s just tough to endure, especially since the show doesn’t really have significant mindboggling moment as luffy and all the crew end up unscathed almost every time, and their level up with no real training sometime that could be more shown in the more boring/lackluster episodes makes it a little easy sometimes when they/he gets strong all of a sudden. Nevertheless, the uneven distribution of quality content may leave some longing for more consistently engaging storytelling ,and for the more focussed ones of y’all, it will payout when great episodes comes out. I’m putting a stop to my journey as I’m definitely feeling like I only will end up more and more disliking the show maybe I’ll take it back later like a good old love/hate toxic relationship. In the end respect other’s reviews, everyone have a different view and palate for everything in this world. And you’re feeling is not universal.. for my part the note is really quite low because of the disgust I have for it right now but I’ll update ofc if I change my mind.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 28, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c7e9923730,9,2685
"Now before fanboys get mad at me I'm just goint to say I love One Piece very much, it's one of my favorite manga of all time. It's thorough, colorful and exciting. But I have a LOT of problems with the anime. Story: The story is good, it's serviceable. Luffy goes out on an adventure to become king of the pirates. A very generic concept but once he assembles his crew (Zoro, Sanji, Chopper, Nami and Usopp specifically) things get a lot more exciting. The villains (ESPECIALLY CROCODILE) stand out a lot because of how different they are from each other. There's a lot of good guys in the marines and there's a lot of good pirates on the sea so it creates this gray area which is extremely interesting. Now for my problem with the anime, the pacing is absolute DOGSHIT and I really don't think there's an excuse for it at this point. Look at Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, it is another really long manga but it's gotten through 3 LONG story arcs without going over 100 episodes. One Piece takes its sweet time going through things and it really hurts the experience. I'm only on episode 45 of the anime because I can't handle sitting down and watching the 700 something episodes while I'm caught up with the manga Art: The style faithfully adapts Oda's work its based off of. Although at times it looks pretty awful and uncanny valley (ESPECIALLY NAMI'S FACE JESUS CHRIST SHE LOOKS SCARY AT TIMES.) I understand looking ugly some frames, it comes with animation but lord it's really bad sometimes. Like I said, the anime's style faithfully represents Oda's original work BUT it's still pretty ugly at times and I'm not talking about the random frames, I'm talking about just looking at the anime. Oda's artwork didn't translate super well into anime form. Sound: The voice actors in both the japanese version but everybody knows how shit the 4kids dub is at this point. I don't even have to talk about it. Just listen to the pirate rap and you'll understand. The voice actors in that version are so shit they take away the emotional power of some very sad scenes its that bad. Character: This is the part where the anime succeeds with flying colors (mainly because it's pretty difficult to fuck up characters from the source material but you get me.) The strawhat gang especially are well done compared to the big 3's main character and their ""crews."" The strawhats all have aspirations outside of Luffy's big dream, they all feel individual instead of desperately clinging to the mc's goal. My personal favorite strawhat is Zoro, he's been there since day 1 and he's extremely loyal. Unlike other anime characters, he doesn't forget his dream when he goes with Luffy and he continues to train. The villains are also pretty amazing, Crocodile is a cruel and sadistic pirate who watched four people who wanted to fight him die slowly while he laughed, Akainu is a bastard (One piece fans will understand why he is, spoilers) and Blackbeard is cowardly scum you DESPERATELY want to watch lose Enjoyment: IT'S ONE PIECE! If you're a fan of the manga you're gonna enjoy the anime, it's a faithful adaptation that doesn't leave anything out as far as I've seen. It's great seeing some of my favorite pirates in motion even though the animation leaves a little bit to be desired. I really highly recommend this if you're too lazy to read the manga and you still want to experience One Piece. It's shonen action at it's finest. I hope you enjoy the story as much as I am.",8,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1a927e51ee,9,3461
"After seeing the scores I have given this anime, many people might be confused by my overall score. Don't get me wrong, One Piece is my favorite manga, hands down. The story is wonderful, the characters are great, the art style is unique and colorful. However, One Piece is a long running shounen manga that is no where near being finished. Usually with these types of series, the anime will add in long filler arcs to allow the manga to put out more material for the main story. Naruto and Bleach are notorious for this and even Fairy Tail had to resort to doing this as well. During its early years, One Piece did this as well, but currently it has resorted to animating one chapter per episode. And this leads to an enormous amount of filler in each episode. Fights are drawn out. Running places takes five episodes. An entire conversation or death scene can take up a full episode. After a while, this sort of thing gets very frustrating, and I have had to put the anime on hold twice now. Another issue I have with this show is the animation and this also ties in with the filler problem. The animation is very sloppy and its pretty bad when you're watching an episode and notice at least three separate occasions where the same animation is used (I'm pointing fingers at you, Coliseum animation!). The animation will also pan over crowds or go between different characters for 15-30 seconds to fill time, and it could be that no one is actually speaking at all during this. Honestly, if you're really interested in getting into One Piece, I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime. You'll only get frustrated with the filler and animation. EDIT: As mentioned above, I have dropped this series twice: once in Puck Hazard and once in Dressrosa. I am currently four episodes into the Mink/Zou arc and am probably three episodes away from finally rage quitting this horribly animated adaption of my favorite manga. The filler is unbelievable and the animation is terrible. DO NOT watch this anime past the Timeskip if you are interested in One Piece.

"The story of One Piece is a long and enjoyable experience. It makes you care for the characters and their bonds; you become emotionally invested in their success. However, the anime is a disappointment to say the least. The length of scenes are stretched to a ridiculous degree. Every episode covers one chapter, but that includes an intro song, an outro song, and a long unnecessary recap. If you catch up you will constantly be waiting a week just for the characters to almost do something. and as the series gets farther into the story the animation gets worse. If you are interested in this series; read the manga.

The art style, yes a big issue for allot of people who considerd this anime and didnt watch it because of the art style....but if you remember it well this is a review about the 10 GOOD things so that means the art style isnt a bad thing. actually its refreshing and suprisingly good. It shouldnt be anything difrent , if it would have it would be one piece as we know it....maybe its difficult to get into it because it isnt high end drawings but still it makes it unique and thats why its still good when its bad. 9. Pirates....it isnt my fav subject around on this world actually beside pirates of the carab i never liked things about pirates....whats with the old ships, the crappy heads and the drinking all the time anyway? but this made the pirate genre so difrent so new that after watching this serie you will love them....maybe because its not really traditional pirates....its more like a comination between fantasy and the good old pirate work....and still you will see allot of big characters in the pirate world that you will remember of from stories like disney. 8. the world....yes this is something that comes right after the subject pirates....because its unique in its own way and still something that shouldnt have been used to begin with...a whole world made out of water and island.....you would think it would be boring because even after a few of episodes from pokemon when they where traveling around islands it got boring....but this wont.....you will notice sometimes they stick around on an island for tons of eps and still you wont be bored....the world has allot of favriations but but still not that much that you will get lost....great design of the world ^^ 7. villain....yes, they are awesome, they are scary....but not too scary, they are funny but not that much that you wont take them sirious anymore and even if you take them sirious and you are scared of them they still will make you laugh at some point.....sometimes they are all fun sometimes they are all sirous but most of the time they are an combination of both and they have awesome attacks, unique abilities and last but not least some weird way of always returning and never actually die.....its up too you if thats a good or bad thing. 6. npc's....yes i shouldnt call them no playable caracters but you feel for the crew of the luffys ship but you never actually feel compasion about the people surounding them....only a few times but that s because they are longer in the storie then a few eps....anyway, the people who help the strawhead crew are great they give that little bit of extra to make the story going on even when it gots boring..... 5. the ship.....i wont go on about this for too much but at some point you will even care about the ship where our heroes sail on.... 4. the music....yes its a big deal, maybe not from the start but the anime has about over 400 episodes now and still allot of the sounds are still being used from episode 1.....this makes it special because after about 100 eps you will remember them you will sing them in your head and you will c rave for the ost to have....even the opening and ending songs are great, various, and original.... 3. humor....yes, comedy is a big deal in this anime....even at times you dont expect it its there and you want it to be there....be affraid, because your tummy will hurt when you watch a few eps in a row ^^ 2. the crew....the strawhead crew is one of those things that makes this show go how it goes.....they have allot of histroy and backgrounds, they are unique and original designd and they have their own flaws but also their own powers....they are difrent then all the other caracters in this anime and thats why its a good choice they are almost in every episode ^^ 1. the story.....yes this is I think the best thing about this anime.....the story, not only will you not expect an anime drawn this simple have a very deep story at some points, also you wont expect to actually tear and cry because of it....you want to watch all those 400+ eps because you WANT to know how it goes further.....you will be on a story rush 24/7....even the fillers are great, funny and deep enough to watch them....and to be honest i think if a story is great about an anime its already worth watching even all the other things dont work for you.... Thats why i recomend dont hold back because of the art style or the weird sence of humor sometimes and keep watching .....after 30/50 eps you will be hooked and smack yourself on the head blaiming yourself you didnt watch it to begin with ^^",9,Recommended,"Jun 27, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_52cd2920ba,10,4937
"One Piece for me is probably the greatest piece of work I've ever seen come from an anime creator. The incredible thing has nothing to do with the art or the special effects, but rather the powerful emotion drawn from within many of the scenes incited by the characters. The emotional scenes draw out the full potential and strength of the main characters which makes them look really (how should i say it ""nutz"" or ""kickass""). If that isn't enough, its flawless storyline brings out something more and more and as the story goes on and on and every little event comes into detail which all connects together for the preparation of an incredible event yet to come.

Having dropped it a few times in the past because I found the Alabasta/Arabasta arc a drag, this time I focused on the manga, watching some scenes that I would like to see animated. I found myself really engrossed into the story, so far having completed up until the end of Dressrosa, I think that ever since the beginning of Skypiea saga up until here it has been going on an upward spiral and the payoff is so good!

"Skipping the fillers, pre timeskip it's goated. After timeskip slows down to a crawl and is only watchable via either edited versions or waiting 1-2 years to then binge it if you caught up. This is because of a double whammy effect of both the studio dragging since it caught up and because Oda has changed how he structures his manga post timeskip to include tons of things happening at the same time/split up scenes. 100% recommend watching until timeskip and skipping fillers.

"'One Piece' is an enduring and iconic anime series that has left an indelible mark on the world of anime and manga. Boasting a vast and intricate narrative, the series introduces viewers to the captivating adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his eclectic crew of pirates as they navigate the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece. The anime, while occasionally criticized for its slow pacing, delivers a compelling storyline filled with rich character development, emotional depth, and a myriad of imaginative worlds. The diverse range of characters, each with their unique abilities and backstories, adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, making it a truly immersive experience. The art style, though distinct and not as polished as some more recent series, carries a charm that has endeared 'One Piece' to fans worldwide. The animation quality may not always match the standards of newer, seasonal anime, but it remains consistent throughout the series, considering its long and continuous run. It's important to acknowledge that 'One Piece' is not a seasonal anime, and its longevity requires a different viewing perspective. Comparisons to newer, shorter series should be tempered by the understanding of the unique challenges faced by a show that has been ongoing for such an extended period. In conclusion, 'One Piece' deserves commendation for its compelling narrative, diverse characters, and the cultural impact it has had over the years. Despite its imperfections, it stands as a testament to the power of long-form storytelling in the anime medium. I would rate 'One Piece' a solid 9/10 for its enduring legacy and the sheer joy it has brought to fans globally.",9,Recommended,"Feb 1, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7827b0446e,10,1696
"This anime is brilliant. Has a mix of tragedy and comedy and you can get attached to characters and feel as if you are on the same journey. This anime has a lot of depth to it, a lot more than it seems. This would be a 10/10 if the pacing was a little better but the manga fixes that problem which is why the manga is a 10/10. One piece is miles ahead of Naruto in terms of everything and is by far the best in the big 3. If you disagree then just check the facts.

The development of the world is excellent, the plot is interesting and complex, the mysteries are well placed and really make you want to watch more to find out the answers. Oda (the author) doses the scenes of comedy, drama and tension very well throughout the anime, and the characters are well built and developed. The animation is good, nothing out of this world, as the Brazilian saying goes: It's rice and beans. There are episodes where the animation is excellent and others where it's a real mess.

"I decided to watch One Piece when a filler-arc started in Boruto and it looked as if it would not be ending anytime soon. I needed something else to watch and a friend recommended “One Piece”.I thought why not and decided to give it a try. A few minutes in to the first episode, I was a bit put off by the weird art style and this very childish atmosphere, but since I had nothing else to watch, I kept at it.. Till About episode 130 I saw the Protagonist Luffy go on Adventures on his ship, gathering more crew-mates and Basically having fun trying to right the wrongs in his world. A crazy world filled “Devil fruits” and islands in the sky. Pretty interesting stuff, But i didnt think it was anything to be crazy about. Then “Water-7” and “War Summit” happened. To me these two story arcs are some of the best Ever among all the anime i have seen. The pace, story, and characterization were all perfect and Whats more, it widened the world of one piece and I realized that there were a Lot more mysteries waiting to be revealed. I had Officially become a fan of One Piece. No doubt the best anime of all time. From the starting of episode 1 till now this anime has never let my hopes down. I have known many people saying they have not watched one piece because of its length but I guarantee this that this anime is worth that many episodes. The best thing about this anime is every arc is better than the last one. More Than 987 episodes, a lot of laughs and some tears later, I Feel that finally something worthwhile came out of a boruto filler arc.

"My personal opinion is simple: I really like it, but the pacing is a hurdle. What fueled me to start the series is that I didn't want to get spoiled. It has its moments, but you have to GRIND through HOURS of flashbacks. There aren't even that many filler episodes, so you just have to sit through and endure, picking pieces of information, plot and character development throughout the whole series until you arrive at the key moments of each arc, the payout after all the buildup. This series is only recommended for anyone who feels like enduring the challenge of sitting through it. If you're into reading manga, I highly recommend reading it. The story, characters and the world are well written and the pacing is good, I'd say it only depends on your reading speed. I'm editing this review in the future once I'm caught up with the damned thing and give it a proper rating score, because it's a piece of art in development so it's not fair to give it a rating this early into the show (800 eps in lol). One of the reasons why I'm not making a full review now is its animation. It displays the history of the evolution of analogue TV and hand-drawn animation, to the current digital broadcasting and computer-generated animation. And I know that it's evolving even further, with the latest arcs showing off some gorgeous scenes that showcase masterful animation techniques. These are details that I want to put into consideration for my full review. That being said, I'm never changing my ""Mixed feelings"" recommendation because; I'll say it again: the pacing is AWFUL. This series isn't something that can simply be recommended to anyone.

"Alright, being my favourite anime/manga, I feel a need to review this. One Piece starts off on a pretty average note. Nothing spectacular. Being a very old show (started in 1997), the art is quite shitty at first. To drop the show because of this reason alone is a bad mistake. Think of it more like a fine wine that ages exceedingly well over time. Moving on, ""it looks too childish"". I've heard that a lot from people who haven't watched it, and I'm sure I even thought it myself at one point. Sadly, Oda's unique art style does look very stylized and might be difficult to get used to. Give it a few episodes however and you will realized that the art lends itself to the plot perfectly. The designs are unique and the settings are creative. Without a doubt, you will love it in no time. It's quite fair to mention that Oda is a huge fan of exposition and meticulous planning. Love it or hate it, it only serves to add that extra layer of depth to the story. All his story arcs have a lasting impact and he never forgets about the characters he introduces. The unbelievable lack of any real plot holes in such a long running series demonstrates his attention to detail and love of his craft. Sure, many of you will scoff when you hear One Piece is a masterpiece. Really thou, I scoff at that too. Oda makes mistakes like any author and the plot moves quite slow at some points (a disease mostly exclusive to the anime). However, what One Piece excels at is its sheer amount of entertainment. So what if it's not Shakespeare. It will definitely bring you more fun than Hamlet ever would. Overall, One Piece has grown on me like no story ever has. Throw away your doubts and give it try. Before you know it, you'll only be wanting more. ---Common misconceptions and preposed solutions--- -Think you're too mature for ""shounen shit""? Get over yourself. -Not a fan of long ass anime?

"One Piece is a super long anime about pirates. The aspect of pirates is still there as the show progresses but fades into the background. Aside from that I feel One Piece is one of the greatest anime's of all time. The shows as such amazing characters. The debates of who is the best characters can get a room of watchers all fired up. The main characters have so many iconic character traits to make the stand out. Even supporting character can get your emotions flowing. One Piece is an emotional roller coaster. It can take you from happy to angry the to balling your eyes out in just a few episodes. things will get fore shadowed hundreds of episodes early. the world created in One Piece has so much lore, wonders and mysteries from sky islands to fish men.

"You stumbled across this page, because you wondered what is One Piece, but probably, your most important question, that has been poking your mind since some time is: Should I watch it? Now the basic facts. There are currently 688 episodes aired, and that's probably bit more than half of the planned material Eiichiro Oda (the manga creator) has . To catch up to the current arc you would need to sacrifice around 40 average anime series (or you could do just a lot of different staff in your life, right?). That's more than ten days of constant watching. So how to measure if it's worth it? How to benchmark it? Before you will read further you need to be totally aware of one thing: the anime is slow, the pacing is awful, more so then ever in the newest arcs. It's like they are trying to squeeze all the money they can from the audience (the Toei animation studio), the same thing that Naruto is currently doing. Also, the anime in my opinion, has a pretty much a love/hate relationship going on, and to measure it for yourself, you would need to consider watching around 100-110 episodes. Now if compared to 700 or 1000 it's or even more it's not that bad... The reason for that, is that the real action begins with the Alabasta Saga (saga consists of few arcs), that starts at episode 62. If the Alabasta Saga won't get your full attention, you will feel forced to stare at the screen etc., dislike this and that, then you should consider dropping One Piece for your own safety. If, on the other hand, you will find yourself immersed in the anime, waiting impatiently before you can watch the next episode, welcome on the love train. Also consider this. One thing is to watch anime that has the standard 12-24 episodes (or just a bunch of seasons), another thing is to watch anime that has hundreds of episodes. Obviously, to keep the quality level constant in such big series (or manga series for the fact) is just impossible. If you won't like Alabasta, it will be hard to keep on watching later. Now there are better arcs then Alabasta, but do you want to watch another 100 episodes just to get to them? All in all, the best way, from the neutral point of view would be just to write down the aspects that create One Piece, make it what it is, and depend on how you respond to them, watch or just leave, it's just as simple as that, having of course in mind what I wrote above: • Humor with mix of goofing around • Slow, bad pacing at times • Long Battles - full shounen style • Good Story that connects all the Sagas • Great Characters with their own personal story (especially the crew) • Many black and white characters, you are either good or bad • Simple, meaningful emotions, that even the youngest audience will understand (especially friendship) • Repetitive at times • Very good voice acting ( I am NOT watching a dubbed version) • Pretty much no death • Just decent music and art even in the newest arcs • Enormous world and enormous amount of characters that you will stumble across your journey • Creativity regarding the laws, history, organizations, countries, buildings (size of some of them is truly astounding) and most obviously all the POWERS the shounen characters get • Predictable at times • Generally, over the top design of many aspects of the manga and anime • Misconception regarding some terms: like pirates, government, marines etc. Know the author of this simple review is a bit of fan of series, but I tried to stay as objective as possible. So the high score for me is obvious. Thanks for reading.",9,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c07b73edac,10,3537
One piece is a great shounen series. Some people might wonder why I put the score so low. We are talking about the anime here thats why. At first the animation was fine but later on after the new world it became terrible. Pacing is too slow and the animators are lazy. I would have given early one piece anime a 6 or a 7 but overall its not that good. I still recommend the anime because at times some scenes are done better than in the manga and the story of one piece is still interesting. just don't expect something top quality,5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 14, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_36b1c06120,10,531
"Such a horrible fate One piece has to find himself being produced by Toei Animation studios. There is no doubt that one piece is awesome if we talk about the story. The universe is attracting, characters are lovable and it follows a certain logic that fit perfectly the shounen manga world, from this point of view you will definitly have a hard time finding a manga with such big and coherant world and at the same time light-hearted. So story 8/10. [IF YOU DIDN'T WATCH ONE PIECE PASS ONTO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH BECAUSE IT HINT ABOUT THE STORY] The only problem that i could spot in the story is the recent developpement of Sanji,Usopp and Brook. The author has quite ignored sanji and brook, and make usopp a good for nothing, succeeding in enormous proportions because of his luck and not his will to become a great pirate. And that sacrifice of the character only for some gags that are not funny is in my point of view very absurd. If we were 5 Years in the past and you were telling me Usopp's storyline from the dressrosa Arc, i'm not sure if i would want to talk with you again... For the character developpement, i'm sadened that the author of the pillar of the shounen world (so children story) actually has the systematic tendency to over-sexualise the body of the women in his story. The binary vision of the pretty women with big boobs and a perfect waist in the opposite of the ugly women is really disturbing and can opress the lector. Because of these two point i gave 6/10 note for Characters. Soundtrack is awesome and voice characters too so : 8/10. When in the vast majority of anime adaptations the anime make the story even more interesting and pretty. One piece is the exact inverse case. From static plans being abused to bad drawings, bad and awfully long animations and a pacing utterly slow, the dynamics of fights is impacted negatively. It's because the studio has make the awfull choice to animate one chapter per episode, have you seen in an anime a character yelling 2 times in the same scene his attack's name, then you haven't seen one piece anime. Some scene are very far from being honest with the manga. So i put 1/10 for the Art. Overall, don't lose your time watching one piece anime, buy the books you'll definitly enjoy better the story. I put 1/10 Overall because i think 8/10 for this anime is defintely too much, i would put 4/10, but my opinion is that this anime does not represent the manga correctly. It's not for nothing that a project named ""One pace"" (Removing all sort of bad scene) exist for this series.",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 12, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7321d4cf6a,10,2555
"Personally I have tried 4 times to get into this series (reading and watching). Each time something different has been a turn off for me but I know there are a lot of people on the other side of the fence. So I guess give it a try. My big 3 reasons for not liking this series 1.) I am not gonna rag on it to much but like some of the other comments mention the art style is not for everyone, I can't deal with it for very long myself. 2.) The characters. This is somewhat of a nitpick and I have heard now since they are on episode like 800+ and some crazy amount of manga chapters some of this has been remedied but outside of Luffy,Zoro,Nami, and Sanji the other characters for the main cast are flat out annoying. 3.) The length. I understand that for some people this doesn't bother them cause they have been reading since day 1. I don't have 3 lifetimes to spend trying to get caught up with this. If you are someone who has limited time due to life this is not for you if you want to have any idea what is currently going on. While I am not trying to give much away but with all the strange adventures that this series covers I was informed after so many episodes they made it to the grand line where they were trying to go for so long just to sail right back away from it?

"Man.. every week I await for the arrival of a new episode , there was not a single letdown, the episodes rarely had repetition of previous chapters and is always filled with new content Story 8/10 Oda is a brilliant author, many folks would just believe one piece is a pirate killing and blundering things. One piece is a story of a young boy whom aspired to be a pirate, his immature, reckless and stubborn often give author no choice but to admire his actions. The plot twists and the slow foreshadowing of unrevealed characters such as the Yonko, shichibukai and navy admirals always kept readers in suspense. However the episode may be dragged unnecessarily, creating a turnoff Art 8/10 The animation is great, it depicts the characters flawlessly. Toei animation also paid attention to even the smallest details, which readers would spot and would propose various theories in their mind. However there were moments where the animators fail to design the character fully, giving them a somewhat distorted face, thus a 8/10 Sound 8/10 SHINING RUNNING FOREVER and the battle music is sick.

"I think the question as to whether you love or hate One Piece has already been answered for most people, myself included. So in this review I don't really want to focus on One Piece as a whole, but rather the half of One Piece that I like to call ""Toei Timeskip."" Whether you love or hate One Piece, it's really hard to deny that its current state is a fucking travesty right now. Damn I'm pretty sure I'd even give pre-Toei timeskip an 8 if I could, but I can't because everything afterward goes down the drain. I was tolerating it for awhile, but they really went full Toei on the Dressrosa arc so my patience has run thin on this anime. The most glaring issue to me is the pacing. Regardless of whether or not you care for the quality of the show, I'm sure you still want to at least watch some damn anime at the end of the day. Yet you have to go through roughly 5 minutes of the Toei logo, long ass theme song, and the narrator recapping the last episode. Then when you get to the actual show, it's just another 4 minutes of the same shit you saw last episode until it finally gets to the actual content in One Piece. And even then, the actual content might just be a flashback episode or a bunch of unnecessarily drawn out talking/running scenes. I can't tell if this was a ploy from Toei so they wouldn't catch up to the manga as fast or if it was just a way to fill up the 22 minute segment but either way it's infuriating as hell. I just want to watch some goddamn anime, not ""One Piece: Recap Central."" Another issue is the animation. I have no idea how it got this way. I'm not gonna speculate on whether or not it's because of Toei's big work load on other anime or if they stopped caring, but either way it looks awful. There's so many reused stiff animations that look like super floaty, almost as if the characters all have a devil fruit that lets them fly. It's clear that Toei can do better as their opening themes and movies have good/great animation (second gear in the movies looks orgasmic), but for some reason we are stuck with this animation for now and it looks like it isn't getting any better. To top the animation off, the cheap sound effects make it even more unbelievable. So many sounds are reused that you'll notice it even if you aren't trying to listen for it. Most sounds have this weird static effect attached to it for some reason even if the attack does not call for it. It takes all the impact out of the attacks, the only thing that gives the attacks any impact at all is the VAs which arguably is the only thing carrying One Piece right now. It's a shame that One Piece is in this state cause it's one of the Shounens I have the most passion about. In its current state it is just a solid 4. I'd recommend reading the manga if you care about seeing the story without any of the bullshit that Toei puts in between.

I'm currently 1000 episodes in, watching the Wano arc. So I can for sure say I'm allowed my opinion, and I realise many people won't like it, because this is one of the most beloved animes ever made. I will say, though, this COULD have been one of my all time favourite animes, and I'm going to tell you why it isn't. Firstly I want to talk about the positives. Absolutely awesome world building, my favourite parts of One Piece are usually when they're about to go to a new island, and we're going to discover a new culture, and have some sort of adventure with some new people, in which one of them may join the crew. Two, I love some of the characters they've given us, there are some brilliant characters who I really enjoy watching, and I'll give a rundown of my thoughts on characters after my third point. My third point is that they have some great comedy between the characters, and this especially stands out when they're travelling around before they reach their destination. The sound is generally also good in One Piece, and I'll give a little shout out to the animation. The animation is actually good in my eyes, that goes hand in hand with some good fight scenes, and I mean early One Piece I still liked the animation. It has a really friendly feeling to it, and in more recent episodes it has become super smooth at points. When I seen the arrival of Kaido as a dragon, the animation of his body moving, slinking, and coiling towards them, was well done. So for this part, I'm going to do the main cast, and put them into a tier list, with a little explanation of why they're there. Then after I'll talk broadly about the entire cast. (Once again, this is just my opinion, I know people will disagree) Main Cast; A Tier - Robin, Nami, Chopper B Tier - Zoro, Usopp C Tier - Jimbei, Sanji D Tier - Luffy, Franky, Brook So, Nico Robin for me works well because she's nothing like the rest of the crew, there was a running gag for a long time that she was the only one on the crew who didn't partake in their, well, gags. So her joke is that she doesn't do jokes. I also love her humour around just saying really terrifying, or messed up things so nonchalantly. Her mature demeaner is also a nice break from having the others constantly acting like they're 10 years old, only acting with their first instincts without any thought. Nami for me is just an all around cool character, and I'm gonna shock you here, but I've enjoyed her fights, because she actually has to use her brain instead of just ""I'm gonna endure all your punishment and outpunishment you!"". Chopper grew on me, and he's the perfect mascot for the crew, I enjoy his humour and general being. One thing that ties all these three up for me, though, is that they all have great character building, interesting backstories, and I got emotionally attached to all 3 of them because of it. Now, Zoro was A tier for me, for most of the show. I mean, he's a badass with 3 swords, in my opinion he has some of the very best fights in the whole of the show. He went down, because he doesn't really do anything? Like, he never has an input on what they're planning to do, I don't think we have even seen much of his backstory, and we don't really know too much about him as a person at this point. He had an awesome moment at the end of Thriller Bark, but honestly, what does he even add to the crew in the last 500 episodes? I know people will say ""he's their best fighter"", well, that's not true, Luffy is, Luffy defeats every bad guy, so he's clearly stronger than him. Usopp grew on me a LOT, I hated him for so long, but I did gradually come around. He would be A tier if he had some sort of character development besides changing his clothes? He's still the same cowardly type we met in episode 10, as he is now in episode 1000. Jimbei I'm indifferent to, and Sanji I just purely dislike because his fighting is boring, the amount of screen time we get of it zoomed in on his cigarette as he either lights it up, or just stands there, could probably fill an arc of its own by this point. I also am not a fan of the fact it took them near 850 episodes to give us his backstory. I do like when he says Robin and Nami's names, but other than that he's just a more overbearing Brock from Pokemon. Franky is just boring to me, and I'm not sure of the point in Brook? I liked him in Thriller Bark, but kinda wish they never added him to the crew. After the 5th time of him making the exact same ""I can't believe my eyes, oh well, I don't have any yohoho"" joke, it gets stale. And that's all he has to offer it seems? Luffy. Many people absolutely love this guy, and honestly, I have no idea why. He as a main character is truly boring, and far too much of the show revolves around him. I don't like his fights, stretching is just a boring power, he does the same old ""I like food"" joke that we've seen a thousand times in other anime. He doesn't progress as a character, at all, he is still the exact same person as he was in episode 1. Before fire fist dying, he didn't even have an interesting backstory, all it was is ""he met a pirate called Shanks, and promised to him that he'd become King of the Pirates"". Luffy is one of my biggest problems with One Piece. To compare what I think is an actual truly good front character, with Luffy, let's talk about Naruto. Naruto had crazy amounts of development as a character in that show, and they did it in less episodes, too. He went from being a stroppy, dumb, antisocial, kind of an ass, to being a super outgoing, popular, thoughtful person, who even would think through his fights before just rushing in like he would at the beginning. Luffy doesn't showcase this at all, no matter how many times his crew have almost been killed, he doesn't think, ever, his head is empty, he see's an enemy, and he just rushes in not knowing what their power level is, or their devil fruit ability. Moving onto my favourite characters across the whole anime. Fire Fist Ace, Nico, Chopper, Nami, Aokiji, Fujitora, and Law. This isn't to mention all the other awesome characters they have Doflamingo, Kuma, Crocodile, Eustass Kid, Caesar Clown, Akainu, Kizaru, and here's one from the memory banks, Kuro. I bet I have even missed out a bunch of other cool characters. My problem here is that, with the longest running anime of all time, 1000+ episodes, and some of these awesome characters have BARELY appeared. Are you kidding me? We've seen Shanks far far more in flashbacks than the actual anime, the guy who essentially started off One Piece by inspiring Luffy, and we NEVER see him. Aokiji, holy fuck has there been a better introduction to a character in an anime? Guy is just asleep, chilling. Fucks them up with ease, and then rides his bike across the ocean. But then guess what? We don't see him again for another 200 episodes, and even in that, it wasn't in any meaningful way. After Marineford, again, he's gone until a cameo appearing at the end of Punk Hazard, and we haven't seen him since. What in the fuck is with this writing, instead of using the already build world of great characters, they just throw them in the bin to carry on making newer, less interesting ones like Carrot???? How many characters do they introduce, and then focus on, just for that arc. During Arabasta, we met Vivi, which I thought was not a bad thing, because at this point we only have 5 Straw Hats, let alone a world filled with characters. After Marineford, we have so, many, characters, we do not need to move to new places, and spend 30+ episodes on backstory for some new characters that aren't fresh or interesting. Dressrosa brought in a bunch of them, the king, his daughter, her husband amongst others that I just didn't care about. Overall, my problem with their use of characters is mostly just the lack of them being actually used, and constant focus on newer characters when we already have 50+ we can play around with. The lack of character development isn't huge, but I'd like to see at least one or two changes in some people that isn't just appearance. Why hasn't Luffy learnt to be smarter when wanting to fight someone after he watches his brother die, and he thought his crew all died to Kuma. Why hasn't Usopp gotten a backbone after going through so many wars and fights. Why do the animators think giving Nico and Nami bigger boobs, and more cleavage, is character development? Also, Fire Fist Ace should have been the main character of One Piece, he had far more charisma, seemed far more intelligent, and actually was interesting to watch in a fight. Now, let's talk about the arcs (I told you this would be a long one). I don't wanna write a novel, so I'll be as concise as possible here and straight up say, that they made, FAR too many episodes for some of these arcs. Arabasta is the first arc that made me wanna quit watching because of how long it was, little did I know, 38 episodes would be a short arc in One Piece by the end. Although I did enjoy Skypiea, I don't know that it could have been a lot better having less than 42 episodes. Enies Lobby the same with 46 episodes. 51 for Fishman Island, 46 for Punk Hazard, 45 for Thriller Bark. And now here comes the killer, 118 episodes for Dressrosa. This arc here is the one that absolutely burned me out watching this show. Really, 118 episodes? My god, I'm getting Vietnam flashbacks thinking about this arc right now. 95 for whole cake island. And now we're currently 114 episodes deep into Wano Country. I realise people will say, ""but Seth, the more episodes, the more we can get backstory for characters, and build an emotional connection to them"", but do we really need that many? I'm gonna list off a few anime here which absolutely had people invested in the characters and what happened to them, and they did it in less episodes that all those arcs I just mentioned in the last paragraph. Steins:Gate - 24 Death Note - 37 Cowboy Bebop - 26 Neon Genesis Evangelion - 26 Heck, to make my point, just look at all the movies that build a world, build characters, give backstories and manage to have it all play out with people being emotionally invested in only 2 hours, which is let's say 4-5 episodes worth. Now, I'm not saying all animes should be shorter because of this, I'm merely pointing out One Piece has had far, far more than enough time to have every single character fleshed out by now, and we could have progressed the story a lot more than we currently have. Naruto is one of the greatest animes imo, although it went on a little longer than I thought it should, and I got a bit bored of it towards the end, at least in those 766 episodes we know so much about every character in that show. We know the entire history of the the world in Naruto, we seen every person have a fight with every other top character, we have seen some characters completely change through their development on the show, we seen all of it play out and finish in 766 episodes. By the 1000th episode on One Piece, we still don't know anything about the 100 year period in their history, we only JUST learnt about Gol D Roger, we still don't know too much about characters past like Zoro who have been in since the beginning of the show. We still don't know what the One Piece even is, we have 0 idea on how strong Shanks is, we have rarely seen all the top characters fight with one another, and I'm just not sure what we've been watching in replacement of all of that? New shittier characters than we already have? Focusing a tonne on characters that will be gone when the arc finishes and they leave the island? Spending half of the episodes doing flashbacks of previous episodes? (Naruto did this a lot as well). I will say, I enjoyed Thriller Bark even though that was 45 episodes long, but I felt that more of this was valuable, because the new character that we were introduced to, and had a bit of focus on for a few eps was Brook, who actually ended up joining the Straw Hats. It felt like this arc actually had a good focus on our already established crew, and we didn't get half of the arc showing us flashbacks of a character that we don't care about. Longer arcs can be good, but in One Piece they oftenly aren't imo, because they don't use the already built characters in the world that we care about, and they waste a tonne of time on pointless shit, stretching out the arcs needlessly. So, lastly, I'll do a quick run of my favourite arcs from first to last. Marineford - Most people's favourite, and it's obvious why. We had a bunch of big boys fighting it out, and I loved the dynamic of Garp being between his career/upholding what he thought was justice, and his family. Most importantly, this was only 33 episodes long. Only one downside was that only Luffy from the Straw Hats was in this arc, none of the others made it there, so we never got to see them in action versus the Navy's strongest. Still, overall a great arc though. Also, I wish they made Ace die on the podium, rather than make him look dumb as fuck by basically escaping, but then going back to be killed just because Akainu said ""ur mom gay"". Really did my boy dirty, and made Ace look stupid at the end there. Sabaody Archipelago - Introduced so many good characters, an arc that turned out huge for the story of One Piece, introducing the worst generation, Kuma sending everyone away, leading to a two year time skip, and we seen a lot of moving pieces within' the story in only 21 episodes. Maybe the biggest shock was that we seen the Straw Hats get dismantled so easily by Kuma, after watching them win almost all of their fights up until this point. It was the first time we seen the usual happy-go-lucky Luffy in a state of despair. Water 7 - One of the best countries they visit, unique, really cool theme, and nice bit of mystery with a fun twist in there. Really good setup for Enies Lobby, and most of the episodes were centred around Usopp, Nico, and Franky, three characters who are actually in the Straw Hats. Usopp vs Luffy was hard to watch, but a part of me wanted Usopp to get a reality check, and that he did. Him watching them sail away from him actually had me feeling for him, even despite Usopp's many flaws. Arlong Park - The arc that changed the vibe of the show from 'tehehe', to 'oh fuck'. This was one of the first credible threats to the Straw Hats, and I felt Nami's story, as well as her character, were told really well here. I sympathised with her immediately, and it made you want to see Arlong get his ass kicked. 14 episodes and it's still pretty memorable even now, nearly 1000 episodes later. Enies Lobby - Good arc, what might be the most heart wrenching moment of the show when Nico screams ""I WANT TO LIVE!"". Absolutely beautiful, and I loved that. I found most of the episodes that focused on the people moving through the city quite boring, but when they finally catch upto Nico and CP9, everything from there is great. People might ask me why it's not ranked higher, and that's because I felt Water 7 was enough build up, and then the train ride there. When we arrive, we still have to wait another 10 episodes for them to get through the city, at this point I'm blueballed. I realise people may say it's only 10 episodes! But that's over 3 hours of waiting for it. I'm being picky, I know, but that's just how I felt watching it, extremely bored until they stand on top of the courthouse, and what a moment that was. Thriller Bark - I know a lot of people don't like this arc, but I enjoyed it quite a lot, and it ended with one of the most memorable moments in the entire show. (Zoro-Kuma) It stands out because of the slight gothic-horror theme it sets. Robin rejecting Franky's robot transformation was also hilarious. It was good to see them all fight together as a team here. Little Garden - Very short and sweet, they only needed 8 episodes to tell us an interesting story of these two giants, that would be used further on in the One Piece timeline, and we got to see some fights involving Baroque Works. Skypiea - Best part about this arc was the journey to getting there, not knowing if the sky island even existed, and the mystery around all of it. It does get very slow when they arrive, and outside of Eneru, it was a bit too easy for the Straw Hats to beat everyone. Impel Down - A great prelude to Marineford, and it was really helped with the tension built during this arc. We see some old faces, as well as new ones, overall decent arc for what it was. Buggy actually became a pretty funny character in these episodes. Drum Island - Only 14 episodes long, but we get Chopper introduced, as well as a new snowy country, and Chopper's background is pretty good to watch. Wapol played a good villain, and we luckily didn't get 20 episodes showing us his backstory. Punk Hazard - Again, I know many don't like it, but I actually enjoyed it for the most part, glad to see Law involved as he's one of my favourites, it serves as a decent build up to Dressrosa. Syrup Village - This here is where I started to actually enjoy One Piece, the only thing I can say about it, is that I wish Kuro wasn't beaten so easily, I genuinely thought he was a pretty badass villain, but Luffy makes him look like a chump. Wano Country - Currently slogging through it, again spending an absurd amount of time on the history of this country, and the Akazaya Samurai. The flashbacks of Gol D Roger were great, but not enough added to the main story, or the main characters for the amount of episodes it's gotten so far imo. Zou Arc - Met some of the animes worst characters, the mink are really uninteresting, and annoying at times. The country itself initially was really cool to see, it was awesome to wonder about what happened to it, how it got there, and why it's on the back of an elephant, but that all went to shit through the reveals and characters who took up screen time. Orange Town - Not much to say beyond Buggy can be funny at times Baratie - Honestly can't remember much about this arc, I think I kept falling asleep during it until Zoro is defeated by Mihawk, that had my full attention, but by then the whole arc was almost done. Arabasta - The first arc that made me consider dropping One Piece, just because of how long it was, and how little we were progressing in learning, well, anything. This entire arc was about the civil war in Arabasta, and that story alone wasn't interesting to me. Fish-Man Island - I can barely remember anything about this arc, to be honest Dressrosa - Started off really well, Punk Hazard sold us a picture of what it would be like, and how strong Doflamingo is. We met some interesting characters like Senor Pink. But overall it was far, far too long, and the emphasis was most of the time not on the Straw Hats, or the main story. Really enjoyed seeing Law's history with Doflamingo's brother, and it pisses me off that Luffy beat him, Law should 100% of been the person to defeat Doffy. Fujitora was a really cool addition to the arc, and the show as a whole. But yeah, 118 episodes was really hard to get through, when it could have all been said and done if you took out the pointless shit, in less than 50 episodes. Whole Cake Island - Decent start with them travelling around the small islands and running into Pudding, but got boring very quickly with Germa who are lame as all hell, and then the proceeding hunger pangs rubbish where we had to listen to Big Mom saying ""cake"" about 100 times. Absolutely nothing added to the main story through these 95 episodes. We learned about Sanji's upbringing, and that's all. To try and sum it all up as concisely as I can. The biggest problems for me is firstly Luffy as the main character, he never changes, he always has to be the one to beat the bad guy, so I have to watch his overrated boring fights, and he never really seems to think. Secondly, that they overemphasise on side characters or mini-stories that won't effect the main story, or main characters in any meaningful way. Later on in the anime they need to stop introducing more and more new characters, we have tonnes already that are cool and interesting, use them more. No arcs in my opinion should ever go over 100 episodes long. Naruto managed to wrap up the entire Shinobi Fourth War arc in 53 episodes, which is their longest. One Piece needs to stop taking the piss by having multiple arcs run over 50 episodes. For anyone who's read this entire thing, I hope you enjoyed it, and if you didn't and think most of this was a bunch of shit with a few nuggets of truth, then you truly know my feeling towards One Piece!",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 20, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_27d3a516b6,11,20772
"To tell you my truth all i can say is this is the kind of anime that takes its time to tell you the story, it really wants you to understand whats going on and not miss any detail of whats going on. One of the main characters is luffy he is the kind of person who enjoys almost everything and is laid back but somehow is really serious and if one of his friends get in danger he will risk it all to save them. All the characters get there time to shine too and they all get stronger over the story's time line that is really the best thing of this anime i enjoy. This is my first review so it isn't going to be that long or great but this is truly what i think of this anime ;)",10,Recommended,"Jun 6, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4bb5bdd8dd,11,677
"to start off this review, I can't belive i actullay wasted time watching this garbage to see if it can live up to the praise it gets. well I can definitely say that it really doesnt. i couldve been watcing sao or just any other generic isekai instead of this crap shounen. i might be writing this when im tired but i can easily say that it doesnt affect the review too much. story: the story is god awful. its just jack sparrow if he snorted some eraser bits when he was born and then went on an adventure where he expands his arms or whatever lol. They travel with boat while beating oversized steroid abusers and big boobed women. art: the art is really ugly tbh compared to most anime. The character designs are way too simple unlike in most anime I've watched and they just look stupid. They don't even really look like pirates and it looks like Zoro discovered anime during teen years and bought too many fake katanas. Nami's only good trait is the boobs, but theyre a bit too big too. sound: sound: decent music I guess. the sound effects feel kind of unfitting and dumb if you ask me. characters: boring, just simply boring. Luffy wants to find some stupid one piece, like go find two piece instead. other characters were so boring im not gonna even write about them. enjoyment: almost none tbh. It's best I don't try continuing the show because it feels like it'll just stay the same the entire time.

"Here is my review of One Piece. One Piece are maybe the best shounen series available at the moment since it has almost everything, so it’s a must watch anime. Story One Piece is about a pirate named Monkey D Luffy he is going to the Pirate king and find One Piece the greatest treasure of them all. On his way Luffy are going to gather some pirates some of them are: Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji, But the way to the Grand line is though they must fight against the marine, some mermaids, Shichibukai also known as the seven warlords. Art Since the anime started in 98 the animation was kind of bad, but I got used to it, and the animation get’s a lot better over the years. It’s now released in 720p. Sound I like the voice cast all the main characters has some cool and kawaii voices, if you don’t liked them you will get used to it and like them prolly. Please don’t watch the dubbed version since it sucks. I simply love the BGM in this anime it’s good. The openings are okey, nothing special the same with the endings. Character All the characters in One Piece are loveable since they have a unique personality that you will like and cherish. You will get to know every character well since it will tell you about their past while you watch the series. Enjoyment In the start there is a lot of information about the Grand Line and the treasure One Piece. In episode 30 or something like that the anime is amazing and after that you can’t stop watch it since it so good I liked it very much. Overall One Piece is maybe the most popular anime in the whole world expect of Pokèmon though, so One Piece is fairly good anime. I guess many users here on MAL started to watch One Piece so I will say One Piece is a good starting anime for all new people who have not seen much anime.

"I have been watching this anime and reading manga for over a year. It has only gotten better. Although I enjoy the anime, I recommend folks to read the manga, which is the original work of the writer, and please dont watch the dubbed English version of this animation, they have done a crappy job and the emotions, the feel, its all wrong in dubbed version.

"After years of brushing it off, I decided to finally marathon the show about a month ago, and well, it’s not half bad if I’m being honest. Positives: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a setting as big and explored as the world of One Piece in any other anime before (And I’m guessing this is why it’s so popular too). It’s so imaginative and vibrant, so much effort is put into explaining how the setting works in terms of geography, history, factions, religion, government, lore, etc. Everything in the universe links together and many plot threads are consistently carried over and tied into future story arcs, to the point where I would never believe you if you don’t told me he was making it up as he went. The whole cast of characters all have unique character designs and distinct personalities. The main cast is quite fleshed out; you learn almost every detail about them, and their views and priorities slowly change over the course of the series. Same can be said for most side characters, and to some degree, they receive more character development than the main cast. The soundtrack is great and really matches the tone of the series (My favorite being “Overtaken” and the “Stone Storage Room”) and also compliments the scenes (The scene “Walk to Arlong Park” comes to mind). Negatives: Animation; the quality is just not good. It was decent at the start but gradually got worse as the series went on and really hit rock bottom after the timeskip (It looked like I was watching a slide show). It’s repetitive, some story arcs follow this structure of Go to new island->Residents have a dilemma->Fight & beat villain->Go to new island->Res… Pacing; this is why I will be dropping the series at this point, and will be switching to the manga (Eventually). IT’S SO SLOW. The pacing, just like the animation, was decent at the start but gradually got slower to the point where it felt like almost nothing was happening for 23 minutes. I even had to visit the wiki to find out that some story arcs are actually longer in the anime than the manga, and this is without filler, meaning that they adapt less a chapter per episode, just, no. Overall, it has its faults but it’s a fine shonen (At least until the timeskip where the animation severely declines), and this is what I would ultimately consider to be THE adventure shonen.",7,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0ff13147a3,11,2329
"I despised One Piece years ago, I would flick through channels to see what was on, and see an absolutely unappealing show, that upon the sight & sound I cringe in hate. This would carry with me in my mindset when I started to get into anime, and see as one of the most popular shows being that trash called One Piece (of shit). I didn't think twice about ever watching it, until a little word from a friend saying to watch it & it was apparently good, but I lashed back saying it was terrible. A guy who can stretch, REALLY??? Please. It was until that I had heard that there was a another English dub, and it peaked my interest, as well as seeing screenshots comparing the 4kids version to this new Funimation version, and I saw a bloody, more mature version to the childish crap I saw when I was younger. I was intrigued & intent to view this new take on the show, and after my brother receiving about 8 DVDs of the Funimation version of One Piece, we started on what would I now call my favourite anime so far. The story revolves around the golden age of pirates, which begins after the execution of the legendary pirate named Gold D. Roger (aka Gold Roger), who after conquering the Grand Line - and the only person to do so, is named the King of the Pirates. Moments before his execution, he exclaims that the legendary treasure he attained from his adventure - The One Piece, is out in the Grand Line for anyone to claim, and to venture out and search for it themselves. This sparks the dawn of the golden age of pirates, with thousands of men setting sail to attain the legendary treasure. 22 years later a young man named Monkey D. Luffy mysteriously appears with the goal of becoming the King of the Pirates. Having eaten a devil fruit - a mysterious fruit that causes anyone who eats it to gain a strange & powerful ability, while sacrificing their ability to swim. Luffy is a rubber man, and makes a name for himself in every town he ventures through. Living through this dream he travels town after town, gathering crew members and spurring notoriety. This is truly the definition of an adventure, the scale of the world & the journey they go through, the heartships, the pain, the strength they attain, the character growth, the size of the journey in general, its huge, and with it planning to go on for another 10 years, Im happy to know that there is gunna be plenty of One Piece to go :) Some people see the length of the series being so far 600+ episodes long, and be absolutely daunted and hesitant to watch it. The thing they dont see is that if they watch it, and if they love it, that there is so much there for them to watch & enjoy. This is really a case of the saying that looks can be deceiving. A wacky art style, a boy pirate made of rubber, 600+ episodes long and not ending for another 10 years! But for those who have seen as much as I have (600+ episodes) you can understand why I am so hyped about this anime, and for those who haven't, I hope this can get you to have a little idea and perhaps see it for yourselves and join Luffy & the straw hat pirates on this amazing adventure :) Speaking of the straw hat, it was given to Luffy by a pirate called Shanks, and the thing with Shanks is, along with many of the other characters in this series is that they are so incredibly badass & awesome XD You meet these characters at the very start, and just wait in anticipation to seeing them again after the crazy stuff Luffy & his crew endure, only to see them even more incredibly badass than before, and its such an incredible feeling & experience. The character growth in this is magnificent too, the straw hat even has a deep backstory!! :P Every time you meet another crew member, you see their past, which most of the time is an absolute tear jerker, and gets you attached to that character, and before you know it, your attached to everyone in the crew, and they grow on you. They go through unbelievably absurd obstacles & struggles, face the most powerful foes there is, face death, and manage to prevail if it means defeating the foe, or losing and building up their strength. You are essentially a part of Luffy's crew, and when they go through heartache, you break down along with them, when they prevail, its the best feeling ever. When One Piece eventually hooks you in, and eventually convinces you to becomes one of the crew members, your in for one hell of a journey. And It isn't going to end anytime soon, so you'll have plenty of crazy places to run into, awesome characters to face, and the absolutely ridiculous Luffy causes chaos wherever he may be :P And eventually wait for the day where he will, in fact, become the King of the Pirates. And what a wonderful day that will be :D",10,Recommended,"Aug 20, 2013",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bcd07e665e,11,4732

"Sorry, I can't let the nostalgia blind me. One Piece is an absolute mess and the epitome of shōnen brain rot. I've never seen a series that fails on so many levels. It's just so bad, and not only is it just bad; it's one of the largest media franchises in history. How? One Piece has nothing going for it. The power of friendship and vague idealism are the most anyone will ever derive from its story and characters. I mean, really, there's nothing there. There's absolutely nothing about One Piece that even attempts to be good. Luffy is like Eren Jaeger if you stripped him of character development and motivation, because One Piece actually doesn't know what those words mean. One Piece has a thousand episodes to create something of worth, and it still somehow fails. It's bland even by shōnen standards. One Piece, the basic bitch amongst a crowd of basic bitches. The greatest section of the story is actually Enies Lobby, because it contains about three good episodes. Of course, those three good episodes are the only ones in the entire show, but at least it's something. Well, surely there are at least a few decent characters, right? Wrong. Despite having one of the most unnecessarily large casts in all of fiction, not a single one of them is actually well-written. Despite how much it tries, the dialogue in One Piece is utterly appalling, and devoid of subtlety, humanity, and meaning. I would question Oda's own humanity in turn, but considering he's a fifty-year-old man who has published drawings of sexualized children for two decades and suckles upon the gonads of Nobuhiro Watsuki, I think we can already infer that he's been lacking in it. The villains of One Piece are the most pathetic and sloppily written I've ever seen. Utilizing the tropiest of tropes to fool the dopiest of dopes, One Piece has fluked itself into fictional super-stardom with it's cast of truly memorable villains. Hody Jones, the traumatized fish. Doflamingo, the traumatized flamingo. Big Mom, the traumatized... woman? Well, with how Oda depicts women in general within One Piece, I don't think this pattern is quite surprising. Oda has never seen a woman before, which is why he projects his sexual fetishes onto scantily clad girls whose only character traits consist of offensively large booba and badonkadonk. ""Oh, but the world-building is so good!"" Is it, or does it just cram endless loads of irrelevant fluff into a thousand episodes? The only thing that any of the world-building contributes to—is the same boring and poorly executed theme of 'freedom' that haphazardly and opaquely permeates throughout the entire series. It's not impressive, it's not genius, it sucks, just like everything else. Creating an only somewhat detailed world within 1000+ episodes, one which only has detail for the sake of it, is garbage writing. The animation is awful throughout nearly the entire show. For the first couple hundred episodes... it's just appalling. The art gradually improves until the end of Sabaody, at which point it experiences a steady downward trajectory straight into the pits of hell. Then, after about six hundred more episodes of absolute disgrace, it gets decent for the first time. Wow, how wonderful. Keep in mind, this is purely Oda's fault. Trashy and generic panelling, drawing, and writing will naturally result in trashy and generic cinematography and animation. From an aural standpoint, One Piece is honestly quite strong, and the only thing holding it back is sheer repetition. If it were eight hundred or so episodes shorter, it would have one of the greatest soundtracks of all time. Unfortunately, just like most aspects of the series, this is ruined by sheer longevity. One Piece isn't good. Even if it were only 12 episodes long, it still wouldn't be good. Unfortunately, it overstays its unwelcome to a truly unprecedented degree. One Piece is the worst anime of all time, and I'm serious. Skelter Heaven is less insultingly shit by a wide margin. Fruit of Evolution is better. Yes, even Code Geass and Steins:Gate are better.

"A Timeless Adventure of Dreams and Friendship One Piece is not just an anime; it's an experience that defines the essence of adventure. Eiichiro Oda's magnum opus introduces us to a vibrant world teeming with unique islands, awe-inspiring powers, and a richly diverse cast of characters. At its core lies the journey of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, whose unwavering bonds and individual dreams weave an emotional and thrilling narrative. Story (10/10): The plot is a masterclass in long-term storytelling. Each arc introduces compelling conflicts, deep lore, and memorable characters, all while building toward the ultimate goal of finding the legendary One Piece. Oda's ability to connect past events with current developments keeps the story fresh and engaging. Characters (10/10): The Straw Hat crew is the heart of the series. Every member has a distinct personality, backstory, and goal, making them relatable and lovable. The villains, too, are multifaceted, often challenging our notions of morality. Animation (8/10): While the early episodes may not boast the most polished animation, Toei Animation's efforts evolve significantly over time. Modern arcs deliver stunning visuals, especially during intense battles. Sound (9/10): From its iconic opening themes to the emotional background scores, the music perfectly complements the series' tone. Voice acting is exceptional, bringing each character's personality to life. Enjoyment (10/10): Few series can match the excitement, humor, and emotional depth of One Piece. It balances epic battles with heartfelt moments, leaving a lasting impression with every episode. Overall (10/10): One Piece is a monumental journey that inspires its audience to chase their dreams and cherish the bonds they form along the way. It's more than worth the commitment, offering endless entertainment and life lessons for fans of all ages.",10,Recommended,"Dec 24, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9205dd687b,11,1880
"Started watching this piece of art in 2010, almost 15 years following Oda-sensei, and he never failed to amuse me. I was a teen adult when i started watching/reading and found parts of my life in this story back then. Now at 34 years of age, still i find myself watching/reading it, thinking how real some characters are to me, observing the way i look at them changed as i aged. Though it is not for everyone. I understand people who doesn't like it as I watch it with my husband occasionally and he doesn't like the slow pacing, waiting for the side characters/stories to blend into the main plot etc. This is not a main character, going after his dreams and fighting his way towards his goal type of story. If that is what you are looking for, than this series is not for you. This is about sailing in the vast seas, meeting new people, listening to their stories, eating delicious food, wearing fancy clothes, making friends and enemies in every island, exploring every island with a childish excitement, and finally moving on to next adventure. Main plot is still cooking in the background, we are getting there slowly but the most importantly we are enjoying the ride.

"one piece is one of the well-written shounen IM GONNA MENTION BOTH PROS AND CONS OF THIS ANIME LEMME START WITH THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ANIME i)PLOT(9/10): the story of this anime is very good each character will have unique and well written backstory each arc will have a unique story and each and every arc is written for a reason and the story of each arc will be connected to the story in some way except one arc called long ring long land the main plot is also well and good ii)CHARACTER(8/10) one piece has few of the well written characters. each character has an unique ambition and unique strength and weakness, few character were appeared only for few episodes but they made a huge impact in the main story line. iii)Animation(7/10) at the beginning the anime was fair. but after 500 episodes the animation is pretty good iv)Music(8/10) one piece has some of the best background scores in the anime. few background scores like mother sea, gold and oden is well suited for the emotional moments in one piece music played a major impact in emotional moments in one piece my most favourite background score is to the grand line. whenever it is played in one piece that moment will give me goosebumps NOW COMING TO THE CONS OF THIS ANIME 1)PACING(5/10): Regarding the pacing, At the beginning of the anime the pacing is well and good upto nearly 500 episodes the pacing is well and good but when it comes to punk hazard and dressrosa it has the very slow pacing in the anime. Even whole cake island has a slower pacing but it is better than punk hazard. Even though punk hazard and dressrosa has a good plot i have not enjoyed it as i enjoyed the pre time skip arcs due its slow pacing 2)FIGHTS(6/10): About fights, people says one piece has some of the best fights, yes it has but most of the fight scenes were boring. the main character luffy just recklessly attacks the villians without any plan or strategy which makes the fight less enjoyable fighting techniques of some side characters were unique and good marineford has the best fights in one piece even though the arc is full of fights it is the best arc in one piece so far fights at post time skip arcs are too long the fight between luffy and a villian last for more than 10 episodes where nearly for 8 episodes luffy uses the same moves which is boring and at the last 2 two episodes he finds a new moves to defeat the villian over all except few fights all other fights in the anime were average 3)THE MAJOR CONS OF THE ANIME IS PLOT ARMOR THE main character luffy is saved from different villians by an unexpected miracle which is not reasonable.

"I have strong and weak feelings about One Piece, the beloved anime that has won the hearts of millions. It's a cherished classic that has given people endless hours of entertainment, but it also has certain drawbacks. Let's evaluate this based on the following: Pacing - 5/10 Pacing in One Piece is a hotly debated subject. While some storylines have a perfect combination of action, character growth, and plot development, others can seem excruciatingly slow. Particularly in anime, there is a notable quantity of filler material and protracted combat, which can be annoying for viewers who want to see the plot advance. Animation - 7.5/10 Over the years, One Piece's animation has experienced both highs and lows. The animation quality is obviously inconsistent, despite the fact that the visual style is distinctive and has a certain appeal. While certain episodes and storylines stand out for their amazing action sequences and exquisitely detailed locations, others suffer from glaring animation flaws. Given the epic scope of the plot, the usage of still frames during pivotal times can be frustrating (the animation improves after a few episodes, and the current arc is at its best at this point). Story-telling - 9/10 Unquestionably, the strength of Eiichiro Oda's storytelling is One Piece's crowning achievement. His world-building, deft plotting, and feeling of adventure that he infuses into each episode are simply amazing. The main plot of the story, the hunt for the One Piece treasure, keeps you interested and anxious to explore the next island. A tribute to Oda's brilliance is the richness of the world's lore and the ties between characters. Character Development - 8/10 One Piece features a sizable and varied ensemble of characters, each with their own distinctive traits and goals. Character development is effectively done, especially for the key crew members. It's satisfying to see them change and advance throughout the series. The lack of development for some characters who are not part of the main cast can be felt. Undoubtedly, the anime and manga industries have been forever changed by the success of the series. Its strong points include grandiose world-building, engrossing storytelling, and memorable characters. Fans may find the variable animation quality and occasionally slow pacing annoying. One Piece is still a cherished and renowned series that is still praised for its enduring spirit of adventure in spite of its imperfections. Ultimately, my conflicted sentiments towards this are a result of my passion for the show and want to see it continuously achieve its potential. Although the voyage is worthwhile, there may be a few hiccups along the road.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 28, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ffceab8997,11,2696
"This anime is truly incredible. What does it mean to be able to make a movie even for the side characters of an anime? Its story is full of mysteries. Although the power system is not very good, it is sufficient. I loved the sense of friendship and their more realistic approach. There is a ""hero"" in every anime now, I don't like this and I don't think the hero is something realistic. Even though Luffy is going to do a really good favor in this regard, he gets rewarded and is uncomfortable with being called a hero. There are so many good things in this anime, too many to count them, but the only bad thing is that the animation scene is prolonged. People who want to watch from the original source 400 episodes! I watch it a lot and for no reason, I'm one of them.",8,Recommended,"Jul 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2c6cdd4c21,11,770
"The most popular anime to have ever existed. In a lockdown, with nothing to do, I took on the daunting task of completing the biggest and most popular anime to have ever existed. I wish I didn't. Let's start with the positives: 1) The World Building: Arguably the best pro of this series is how huge this world really is. When you start getting to know the world it already seems huge but then many new elements are introduced that keep making the world bigger and better and they fit perfectly. 2) The Characters: This was my favorite part of this series. Every character, doesn't matter if they were main or side, had great back story, motivations, and conclusions. 3) Adventure: One piece is the definition of adventure. It embodies it like no other anime has or ever will. Now the negatives: 1) Humor: In my opinion this was pathetic. Childish humor that never made me laugh. The humor was always the same: Luffy being an air-head; Sanji falling for a girl even if he has to fight her and then refusing to fight her cause chivalry; Usoop being a cry-baby. 2) The Non-existent motive to move forward: One piece is forgotten. I genuinely think the crew if stupid enough to have forgotten their reason for setting out on this journey: One Piece (Even though every character has their own agenda too, the main agenda that the viewer cares about is still One Piece). Just saying ""future pirate king"" isn't going to make Luffy the pirate king. 3) Repetitive Story: You Go to an island - Island being a paradise - turns out it is not - help the people - fight the mini-boss at the end - lose - get a power-up - win and have a party - go to the next island. 4) Goofing off: Luffy or Zoro or Sanji have to get stuck somewhere (the only 3 useful people in a fight) cause of an insultingly stupid reason like having a hunting competition, sleeping, going shopping getting stuck in a building or running in the wrong direction just to get rescued by Nami, getting punched in the head and yelled at, then saving the day. 5)OP: People getting power-ups just because they can. Zoro was slashed with a proper sword after already being beaten up and then thrown into a wall suddenly awakens a power and defeats the villain. I bet people wouldn't even be able to figure out which arc I am talking about cause it happens IN EVERY ARC. 6)Plot armor: No one dies. Not even the side characters. People getting shocked by millions of volts are just charred and then they make a joke about being fried rather than dying (btw humans die from 100-250V). Every shounen has plot armor, there is no getting around that, but the fact that it is just being slammed into your face every 5 episodes is just insulting. 7)Villains: Every Villian is pathetic. Facts. 8) Too many fights at the same time. In every arc the group is split up so there are multiple fights that are going on simultaneously. There are times I had forgotten a fight was even happening cause it wasn't even mentioned in the next 1 or 2 episodes. Yet there are still more cons that I can talk about. Oda has made an absolutely stunning world don't get me wrong. It is very satisfying when plot points that are hinted at hundreds of episodes before are paid off but you can't possibly say that this anime is good, let alone great, just on the basis of world-building and character backstory (not development because there is none). Frankly I possibly don't like this cause I have jumped on this bandwagon far too late. I know for a fact I would have liked this show when I was a kid and nostalgia would have done the rest. If anyone wants to jump on this, only do so if you have an ungodly amount of spare time on your hand (which you probably shouldn't and should use it more productively unlike me).",3,Not Recommended,"May 24, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_acfa5f7b32,12,3742
"The great One Piece! One Piece for me was a relationship of love and obligation at first, I felt that as an otaku I was obliged to watch this work because it is the biggest Shounen in terms of episodes and it is also one of the most famous. When I started watching it, I watched it very quickly, I couldn't get much of an attachment to the openings and endings because of that (with the exception of ""We Are""), I watched One Piece in just a month and a half while the episodes of the Whole Cake arc were released. At first I simply wanted to finish it quickly and add it to my list of completed animes, but over time I started to like it until I reached a point where I fell in love with the work, the characters are very charismatic, the universe is rich and full of connections between them, the work brings many concepts, many reflections and many dilemmas (I remember these things happening more before the time-skip). The characters are very, very well developed. As an example, I would like to mention my favorite character in the series, which is without a doubt Ace. First, Ace was the reason Luffy wanted to go to sea and after that he became a character completely independent of Luffy. Even though Luffy is the protagonist, I believe that everyone who watched One Piece watched an anime just about Ace and his adventures, and that is exactly the point. A character who can stand alone in a series is not that rare, but several characters in a series is very rare. I can mention other examples such as Sabo, Roger, Xebec, Garp, Whitebeard, and others. However, it is worth mentioning something: when I got to the Whole Cake arc, that was when I really felt the problem with the work. As I said in my review of One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen, I repeat here: One Piece is incredible. What is wrong with it is the fact that the work is very, very dragged out. Out of 24 minutes of each episode, only 14/16 minutes are of new stuff. This annoys anyone over time and drives new fans away from consuming the work, since it would already be long even without these things. Even with these problems, One Piece continues to be one of my favorite works because of the care and development that the author has with the work. I continue to give it a solid 9. =================================================================================================================Versão em Português===================================== O grandioso One Piece! One Piece pra mim foi uma relação de amor e obrigação no inicio, senti que como otaku era obrigado a ver essa obra pois é o maior Shounen em questão de episódios e tambem é um dos mais famosos. Quando comecei a assistir eu assisti muito rapido, não consegui pegar muito apego pelas aberturas e pelas ending por causa disso (com exceção de ""We Are""), assisti One Piece em apenas um mês e meio enquanto lançava os episódios do arco de Whole Cake. No começo simplesmente queria acabar logo e colocar na minha lista de animes concluídos mas com o tempo fui pegando gosto até chegar em um ponto que me apaixonei pela obra, os personagens são muito carismáticos, o universo é rico e cheio de ligações entre si, a obra traz muitos conceitos, muitas reflexões e muitos dilemas (lembro dessas coisas ocorrerem mais pré time-skip). Os personagens são muito mas muito bem desenvolvidos, como exemplo queria citar o meu personagem favorito da obra que sem sombra de duvidas é o Ace, primeiro, Ace foi o motivo de Luffy querer ir ao mar e depois disso ele se tornou um personagem completamente independe do Luffy, mesmo que o Luffy seja o protagonista, creio que todos que assistiram One Piece assistiram um anime só do Ace e suas aventuras e é exatamente esse o ponto, um personagem que consegue se manter sozinho em uma obra não é tão raro, mas diversos personagens em uma obra é muito raro, posso citar outros exemplos como o Sabo, Roger, Xebec, Garp, Barba Branca e entre outros. Porem vale citar algo, quando cheguei no arco de Whole Cake foi ai que senti de fato o problema da obra, como falei na minha review de One Piece: Gyojin Tou-hen repito aqui, One Piece é incrível, o que peca nele é o fato da obra ser muito mas muito arrastada, de 24 minutos de episodio, somente 14/16 minutos são de coisas novas, isso chateia qualquer um ao longo do tempo e afasta novos fãs a consumir a obra visto que ela já seria longa mesmo sem essas coisas. Mesmo com esses problemas, One Piece continua sendo um das minhas obras favoritas pelo carinho e pelo desenvolvimento que o autor possui com a obra.

"This is the first review I have ever written, or even plan to write, so give me a break. To sum up ""One Piece"" in a single word, I would have to say AMAZING. Everything about it represents why I love watching anime. The fact that I am still watching it now after 550 episodes, and still wanting more is enough to show just how great it is. The only negative aspect about the show is also a good thing. There a simply a TON of episodes. In order to start one piece you need to be willing to dedicate days of time towards it. But if you love One Piece, like I do, then the fact that there are so many episodes is actually the best part about it! Im not the type of person to go in depth about things, so I will keep this brief. One Piece offers a simple, yet genius story. Has an amazing cast of characters. Has a variety of different elements, including comedy, action, adventures, tear-jerking scenes, and even a little romance. AND WHO DOESN""T LOVE PIRATES? COME ON!

"One Piece is an anime frequently classified with Bleach and Naruto as one of the ""Big 3"" in anime and manga. These 3 have ruled at the top in terms of popularity for over a decade, and their popularity is still high as ever, if not higher. I personally find it really hard to get into long-running animes (+100) but surprisingly, One Piece was an exception, a rare one at that. One Piece was one of my first anime I've watched. (first being pokemon ofc) It was the anime that got me into anime, especially when there was a time where I thought anime was boring and a waste of time. I literally thought that they didn't have anything special about it. However, after getting a recommendation from my brother, One Piece really changed my views on anime. Since I barely knew about anime at that time, I was really intrigued by the aspect of pirates and adventure. I watched one episode, then another, and another... and I was hooked to the show in no time at all. Because I was impressed by One Piece, I started watching other shows, mostly of the similar genre. From then, my love for anime has grew and grew, and is still growing to this day and it's all thanks to one great piece of anime. One Piece takes place during the Great Age of Pirates, which started when the King of Pirates, Gol D. Roger announced to the world shortly before his death that he had hidden his greatest treasure, the ""One Piece"" somewhere, and told others to find it. About 20 years later, a boy named Monkey D. Luffy, who ate the Gomu Gomu no mi devil fruit, also interested in finding the One Piece and exploring the world, sets out on a journey full of exciting adventures, dangerous pirates and marines, and meeting new friends. From there, he makes many new comrades to support his journey. The story itself seems nothing special, but it evolves as the time goes on. At the time of writing this review, One Piece is at 670 episodes, which might tell you that it is rather drawn out. However, during those 670 episodes, they slowly build the world and characters into something unique and huge, enhancing the story bit by bit. The story arcs are fantastic and well thought out, sometimes leaving you in awe. In the story arcs, you are usually introduced to other minor characters, some who are equally interesting to watch just as the main characters. And the fights as a whole, are really well paced and entertaining, mixing blends of action, humor, and drama to keep you hooked. Also, like most other long running anime, One Piece does have its share of fillers. BUT, they have nowhere near an overwhelming amount of fillers and some fillers can even be enjoyable as well. The fillers also introduce you to new characters, who although non-canon, are still pretty likable as well. Like many other animes, One Piece also has a system of supernatural powers. In the world of One Piece, there are things known as Devil Fruits, which essentially take the shape of real-life fruits, but taste horrible and give consumers a unique power. Depending on the user and how they use it, the Devil Fruit can become something very powerful. The concept of the Devil Fruit is one of the most impressive aspects of One Piece. There are three types of known Devil Fruit: Paramecia, which gives you the ability of superhuman ability or traits, Zoan which lets you transform into an animal, and finally Logia, which can transform your body into an element like fire or ice. The idea of eating something and getting superpowers is nothing new, but the fact that One Piece has shown an immense amount of Devil Fruits already, and that no two fruits are ever the same, is quite impressive. Oda really exercised his creativity level on this part, as while some abilities might come off as goofy, you cannot deny the creativity and work Oda put into some of the fruits and their users. For the Art... now this is the section I've heard the MOST complaints about. To be honest, I was bit skeptical myself when I first saw the art style. It can come off as cartoonish, childish drawing for the most parts, possibly turning off viewers. However, as I watched on and on, I forgot about it. After a couple of episodes, I honestly didn't CARE for how the art looked, as I was just immensely enjoying the hell out of the show. It's really a hit or miss however, as it can turn many people off completely, while others might not be bothered by it so much. Also, nowadays, the art in One Piece has improved dramatically. It is much more pleasing to the eye than it ever was. The artwork is fresh and clean. The character designs are also outstanding as well. Some might be drawn rather silly, but the uniqueness in some of the character art is very fun to look at. Now, I've heard some people say that the soundtracks are rather silly and lame. This really depends on your tastes in music, but I personally found most of the soundtracks amazing. While some of them do come off as silly, the osts all fit the scene and atmosphere very well. The voice acting is also equally impressive, with each of the voice actors fitting their characters perfectly, and also being able to deliver emotion, or intensity depending on the scene. The characters in the Straw Hat Pirates are special. Not really because they will be the most unique characters you'll ever see, but because of the bond they share with each other. The characters are very well developed, have interesting/fun personalities, and most importantly, they are easy to love. They all have interesting backgrounds, some which are tragic, and are striving to achieve their dreams as they adventure together. As they travel along, they start to care for each other so deeply to the point where they would do anything to protect each other, creating extremely powerful and emotional episodes or arcs at some point. The Straw Hat crew members are exceptionally great, but the supporting characters themselves are no slouch either. Most of them are designed well and have unique, interesting personalities. Unlike many anime, they aren't just pushed to the side, no. Most of them have interesting, yet traguc backgrounds and goals, and you can't help but cheer for them as they try to achieve their own goals. Some even are just as lovable as the main characters themselves! Hell, I even cheered for some of the antagonists at one point as well, as they were just too likable and unique. One Piece is an amazing anime. Although not perfect, it still is one of the most fun and entertaining experience I've ever had. I know many people who won't even give One Piece a chance for couple of reasons. Most are turned away by the art, some are discouraged because of the episode count, and some are even victims of the infamous 4kids dub (which was HORRIBLE btw). Well, I can't force people to watch it, but I really think everyone should give One Piece at least a chance. In one anime, you'll be taken through a journey full of adventure, good action, comedy, and drama. Who knows? You could enjoy the hell out of this show, and possibly forget about every downsides I mentioned above. I sure did, and maybe you could as well, if you just give it a try.",9,Recommended,"Aug 26, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cbb25d39a0,12,7146

"I make this clear. I'm not a fanboy who only seen this serie and proclaims that it is the best thing in the world. I saw so many anime and I truly think that One Piece is ONE of the best anime/manga of all Time. The plot is incredible and the cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in anime and the seiyuu who play them fit perfectly into it. Luffy and his friends makes you cry like a bitch and laugh like a cow and THAT'S the awesomeness of One Piece. I had goose bumps when Robin says "" I WANNA LIVE "". I cried for Ace in MarineFord. I was laughing out loud when Zorro get Lost. (9999 times) I was pissed of when Kuma detroyed the "" Mugiwara "" ! The Storyline is so complex that characters are only growing up and make them more Interesting and it's clever from Oda to enlarge the univers of One Piece before developing a Character. That's why One Piece is awesome. It makes you feel full of emotion and not many anime do the same. For me One piece is just a Masterpiece and thank god it's still going on !",10,Recommended,"Nov 8, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3cc738bcd6,12,1045
"One Piece is and will always be one of my favorite anime shows, however there are some things that could have been better. Story: 9 The story of One Piece started out pretty simple. Become the king of the pirates. In a way, to me this is similar to Naruto's goal of becoming Hokage. We all know its going to happen, we just don't know how. In order to reach this simple goal, many smaller goals take place. This includes finding a ship, gaining crew members, crossing the grand line, and finding the pirate king's treasure and each of these smaller goals contain more objectives within. It's these simpler objectives that makes the main goal of the story better. The reason why this is not a 10 is because the story is sometimes repetitive. For example, each time a new crew member is introduced it goes like this; New member introduced, member in some kind of trouble, main character helps new member, new member becomes official. This happens EVERY time. Although its predictable, this is still enjoyable because we get to see the process of how it happens. Art: 7 You've probably already heard the artwork sucks. To me this is not the case. Yeah, in the first couple of arcs the artwork could have been better, but they were never terrible. Keep in mind the show was out for 15 years. As time progressed, so did the artwork. Now, I'd say the art is actually pretty good. Not the best, but not bad either. Sound: 10 I don't have much to say about the sound. The music fits the theme of the show and makes it that much better. Character: 9 The character development is great! Throughout the show, the viewers grow closer to each of the characters. I'm not an emotional person, however there were a couple of times where because I was so attached to the characters, tears began to form once something bad happened. The only flaw yet again is that it repeats itself. One way that the viewers grow towards the characters is that each time a new one is introduced, there is a flashback of the character as a child showing the hardships they went through. Yes, this is a good way to help the audience relate to the character, but to do this every time starts to take away from the show a little. Enjoyment: 10 As mentioned before, this will always be one of my favorites. The show has everything I enjoy. The action scenes are exciting, the story keeps me interested, just the right amount of comedy without going over the top, emotional moments, and the perfect amount of fan service ( after time skip it gets heavier, but I don't mind ). I enjoyed this show so much I started it last summer, and caught up to the story line within the same summer. Overall: I say overall this anime is a 9 simply because of the repetition, and the number of episodes. The storyline and everything else is amazing, but now a days people are busy and they don't have enough time to catch up on 685 episodes. And to watch all these episodes knowing how the process will take place at times is kind of a drag. Thanks for taking the time to read my review. This is my first anime review ever.

"Okay so this is my first review and let me start off by saying that i wont give a 3 hour summary on one piece. But instead, i will tell you what you will be going through while you watch this anime. When you watch this anime you will laugh, get angry, smile, be pumped up, stressed, frustrated, happy ,cry and so many other emotions that i cant explain. The reason you will be going through this is because when you watch this anime you will grow so attached to each character and how they feel you will feel like they are part of your family. I used to hate this show because i saw a couple of episodes on tv and didnt give it a chance but then by friend told me that if i didnt at least like the anime by episode180 he would give me 20 dollars. So i watched the anime from episode 1 to 180 and fell in love with it but i told my friend i hated it still and got that 20 dollars. But the point is that if you watch at least 180 episodes you will love it. I know most of you are thinking that if it takes 180 episodes to like something is wayyy to long but the reason that is, is because within that time span you will get to know and become friends with the characters. SO I GIVE ANYONE WHO READS THIS THE 180 CHALLENGE!!!!! If you take this challenge you must watch 180 episodes of one piece and if you dont like it by then, you can give yourself 20 dollars!!!!

"One piece tells the story of a young man who sets out the become king of the pirates ina world scattered with so many other pirates. To some, this may not sound interesting, and it didn't sound interesting to me at first either. But deep down One Piece is not a story about pirates. It is a story that takes time to show you and explore it's world with the characters, and go along the journey with them. The development for certain characters is great. The story has to probably make this one of the most political anime ever. It covers racism, corrupt government, and the idea of justice magnificently, and incorporates it into the story exceptionally. If you haven't started it you should. It may not interest you at first, but give it time, skip filler, and all of it will pay off.",10,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a284bc5ff1,12,785
"Before I started watching it I never considered once this series would become such a big part of my life, not just mine but my friends and siblings also. It's a fantastic show to have a matron through, granted it has a slow start but you'll soon get into it after a couple of episodes, and once you do I can assure you you're going to kiss your social life good bye! Don't let the odd art style or ridiculous number of episodes deter you from watching this masterpiece. There will never be a boring moment. It has a truly amazing cast of characters that you will come to love as you learn about their stories and watch them grow. One Piece is a fantastic adventure with epic fight scenes, imaginative characters, wild landscapes, and unforgettable music. You will laugh, cry, feel anger, sadness, and joy as you make your way through the Straw Hats' epic quest. This is the story of Monkey D.

"i only liked pretty characters and shoujo with romance stories and no action.. BUT one piece is the only exception!!! The characters weren't so pretty, there's no romnce anddd its filled with action. i thought i'd hate it, but then i ended up falling in love with it Story:The story is AMAZING!!! there's funny times sad times annoyoing times everything! It's like almost as old as me! The story would totally make you wanna keep on watching Art: Of course when i watched the first episodes i reallly disliked how they were drawn and i dont like how they're drawn frequently either. they were perfectly drawn in 2009 though. I think they're adding way too much boobs on the girls:/ Character: Of course since this story began before everything else (except pokemon which was only a year older) The main characters have their own uniqe personalities that you cant find anywhere else. they even have their own laughs. I TOTALLY LOVE IT!!! There's a reason why its been going on for the past 13 years!!!

"Plot: Original plot and storyline. It's easy to follow. There're not a lot of fillers. You can always go to animefillerlist.com if you want to see which episodes are fillers. It'll make you cry and it'll make you laugh. Just watch it. Art: Don't judge the anime just on the art. I'm not going to lie, it's a little funky in the beginning. The art gets SO good later on in the series. I'm getting tired of people only watching the first episode and then they go and talk shit about the anime. At least, watch multiple episodes. Sound: The best voice actors ever. The dub voice actors are really good as well. So if you're the kind of person who prefers dub over sub, then you're in good hands. I can't praise the voice acting enough. Soundtrack: Really enjoyable music. The openings are so hyped. Characters: I just love the characters. The characters are so funny and just really enjoyable. You really get into the characters. I rarely find any characters in One Piece annoying. And the character development is pretty good. Overall: A bomb as anime. Don't hesitate, just watch.

"STORY: 10 ART: 7 ANIMATION: 6 SOUND: 6 CHARACTERS: 10 ENJOYMENT: 9 OVERALL:9 or 10 (Currently during Post time skip: 7.5) INTRO: I started One Piece because I noticed it was placed pretty high on the TOP anime list here (#38 at the time). And I was just thinking ""WHY? Looks shitty"". Anyway I felt like trying out another long running series at the time cause I was starting to get real bored with the other big shounens, and perhaps the genre itself. ""WTH I'll give it a go"". 6 years later. I don't regret. ONE PIECE IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE!!! It does not fall short compared to other battle shounens. I guarantee you. Looks kiddy in regards to the art, and the silliness it dishes out often, but it's no way a show just for kids like pokemon or Yu-gi-oh. Aight? STORY: Our main cast are pirates! They're actually the supposed bad guys here. They are not do-gooders. They just do whatever the hell they want, and sometimes that includes helping people, and kicking the other evil guys' butt. Their enemies and conflicts will arise from other pirates, the marines, and the world Government. The core element is adventure. It's adventure-plot driven. It's starts off with them island hopping, getting entangled in new stories, cultures, kicking the bad guy's ass, but the island hopping isn't all that random. They pertain to the main overarching plot, and to get to the final destination, well they gotta go to some places. In each arc, you'll obtain some piece of information that is relevant to the main story. The further you go in, you'll notice it becomes more and more connected to the overall arching plot. I wanna talk a little bit about the world of One Piece. In terms of world building, OP does more of it and better than most. ODA gave himself lots of leg room to work with yo. OP has this 'don't take me too seriously vibe' which helps us not to criticize it too much for some of the weirder things, yet it still manages to make it quite believable. A few minor things might not make sense, but overall it works. The plot is more complex than what it appears. The plot will grow, conflicts will arise, so many many awesome people you will meet, and even see again. Oda does a great job at seeding things in early on and tying them together later. And there are still many intriguing mysteries that are still yet to be solved even after 700 episodes. The world of One Piece is big, but the best thing is that it all feels connected. ART: Old, weird, fugly art at the beginning. Overtime style evolves a bit, and looks a lot better. I've come to personally love the style, especially the manga art. Gotta let it grow on you. Animation is acceptable-ish overall, later on before time skip it seems to get pretty good! Then after time skip it kinda goes to shit again. CHARACTER: This is the place where OP shines. THE CHARACTERS MAN. MANY ARE UNIQUE (some more than others), WEIRD, QUIRKY, BADASS, AND JUST PLAIN AWESOME. The characters are really something. I end up liking a lot of them, even ones where I initially thought wouldn't amount to anything worthy of attention. Oda gives his little imaginary people, character that you just can't help but end up liking despite how utterly bizarre they look sometimes. And in this grand OP world, you are going to be running into many different people. The OP cast is huge, some are one-dimensional, but many leave an impression on you. ENJOYMENT: PROS: Before I knew it, I end up loving the characters and their interactions with one another. Strong feels. I laugh, shed some manly tears, can really feel the anger of the characters. This show makes me feel lots during their adventures, but mostly this show puts a smile on my face. Good mix of comedy and serious business. Some of my favorite moments are just when the crew's hanging out on their ship, relaxing. Not a lot of fillers compared to other shounens either, and even when there are fillers, it's short, there for comedy sake, and fun to watch. I think the story & writing is really good, not cliche, and keeps me hooked. Unpredictable often, and I'm just sitting back and enjoying the ride. CONS: Might be a rough start for some, slow-paced as fuck at times/drawn out scenes in order to not catch up to the manga, seldom boring ass fodder villains (mostly during the start), excessive booby fan-service recently, can get repetitive, post time skip is starting to feel like your typical boring shounen. There are so many episodes, so of course there will be some boring ones. OVERALL: After all that praising, there will still be people who won't like it at all. It's because we're all fucking different and value different things. There are those who ONLY like watching mature, seinen, deep, intellectual, realistic animes who will find One Piece childish, and just not their thing. Then there are those who are more flexible and can enjoy the above listed and all kinds of other animes, and can appreciate humor, etc etc, AND WOULD STILL assume One Piece to be a trashy children's show just based on first impressions. I'm here to help the latter group of people, (who are able to enjoy a wide variety of anime like cowboy bebop, FMA, DBZ, Naruto, etc all at the same time) to understand that One Piece isn't as childish/retarded as they might initially think, and that they might enjoy it. It's not a kiddy or lame as Pokemon, Yugioh (no hate for these guys btw). One piece has comedy, but also has a serious story, and based on the numbers/facts, many do indeed, find it interesting. So give it a chance if you are on the fence about it. DROP IT if you absolutely HATE the first 150 episodes, BUT STILL BE AWARE that the story does get better and deeper the further you go in. (Isn't it like that for all big shounens?) It's not perfect. Why is it so popular then? Because it's just so damn enjoyable to watch despite some of its' flaws. For whatever reason, it clicked in the right way for a lot of us, and we just can't get enough of it. To be able to enjoy and be entertained. Isn't that all we want from a show? Another thing. I don't know about you guys, but OP feels more badass and less corny(?) to me than most of the other battle shounens. Can't explain it too well. TL;DR // RECOMMENDED FOR: So finally, if you love shounen such as DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, Fairy Tail, bleach, Gintama, HxH, and/or Hitman Reborn, and haven't tried One Piece, please do come see what the fuss is about. There's a good chance you might enjoy One Piece too. OP is sometimes sillier than some of these other titles and some people really don't have tolerance for that, and would prefer darker vibes like HxH, BUT if you're FLEXIBLE (you like all kinds of anime), give it a chance. TRUST ME, OP DOES NOT FALL SHORT IN TERMS OF STORY & SERIOUSNESS. Please, don't judge a book by its' cover. It is my favorite of the long battle shounens, and the only one of its' kind to have kept me interested this long. This is coming from someone who isn't a big fan of long battle shounens in the first place. If I were to grade the anime a little more fairly, I would give it a 7 or 8 because sometimes the animation quality drops, and also sometimes Toei adds useless scenes, or drags out certain boring scenes, and there are those boring episodes with boring badguys once in awhile. And also some little plot flaws like how a character never dies, etc. But if I were to grade it based on how much I fucking enjoy One Piece, it's story and characters overall, I give it a 10. So overall, anime One Piece gets 9/10 from me. Advice: For the love of God, don't go skipping around arcs. You're not gonna get that build up feel, and connection to the characters, which is important here. If you're gonna dedicate yourself to understanding OP, if you wanna understand why the fans love OP, it's best to watch all the arcs, (minus foxy arc unless you don't mind more comedy). Or better yet, just read the damn manga instead. The manga is perfect, the anime can sometimes be a little horrendous with the dragging and the unnecessary scenes. And again, if you find the first 100 or so episodes TERRIBLY unbearable, it probably isn't your thing.",9,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_41f05e0e65,12,8166
Is it useful to describe One piece? Its just one of the master piece of this kind of manga. At the beginning the art can be difficult to come in. But when your are in the story you can not stop to watch the anime. The story start slowly but everything become definitely more exciting when they come to the great road.

"Well, i doubt my review will be seen out of hundreds of thers yet i still wanted to talk about the cr*p which i regretted time i wasted on it and warn those who are about to start this veery long series. STORY: One piece is about anything but pirates. First of all keep in mind that it is no where about a deep story. It is all just repetitive arcs of same concept again and again: mc, Luffy, goes to a village, fools around and makes friend with someone there(of course his new friend has a long tragic backstory like everyone else before, nearly 15% of whole one piece is about those sad backstories of characters), some bad guy who responsible for his/her bad days will torment MC's friend again. His new friend will cry and mc will shout angrily ""i gonna beat the f*** of him"". Luffy will lose the first part of the fight, he needs some rest time now. Meanwhile Luffy's each crew members are about the beat their own opponents. After life and death situation Luffy will get some power-up somehow and when he gather all his power in his last punch his oppenent will fall in slow motion with hype music in background. Now all left is his recover from his injuries and then he can celebrate his victory with all people of village. His new friend high probably will join the crew and Luffy will go to next city to repeat all those things. Luckily all those strong guys who could kill MC with his fart won't be there or let him get away. Yep, that's what basicly one piece is. You'll also see some mysterious shadow characters or bigshots at the end of arcs who is affecting direction of main story. As story continues power balance turns to sh*t. Mysterious powers once claimed to be rare now are too common. There are too much plot armors and very rarely someone dies or lose their limbs. No mind blowing turns in story just ""ta ta ta ta ta. power of whatever!"" straight fights. Side characters and minions will wait while others fight(well, can't blame too much since it is hard to animate and direct). Running in city is as long as Tsubasa characters reaching goalkeeper. Also world goverment now has hyperinflation with bounties. Why they even bothering putting those bounties while all they do is feeding them in prison forever instead execute them no matter how dangerous they are or what crimes they commit? To let them escape from prison someday so that they could get their part in story? Also technology will get sudden revolution out of blue but will not be used in fights for no reason. Why even minions of both sides using swords if machine guns and explosives exist now? How come world's power balance remained largely unchanged for dozens of years but with mc's generation everything turned upside down in just 2-3 years? If it was that simple why other power holders didn't try that before? Even pirate king wasn't that fast. They getting power-ups way too fast. I wish they have been aged instead, like 10-20 years, as story continues. I like fantasy stories but once it breaks it's own world building rules it does not makes sense anymore. And biggest problem is pacing that turned to total torture after time skip. If anime catchs manga either go for season break or reduce episode duration from 24 min to 14 min ART: There is the rule thing for shounen mangakas: draw every character as distinguishable just by looking at their shadows. After hundreds of characters Oda lost of ideas, now characters not even look any human anymore! All absurdly big bodies with strange and clown-ish faces, and females sexualised too much with absurd body portions. Nothing impressive about background art neither. CHARACTERS: What made one piece great was it's characters. Especially MC, Luffy, used to be very eccentric character that it is hard to guess what he gonna do next. He was so funny but also mature in some way and my very first reason i was enjoying this series. But now he lost all his charm after time skip arc that his movements feels too blank. Not just him, other character's writing turned mess too. Instead of getting deeper character development(i don't talk about their power levels) now they all have simple predictable blank personalities. All has own some lines with behaviours and just repeating those whenever they appear. Honestly one piece long lost it's atmosphere. Oda's another mistake was he made one of key member of crew, Usopp, as unlikeable weak ugly guy. What even made him think that would be a good idea? What's most irritating thing is that there is no even pirate like pirates in this pirate story except fews in early parts. They are all heroes, challengers, ideologists, weirdos,evil merchants, mafia etc. And there is almost none pirate who has sword. How come this is a pirate show? And later in story Oda makes everyone crying damn too much with snot leaking from their nose in order to make the scene look more impressive and dramatic, but it rather damaging atmasphere more with that absurdity. Mature/realistic acting characters are very few, personalites are straight and don't change a lot. Most of them written as simple absolute bad or absolute good characters. Every new character always has different weird laughing style which becomes annoying later MUSIC: It is nice but that stingy studio still using same soundtracks even after thousand of episodes? Why don't they bother to make new ones while they milking all those money from One Piece. And sound effects that used in fights are really bad SUMMARY: What made One Piece one of the most popular eseries ever is it's never ending hype that audiences have. Maybe that could be the reason that producers never go for season breaks while everyone is complaning about pacing: to not let that hype ever die. I doubt if this hype could contunie otherwise. I stopped around episode 980 and saying ""i'll return after i pile some episedes"", but i never had a single urge to return back in last 3 years. “People all around the world are in search of the greatest treasure ever” has really good potential and something i would want to watch, but One Piece failed it. It could be executed much better. I wish there was more mysterious fantasy stuff of world building ,and tension that make you wonder what'll happen next and if anyone is gonna die or survive. I hope this thing could get a seinen spin-off someday in future with clear of it's plot holes and more realistic characters. A bit hunterxhunter like approach in story building would be nice too In conclude, if you don't value your time and just want to enjoy your day like watching a saturday cartoon go ahead, i throughly enjoyed earlier parts as well. It was funny. But don't expect too much later, you may regret.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 11, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2460fac579,12,6680
"One Peak, absolute cinema. The story and world building of One Piece is amazing. No arc feels boring or out of place. Each arc tells an amazing story of Luffy and his crew fighting against the corruption of the world. The art style is amazing. Personally I enjoy the art style pre-timeskip but the art is still really good, especially the fight scenes. The choreography and overall art of One Piece's fight scenes are unmatched. The characters are super fun too. Luffy is a bright shining star acting as the light that guides the people around him. My personal favorite character is Zoro because of his often serious and stern person, however he has a lot of funny and goofy moments with the crew. I think the main issue people have with one piece is the length and all I have to say to that is that its worth it.",10,Recommended,"Jul 6, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e8c1fd99e5,12,813
"GrandLineReview, I am calling you out. This is a review mainly focused on the post-time skip era of One Piece in comparison to the pre-time skip. To sum it all up, post-time skip is a shell of its former self. And why is that? Well, it’s because Oda has changed what he is prioritizing. In the pre-time skip days, Oda focused on character development as the top priority, followed by action, and then lastly, world building. The post-time skip One Piece has focused mainly on world building, followed by action, and very far back is character development. What made me – and many others - get into One Piece were the main characters, the Straw Hats. Watching the Straw Hats interact with each other and building their friendships was very entertaining. This is because all of them were likable and interesting characters – well, excluding Franky. Franky was never given a character; other than being the robot guy. Since the time skip, our main characters aren’t really main characters anymore. The only exception is Luffy, who is always front and center. The plot no longer focuses on developing the Straw Hats. Nami and Robin are nothing more than fanservice nowadays; they barely do ANYTHING. Usopp is little more than the prototypical coward, and Chopper is just a mascot now. His monster point transformation, which was once the most fascinating thing about Chopper, has become a joke. Brook is still funny, but he never had as much development as the other characters anyway. The worst thing for Brook is that he joined too late in the series when One Piece was already getting more “kooky” and “zany”, meaning that any possible character focus he could’ve gotten had he shown up earlier is now a pipe-dream. Zoro does have cool moments and fights, but he been pushed aside by other characters like Law; who take on the role of second-in-command for long stretches at a time. And then there is Franky, who is a robot. This all leads us to Sanji. My god, Sanji, what have they done to you? After being chased by trans people for two years, he’s then given the laughable story arc of almost dying constantly because he gets noise bleeds from seeing girls. Fucking girls. Yes, he was like always like Brock from Pokemon, but after the time skip he is LITERALLY pushed to death’s door from seeing women! Also, Sanji has been getting his ass kicked in 1-one-1fights to everyone. “Hold on!” You must be saying, “Sanji got his own arc, right?” Yes, you are right, because after destroying a beloved character and turning him into a joke, you kind of need to find a way to fix him so the fans don’t rage. Enter the Whole Cake Island story, where Sanji redeems himself by: getting his ass kicked by his father, baking a cake, and getting a ridiculous Power Rangers suit. In short, he doesn’t do anything. They do touch on his childhood, but it’s pointless anyway, because all we find out is that he wants to be a cook, and that he had a shitty life as a child. Sanji, as a character, doesn’t change from beginning to end throughout the Whole Cake Island arc. Bafflingly, it is Luffy who develops far more in Sanji’s own arc. At some point, Sanji has his hero’s journey hijacked, and it ends up being Luffy who transforms and receives the gifts of goodness. Do I think Oda hates Sanji and the Straw Hats? No! That’s a really foolish conclusion to come to. Likewise, it would be just as foolish to believe these low quality character arcs indicate that Oda likes Sanji (wow, GrandLineReview). Only an idiot would present the false dichotomy that Oda either loves or hates Sanji. The actual answer is that he just doesn’t care about him – or the other Straw Hats - as much as he cares about world building. World building has become the main driver in this series. To understand how, I will split up world building into two categories: first is the design of characters and the world at large, and the second category is the actual characters in the world. In regards to the first category, the different locations the straw-hats go to after the time skip are certainly crazy. Each new place seems to top the last, but none of them are bad. The character designs, on the other hand, are just ridiculous now. While it is true that the people in One Piece always looked goofy, Oda has turned it up the silliness to eleven. These are just nitpicks, however. For the second category, we come to the main problem with world building: the side characters in every location that get pushed to main character status. This is a very bad situation, because it means that in each new story arc, you will have Luffy, and at least one other side character that gets the focus, major character moments, and development. It happens in every arc: in Fishmen Island, it is Luffy, Jinbe, and Shirahoshi; in Punk Hazard: it’s Luffy, Law, Smoker, Momonosuke, and Kinemon; in Dressrosa, we have Luffy, Rebeca, Law, Bellamy, Sabo, Kyros; and now in Wano, there’s Luffy and every side-character (way too many to count). Wano is somewhat better, because Zoro is being focussed on too - which is a breath of fresh air, but doesn’t change the point being made here. Even in Whole Cake Island, we have characters like Pedro who get better moments than Sanji – who is the guy that the arc is supposed to be about. Now, I am not saying the development these characters are getting is bad (because it really isn’t), but I didn’t start watching this show for these minor characters. I don’t care about these minor characters. While it is nice to have a few, I care about the Straw Hats, and I do not enjoy them being pushed off to the sidelines with absolutely nothing to do. This is not to say this writing style is bad necessarily. The Alabasta arc had some of these traits and was great nonetheless, but having this type of story for five straight arcs while the main crew is neglected starts to get annoying. When you look at One Piece pre-time skip - specifically arcs like Water 7 - the characters being focussed on were Robin, Usopp, Franky, and Luffy. Then you had awesome smaller arcs like Whisky Peak with great character development for Zoro, Luffy, Nami and Vivi. Enies Lobby is pretty much about Robin, while every Straw Hat gets their own fight and chance to develop. Some of the best moments of the show took place when the main cast was given the attention and focus, and those arcs were great because we dealt with characters that Oda took the time to develop over years; he didn’t start shoving new characters for us to care about down our throats in every single arc. The action in One Piece is great throughout, so comparisons between pre- and post-timeskip is a wash. I will just mention that fights actually are very important in developing characters (contrary to what some idiots presume). The fact is that characters not having fights and not winning fights will ruin any character (Sanji). What makes fights so important to One Piece is not the action per se, but the idea that your life is at stake and they need to find any way to survive. Seeing how far you will go to become stronger when the chips are down was a way we were able to gain insights into most of the Straw Hats early in the series. It doesn’t matter what your role on the ship is: whether you’re a swordsman driven to finally cut steel in pursuit of becoming the best; or a doctor that is forced to the point of eating three rumble balls just to live and not let his friends down. Whether people want to admit it or not, fights are important to everyone in One Piece. Sanji’s best moments were against the wolf guy in Enies Lobby, and part of that was because we saw his intelligence at work. SIDE-NOTE: GrandLineReview, you cannot make a video jerking off to the fight between Luffy and Katakuri, then turn around and say fight aren’t important to character development for a main Straw Hat fighter in Sanji. One Piece is a shonen, after all. Why do I think Oda changed the formula to One Piece? Well, I think Marineford had a major part to play in this. Marineford was an arc that really focused on how grand the One Piece world really is, and since on Luffy was the only Straw Hat present, other characters who probably wouldn’t have that much screen time were suddenly pushed front and center. And what was the result of that arc? One Piece exploded in popularity, and the sales of One Piece manga took off into space. I don’t think it’s too much to assume that Oda saw what happened, and shifted the series more in the direction that made it so popular. Another problem with this show is pacing. The series moves so slow that it takes forever for anything to happen. And no, I’m not just talking about the anime. People assume that the manga itself is infallible and perfect paced, but the reality is that it is also INCREDIBLY slow. The anime makes this problem much worse, but this effect is only so unbearable because of how badly paced the series is in the first place. Whenever a new One Piece arc starts, I actually think to myself, “Great! I’ll check back in two years when they stop faffing about and the story starts getting good.” Side Note: The manga is horribly drawn. Oda shoves so much stuff in one panel that you have no clue what the characters are actually doing, and every chapter looks like a shit-show is taking place. This might piss some people off, but really, some of these panels are inscrutable as hell. Before some idiot messages me saying that I lack the perception to discern what is happening, this is not just me. I’ve watched videos of people reviewing manga chapters, and they will have completely different interpretations of what is happening in certain scenes. This is not an issue with me, this is Oda throwing too much shit on the page. The bottom line is that there is something very wrong with what One Piece has become. There are a few signs that things are improving a little with Wano, but it genuinely feels like this series has lost part of its soul. We began with a small crew of really good people that you actually loved watching interact with each other. Some of my favourite moments in the entire series would be the parts between major arcs, when these awesome characters would be travelling on the Going Merry living with each other; they felt like a family, and I cared about every one of them (well, maybe not Franky). You don’t get this feeling anymore. In many ways, the move from the Going Merry to the Sunny is symbolic of One Piece as a whole: we have moved from a humbler, deeply personal adventure to an overblown and gimmicky monstrosity. The Straw Hats don’t feel like a family anymore, and they feel less real. The focus of the story is almost never on them being together anymore, with Oda opting to focus on building his big shiny world. The reality is that modern One Piece has become a caricature of itself, and whatever gave this series its soul died by the time skip.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8211aa1154,12,10900

"One piece is my favorite anime of all time. I started watching it when i was around 8-10 years old, it was on the morning tv shows i would wake up early just to watch it. Later that day i would meet with my friends, we would chose one of the characters and play, i was Zoro so i had to go around looking for sticks to pretend they d be my all mighty swords. After it stopped airing i grew up and i forgot about it. At the age of 15 i don't even remember how or why i started re-watching it and since that day i ve been hooked up to the story line. For those who don't like long anime, why are you even here? One piece is known to be the longest anime airing, please don't belittle the show because of that, there are plenty of other shorter anime to watch. So here starts my review! (took me long enough huh) The story is about a boy who aims find the legendary treasure One piece and become the pirate King. Why you may ask? For wealth, fame, power? NO! because he wants to be the freest man in the world. Personally, i don't want him to find it, because when that happens it will mean one piece has ended and am gonna cry my self to sleep that night. (pretty mature ain't i huh) The show starts a bit slow with the main character recruiting friends but for me i didn't even realize how the time (episodes) passed. The anime offers you both great comedy and action at the exact amount you d want it, with great jokes and funny faces as well as amazing fights that aren't only about getting stronger just from yelling that you love your friends. Furthermore, as the story progress, it becomes a bit more serious but without ever lacking of comical moments. What i love about it is, that the protagonist doesn't always win, making your adrenaline pump because you don't expect the same result every single time. To conclude, the plot surprised me many times, a minor detail you saw at around episode 60 ends up being very important at for example episode 300 and you stand watching it and wander ""was the author always planning to do this? how can he think so far ahead"" The characters, every character is unique they have their own goals and aren't simple side kicks for the plots sake. Every character has a deep background, it makes you feel that you know them better, you end up laughing with them, crying with them, feeling their agony (am i getting to cliche? ) And that doesn't only apply to the main crew but foes and allies alike. Off course there will be characters you like more and characters you wish they die but never actually do but that happens because of the big character variety it has i think it s normal one or two are not that likable (for example whiny princesses that need help) Also, the characters progress through the story even the air head protagonist gets more serious by the time you ve reached half of the series. So, i ve blabbered enough, if you like long series, amazing action, comedy, character development i think you should give One piece a try. P.S.

"This is the first anime I watched and alhtough I loved it at first, due to crappy animation and episodes consisting of %90 recap recently, Im really sad and giving this show an overall of 5. Almost all of the characters are loveable in One Piece. The story revolves around Luffy traveling from island to island as he makes new friends to find One Piece. This adventure is generally funny, sometimes sad, but enjoyable in overall. However, as I stated before, the crappy animation totally ruined this anime(at least last 200 episodes), but you can still read manga tough. If in future, some good animation company summarize the whole story to 200 epsiodes or so with great animation, this will be one of the best animes without doubt.

"One piece, one of the best shounen Manga out there. If you want a good shounen story, with a deep lore and good character, you will need to read the One piece manga. But, why READ? because the anime is an utter failure! Yeah there's some good scene but that will never justify how bad the rest of animation is. There's an episode where the recapping is 10 minutes long, and then nothing happen! Some of the animation even just is a still image with bad background voice acting. Maybe this is justified with so many episode out there and how they try to matching-up with the manga, but then, it just better to stop the show air then get back later with an actual good quality show.

One Piece has enabled me to experience a vast world of adventure, friendship, loyalty, and dreams. With the vast world that Eiichiro Oda has masterfully created, the grippling plots that surprise you when you least expect them, and the lovable characters, it's no wonder One Piece has been the highest selling manga for several consecutive years. With over 600 episodes to date, one may be intimidated to start the series. I agree, it may seem daunting AT FIRST. But trust me, once you start, you'll be unexpectedly marathoning all the episodes and end up wanting more. Give it a try.

"It was a long time since I didn't watch an anime , but in September 2014, I had some time and when I was young some friends were watching One Piece, but , I didn't care because I was a fanboy of Dragon Ball and I didn't really touched other animes either. One day, I just said why not ? Then I started watching , how do you say ? That one anime who made me fall in love with the Otaku world. This anime is so damn epic, the bromance between characters , all the epic scenes and of course , the smile of Luffy and his nakama who are each time living amazing adventures ( Not much details on that, discover by yourself like I did) This anime made me cried , made me smiled , made me laugh (when Luffy imitates Sanji lol) .

"One Piece is something which can not be explained by words, even though I will try my best to do it. Most people say One Piece get's better as you keep on watching the show, and I totally agree. But there is always a downside to the upside, newbies to the show. We ask all the time when does it get better? When does it get better? The truth is, if you don't like the first 100 episodes give up the show, got it? That's my perspective of this arguement against newbs and fans. Now, time for the actual review. Story: One Piece starts off very slow, when it comes to the storyline, but it improves as times go on. The story in One Piece can not be explained in 200 or even 300 episodes unlike some animes. The world is so complex and the story just adds to the world itself. Keep in mind that, One Piece does geniunly excell at story in later episodes, such as my personal favorite, Alabasta Arc! Art: One Piece is not known because of it's art style. In fact, I would call it mediocre. I don't personally favorite the art style, but it's better than some other animes I have watched. Sound: The soundtrack for this anime is very good. It provides decent OST's which makes the anime way more exciting and impressive. I want to say though that the soundtracks do get repetitive as time goes on. Each character also has their own music track apparently because of the mid-show cutscenes which depict the character, and their own music which is fun to guess for me. Character: I don't know how to stress this enough! The character's in this show are off the hook! The charcacter development stems way beyond any other anime or manga I have watched/read. You may become so attached to the characters, you might start hating the villians because you hope they won't sever that connection you have with those characters. Enjoyment: This anime get's a nine for enjoyment. I know what all of you fans are saying though, ""WTF!??"" and ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!??"" because One Piece deserves a 10. The only reason I put a 9 was because of the starting episodes, and other than that this definitely is pure awesomeness. This world is so enjoyable and so are the characters. In fact, I would say it's easy to get addicted to One Piece! The beginning episodes though, not so much! Some people might say though, that the story is slow-paced, so they don't like it, but the story must be slow-paced in order to explain this magnifecent world! Overall: One Piece is amazing in it's own ways, but does have flaws in it's own ways too. The pro's outnumber the con's though, but there are still a bunch of cons. This world truly is worth giving a try, but be warned if you don't like the first 100 episodes, just quit!

"""If I get reincarnated.... I wanna become a clam."" - Monkey D. Luffy"" I often see people pushing away and refusing to try One Piece because it's ""mainstream"" and very long. I am sad to see such a nice series being refused just because it's popular, it's long, the art, or because of the dubbed version. Story: With Pirates, superpowers, giants, and many more things, it is different from what I've seen in other anime. Sure, there are many other series about Pirates, or superpowers, but this combines everything into one long series. Sad moments that make you want to cry, some moments you cry of laughter, anxiously waiting for the next episode to see how everything plays out. Art: The art of One Piece has always been nice. It is bright and lively. Beautiful details, beautiful backgrounds, etc.. Sound: I am not one to overly enjoy the soundtrack on an anime, but One Piece was different. Each opening have been upbeat, refreshing, and nice to listen to. It was also nice when they doubled the beginning, and took the ending song out. The Japanese voice acting fits perfectly for each character you meet throughout the series. Character: You meet many, many characters in One Piece. Every one you meet, minor, major, enemies, friends, they all have their own style. Most characters will make an impact, and you will be remembering them a while after they leave. Enjoyment: I enjoy each and every episode, anticipating new episodes every Sunday. This show comes with lots of heart-warming moments, many surprises, and hilarious moments.

"One Piece is without a doubt the worst anime ever created. Its characters are obnoxious and simplistic, its art style is extremely hit or miss, its music is overbearing to the point of annoyance, it's just straight up sexist, and, worst of all, it is SLOW. PAINFULLY SLOW. UNWATCHABLY SLOW. First and foremost, let's take a look at the story and the characters. With the sheer amount of time put into introducing each member of the crew, establishing their backstories, and then forcing them into a wide array of situations, one might get the impression that One Piece is almost entirely character-driven. This expectation is pretty well established during the show's first arcs--the East Blue section, as we're introduced to the first members of the crew: Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Sanji--each of whom have varying backstories and personal scores to settle before they can become part of the straw hats. Arlong Park, which I would consider to be one of the worst arcs in anime history, really drives home this idea, that before we can get into the action, we have to dissect the stories of our protagonists, antagonists, and featured side characters. So why is Arlong Park so bad, and why do I consider One Piece's characters so utterly shallow? The first answer is that Luffy, largely because of his status as a self-insert for the audience, is often relegated to the sidelines for the sole purpose of not resolving the story too quickly. In Arlong Park, he does nothing, for no reason, for episode after episode, just to fight Arlong at the end. Even though it would have made much more logical sense for Luffy to fight Arlong sooner, the show needed to artificially suspend the action just to tell us about Nami's character via endless flashbacks. If Luffy wasn't just a tabula rasa, if he actually had a personality beyond wanting to eat food being intellectually stunted, this wouldn't be such a problem, but as an empty protagonist, he's relegated to being a plot device. The second answer is a combination of factors: the content of the cast's stories is often cliche and the characters themselves are archetypal, and the way in which that already poor content is delivered is slow and laborious. As I'll further elaborate on later in the review, One Piece is very filler-heavy. The same flashbacks are played sometimes multiple times per episode, only to be played yet again in the next episode on top of a separate recap. To once again use Arlong Park as an example, Nami's incredibly simplistic backstory, that she was a young girl forced into organized crime to help her family, is repeated ad nauseam while we wait for Luffy to waltz in and resolve everything when he finally feels like it. The content here is poor, its delivery is poor, and its pacing is bad. In the end, even after 14 episodes focused entirely on Nami and her past, we're left with little character development and a backstory so deep I already summed it up in less than a sentence. She joins the strawhats, but she remains a thief obsessed with money, just as she was before the arc began. Every main character can be summed up in the exact same way. We meet them, they display their singular character trait, they reveal to us via flashback a pivotal moment in their past that now defines their entire existence, the strawhats help them work towards their defining goal in life, they join the gang. All of this remains simplistic, poorly paced, and formulaic. Even over 300 episodes in, the exact same formula is at play, delivered in the exact same way. Moving on, let's talk about the art style. I've heard a lot of people call One Piece ugly or grotesque, and I strongly disagree. SOME of One Piece is ugly and grotesque, but only some of it. The main characters, minus Usopp, are aesthetically pleasing and thematically consistent in their depictions. Luffy especially is masterfully designed, the Strawhat logo is wonderful, and their first ship, the Going Merry, is quite nice. I think that the majority of One Piece's art problems lie in its inconsistency and its side characters. So many characters in One Piece look disturbing, grotesque, ugly, and frankly obnoxious. And while sometimes this makes sense for thematic consistency, often times the dissatisfying character designs get in the way of my enjoyment of the show. Why do random character look so freaky??? It's unsettling, and I wish that less characters were deep in the uncanny valley. Next up is the music. One Piece has a perfectly fine soundtrack on the face of it, but because it has specific themes for its characters, many arcs overuse tracks to an obnoxious degree. From what I remember, Chopper's introduction arc is what broke me. The same songs are played again and again with the same demented flashbacks. It felt like I was being Pavlov'd by the show runners. That's all I have to say about that. Here we are, at the juicy part of the review, the brain-dead sexism. There's a very well known meme online about how One Piece's female characters ""change"" over time, but assuming you aren't familiar, here's the deal: the main female characters, Robin and Nami, have their breasts increasingly enlarged over the show's runtime, to the point of absurdity. Although this is absolutely hilarious, it's also disgusting, depraved, and obnoxious. I need to know, who the fuck is watching this show for the sex appeal? There's also Sanji, the resident otaku of the group, and then Afro-skeleton, who are massive pervs and painfully unfunny. Their behavior isn't amusing, it's just gross, plain and simple. So how about we elaborate on something I've consistently brought up throughout the review: the pacing. After the show's initial start, every episode becomes ~50% recap. This isn't even a joke. There is one 20 min episode of One Piece for every 1 issue of manga, so the showrunners are forced to pad, and pad, and pad out the run time over and over again until the show reaches near unwatchable status. Now I know what you're saying: skip the recap parts. And while that is possible, it's annoying. Trying to binge watch One Piece feels like hours of just mashing my right arrow key, skipping the intro, the credits, the endless recaps and flashbacks and reused scenes. This might sound hyperbolic, but the reality of the situation is that it is PAINFULLY REAL. Even the most diehard fan could not watch One Piece without skipping through at least some of the filler. This goes hand in hand with the show's other problems to create a truly infuriating watching experience, where the characters go on demented rants recapping the same shallow backstories and events we heard in the last episode, and the episode before that, and before that, and so on. On top of that, the show's endless cast of side characters fill up a good 20% of the show's valuable remaining run time. And while I sometimes enjoyed time spent with them, I soon found myself waiting for all those side adventures to pay off, for the non-essential characters to reappear, for there to be any character development at all for either them, or our mains (other than just powering up), but that's the thing about One Piece, there is no development. All those side characters you were looking forward to checking back in with? They've just disappeared permanently after a pointlessly lengthy one-off introduction. One Piece is a lot like the controversial live action show LOST, except LOST had an ending. It didn't go on forever. In the end it answered its mysteries, it had conclusions, it had full character arcs. One Piece never ends. It's an endless stream of new characters the audience will never see again, their introduction and short lived examination acting as nothing but a substitution for any form of character development or main story progression. And even though I truly despise this show, what kept me watching were the small glimpses I got of greatness. The interesting arc premises, the overarching mystery, the lore and world building, these all genuinely interested me and kept me watching. But in the end, there isn't anything there. To get literally anything out of this show you have to voluntarily waste your time for hours upon hours, watching as nothing changes except Nami's cup size. I guess that brings me to one last point before the conclusion: THE MAIN STORY IS GOOD. I like the lore of One Piece, I like the pirates, I like most of the antagonists, and I like how the main characters just fuck around murdering cops and helping people out when they feel like it. But what I don't like is how rarely the arcs pay off, how unimportant the side characters are, how overwrought the flashbacks become, and how little was revealed about the main story in my over 340 episode watch time. The only conclusion I can realistically come to having watched so much of it is that this show is meant to waste your time. So why on earth is One Piece so highly rated? Two reasons: First, the initial couple of arcs are so bad that they generally put off anyone who might have mixed feelings about the show, weren't very interested to begin with, or were never going to be invested. The few people that do actually make it through the Arlong Park arc, i.e. the worst thing of all time, generally enjoy the show a lot more, as its almost all uphill from there. Second, sunk cost fallacy. As you watch more and more One Piece, a certain mentality begins to set in. You find yourself saying again and again, ""I've come this far, it'll get better"" ""Just one more episode, things'll pick up"" ""Just one more arc, and something will finally happen..."" And yet the more you watch, the more you realize nothing is ever going to change. That the small crumbs of story and meaning dropped every 20 episodes simply aren't enough anymore. And yet it's so hard to stop watching a show that you're hundreds of episodes into. That you've invested far too many hours in to just drop all of a sudden. It's the people that stick around, that become invested to the point of delusion, that simply can't escape anymore, who dominate the ratings online. Do yourself a favor, avoid this one.

"One Piece is a show that explores a futuristic version of humanity, it chooses to explore the ""Worst"" state of humanity's evolution. it's a really interesting concept, one that isn't explored as often as it's counterpart, as most futuristic shows lean more towards the optimistic side of things and all the accomplishments humans (can) achieve in the future. The show manages to have the most bleak, grim and tragic atmosphere i've ever seen. throughout this whole series, nothing good happens. or maybe the things that happen are good, but the way i interpret them is not good? the show explores multiple ideologies and beliefs and showcases how they clash together and at the end of the day, it doesn't try to sway you in one side or the other, it doesn't try to convince you ""this is a good guy"" and "" this is a bad guy"". it allows you to form your own opinions. it approaches fairly heavy topics like the meaning of life, faith, suffering, and what truly makes someone a human being. most of the ""explanations"" are delivered through the art and through showing you things and not explaining things in a clear way. the show has a fairly slow pace, which a lot of people do have a problem with but i personally found it to be really important for the latter parts to be meaningful. now to go into the more analytical ratings. Story: 10/10. The story in One Piece is quite fascinating to me, and it's portrayed in a way that i absolutely adore. While we do have a main character, Ichise. the story focuses on many different people at the same time, switching between their perspectives on the city, on life, and the world as a whole. most of the story is based around the city of lux, and it's apparent downfall into chaos. as mentioned before, the way the story is portrayed is slightly different than in other shows, as you may be used to having narration or some kind of monologue explaining the world to you, most of the time that is missing in One Piece. the show just throws you into the middle of everything and tries to slowly reveal things to you through it's symbolism and art. While One Piece can be described in many ways, such as it's a story about gang wars, or a story about a futuristic world gone wrong, etc. i'd say the most accurate description of One Piece is that it's a study of how humans feel towards being human, how they feel towards death, towards living, what really is the meaning of living? is there a point? is the series nihilistic or is it a story about hope? these are all questions you might be asking yourself while watching through this show. Characters: 10/10. I would say that the characters are what makes One Piece a masterpiece. to be able to present so many fundamentally different beliefs and opinions and still make the viewer not have a specific ""antagonist"" is quite amazing. every character has meaning, every character at the end of the day worked towards their beliefs and their ideals. The pain in this series feels real. the interactions feel real. The dialogue seems like something actual human beings would say to eachother. and the characters feel raw, their emotions are truly expressed in such a raw, unfiltered manner that you can't help but be attached to them or respect them even if you don't agree with how they view life. every character in this show had justifiable actions. all of them made sense. not a single time did i see something and think "" what the fuck this is just stupid"". it all just made sense. it genuinely just felt real. Art and sound: 10/10. while the story and characters are both wonderful and perfect. they wouldn't be enough without the way they were portrayed through the art and soundtrack, as many of One Piece's episodes have little dialogue, most of the series uses it's soundtrack and art to portray things that the dialogue doesn't. the art is honestly perfect. The color of this anime feels so fitting as it has a largely grey, bleak feel to it. never truly changing, always reminding you of how grim and hopeless this world is. the soundtrack reflects the same thing. most of the tracks are dark and further amplify the feeling of melancholy you can never shake off throughout this series, the voice acting didn't fail at any time throughout the series, i'd say ichise's voice acting stands out as again, the amount of agony portrayed in just the first and second episode was enough to convince me that the voice actor is doing a good job. the opening is incredibly good, the ending is relaxing. there's genuinely no complaints, except just ONE instance of a soundtrack being way too loud and kind of just terrible in the last episode. but that was only around 4 minutes of pain, and that would be petty to deduct a point for. Overall, I feel that i am not giving this series justice with my review because it's quite hard to express just how well it portrays human emotion. from the moment i saw the opening i knew that this was a show i'll give a 10. i went in with incredibly high expectations, and those were still surpassed. my only regret is how long it took me to actually watch this show, and actually ignoring it for so many years. but honestly. watching it now was not so bad, because it genuinely affected my views towards death and living. and made me view life in a different way. I absolutely love this show. and i highly recommend it to anyone that can stomach a rather painful story.",1,Not Recommended,"Aug 2, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5f51013034,13,5395
"Yes. Reading One Piece is a better experience, but there is still no better modern epic story told than One Piece. Read it, watch it, suck on it, lick on it, whatever. Its the greatest children's story, teen story, and adult story wrapped all-in-one. The episodic nature of the arcs makes it easy to binge in spurts. The art style changing throughout the story is subtle enough to be unnoticeable, until the time-skip. Which is jarring but still easy to digest. Luffy as a main character doesn't feel human, but everyone else around him does. He's almost jesus-like in nature but in a way thats not corny. Everyone can find something to like about One Piece due to its vastness, but I believe the culture behind it forces hate. Still there is a reason us fans are so obnoxious about it after all.",10,Recommended,"May 11, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_87b099db41,13,796
"Asking someone to watch 1,000+ episodes of a show is a hard ask, but One Piece definitely justifies it. Yes... the show is drawn out at points and some arcs could absolutely have been made more concise, but this is really a show about characters and plot first and foremost. Everything you experience when watching this show matters. The smallest details are called back hundreds of episodes later, and characters (even the minor ones) have properly fleshed out stories that make you feel attached to them. Everything connects, and the fact that the show is ongoing, even after all these years, makes the show intriguing even for newcomers because 'no one knows the conclusion', and therefore there are certain things that can't be spoiled even by long time watchers. There is absolutely some of the best character development in all of anime in the first few arcs of the show (the East Blue Saga) that sets the stage for later arcs while also creating an unbreakable bond between the viewer and the main cast. Once everyone is fully (or I should say mostly) developed, the plot and world-building really start to kick in. Prior to viewing, I would chastise One Piece for being so drawn out... I mean, if they can find the treasure in an hour-and-a-half in Pirates of the Caribbean, what the hell is taking Monkey D. Luffy so long??? But the one fact a friend told me that finally convinced me to watch One Piece, and one which you Reader might take to heart as well, is this: One Piece is not a show just about ""finding the treasure."" It is a show with incredible thought given to its characters and incredible care given to its world-building. If you are searching for a long-running show that you can really sink your teeth into, or just want a slow drip, shounen, experience, One Piece might just be the treasure you are looking for!",9,Recommended,"May 22, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e281fb5716,13,1837
"How can i start this? I write my personal experience about it. One Piece is an adventure of course it has 1000+ episodes. I remember the reason why i started this. I want another long anime like naruto so i can enjoy it for a long time. Man it was the best choice in my life. I relate Luffy really. I always was not a super extrovert person but i kinda felt like i am Luffy friend also who are with them on their Journey. What is full of laugh and sadness and joy. Its really like in the BInk's sake said ""Full of never-ending laughing tale"". I loved every arc of it. I love how Oda art style changes in time. And not i dont care if the villain or regular character design is goofy its just the show itself. Luffy is goofy but serious and we feel this atmosphere through the whole show. One Piece has amazing fights soundtrack and so okay its powerscaleing under planetary level but who cares? Better writings in a side villain what you dont see ever than any mainstream anime main character nowadays. And boy the story full of mysteries. I hope i will see the end of it.

"In a vast ocean of anime, few manage to capture the pure essence of adventure like One Piece. From its thrilling beginning to its most recent arcs, the series continues to captivate me with its incomparable sense of exploring unknown islands, facing imminent dangers, and forging bonds as strong as steel among crewmates. The sense of adventure in One Piece is really immersive. The Straw Hat Pirates' journey through the Grand Line is an emotional rollercoaster, full of highs and lows, yet always keeping the flame of adventure alive. From the imposing Grand Line to the exotic and surreal islands, the world of One Piece is vast and diverse. One of the most captivating aspects of One Piece is the sense of belonging to the Straw Hat crew ( we really do feel like a ""nakama""), known for their indomitable bond of camaraderie. The element of mystery is skillfully implemented throughout One Piece's narrative, keeping viewers eager for more with each twist and turn. From the enigmatic Poneglyphs to the secrets of the World Government and the true story behind the legendary One Piece, the anime maintains a veil of secrecy that keeps fans speculating and theorizing endlessly. However, despite all these positives, I cannot ignore the main point of criticism: the slow pacing of the anime, especially in the more recent arcs. While the careful world-building and character development are admirable, there are moments when the pacing feels sluggish, testing the patience of even the most dedicated fans. This is undoubtedly the only reason why I don't rate One Piece a perfect rating of 10/10.",9,Recommended,"Mar 26, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_169e7c9718,13,1597
First of all the One Piece anime is based on a manga. It's manga is the most popular manga of all times becouse of the drawing but most importantly becouse of the story. So the anime has the same amazing story. This anime has a lot of different characters. And yes.. Every character is different. The basic idea of the anime about Pirates is amazing becouse a pirate needs to be strong. At this point comes in the fact that the main characters are evolving themselves all the time.

"(This review applies to both the manga and anime. Anime-only stuff like animation and music are not accounted for.) Short version: One Piece is not for me. I can see why people love it. If you love OP, good. That means you found something worthwhile that I couldn’t. Don’t let my opinion interfere with your enjoyment. My not being a fan of OP is not a personal attack against you. You do you. I am only writing this to elaborate to fans why some of us remain skeptical of OP, even after giving it a go. Long version: Shounen action. Battle Shounen. Or just plain “Shounen” to many Western anime fans. Whatever you call it, fantastical action-adventure series originating from comic magazines for young males (shounen manga) is by far the most popular genre of Japanese popular culture in the West. For most Westerners, shounen action is all that anime is. Outside of Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Death Note (the last of which being from Shounen Jump, LOL), about 90 percent of anime fans I know IRL only, only, ONLY watch/read shounen action properties. And this isn’t just kids; people my age and those middle-aged also only, only, ONLY watch/read shounen action series. Every now and again, you might find someone who’s watched Spirited Away, but it cannot be overstated just how everywhere shounen action is. A lot of anime shows I’ve heard described as “Popular”, such as Haruhi Suzumiya, Re:Zero, Gurren Lagann, Angel Beats, Hellsing and Madoka Magica, may as well not exist to most anime fans I know in person. For SOME anime fans, this is a bad thing. To certain members of “geek” culture, it is a sin to say “OMG! I. Love. Anime. So. MUUUUCH!” And to only, only, ONLY watch DBZ and Naruto. I am not one of those people. There are some shounen action properties I love. Remember my old review of Fullmetal Alchemist? That’s one example right there. However, if you were to ask me of a long-running action series to recommend, One Piece is not one of them. OP is a shounen action series from Weekly Shounen Jump. It needs no introduction. It being the best-selling manga/graphic novel series of all time should make that evident enough. It’s a manga that has remained in production since 1997, with an anime that has remained in production since 1999. It is a phenomenon. It’s more popular in some countries than others, but anyone even vaguely knowledgeable of anime has at least heard of OP. This is a tale of pirates, those who choose not to bind themselves to the rule of law, explorers, con artists, scalawags, warriors of virtue, cooks, and other assorted individuals. It’s a world where everyone is trying to claim the greatest treasure buried by the greatest pirate of all time. OP follows Luffy, the leader of the Straw Hat Pirates, a wandering troupe of lost souls out to find the One Piece. OP’s author, Eiichiro Oda, designed the series to be the sort of manga he would’ve wanted to read as a kid. You can certainly see a lot of imagination behind it. My quick summary makes it sound intriguing. You can see why there are legions of fans. There are also legions of people who gave up on OP like me. There are legions who will never try it out. I’m not alone. I got friends with zero interest in OP. And I have not one, but two friends who dropped OP like me. Our reasons slightly differ, but they all stem from the same issue of the fact that OP never ends. The story of OP has run longer than the Fate franchise. It’s lightyears longer than anything Tolkien ever put out. The tax codes for the state of California are a brief afterthought compared to OP. I found a YouTube video that attempted to summarize all of OP. It was 6 hours long! 6! Now, does being long necessarily mean it’s not good? Of course not. My Hero Academia is over a hundred episodes in length, and it’s the best quote-on-quote “shounen” I’ve seen since FMA Brotherhood. The problem is OP doesn’t really do a whole lot with its infinite length. Something I’ve learned throughout my life is memory tends to remember the most impactful moments. As you age, you forget things and moments that weren’t majorly impactful. This is a blessing and a curse, for while your most cherished memories will stay beside you, your most painful memories will, too. I brought up the concept of memory because, One Piece, for all the content it has, didn’t leave much impact on my memory. It doesn’t really do much to differentiate itself from similar series. Progress, if you can call it that, is borderline non-existent. I can’t remember any great lesson the show gave out, no scene that really stood out in my mind. All I remember are character flashbacks and outlandish fight scenes. Speaking of memories, do you remember my review of Cowboy Bebop? I caught a LOT of flak for that back in the day, because I “only” gave it a 6, and didn’t fill my review with words like, “hype” “GOAT” “timeless” and “iconic.” Despite my many issues with CB, I still found it more enjoyable than OP. Let me repeat that, even though I found about 80 percent of CB cliched and aimless, I would still take that, warts and all, over OP any day. At least CB had the courtesy to end, the courtesy to at least let stuff happen in its runtime, stuff that shifted the status quo. Now that I’ve brought up OP’s lack of narrative progress, allow me to describe a typical scenario, just to give you an idea of its status quo. The Straw Hats arrive at a new island. The island’s citizens are being terrorized by a pirate/corrupt official/some other sort of villain. The Straw Hats fight this villain. They win. They leave the island, only to end up doing the same thing on a different island over and over. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. They come, they fight, they leave. Now do you understand why I, of all people, wanna watch CB again? My first friend who gave up on OP, lasting for at least a few hundred episodes, much longer than me, dropped OP for this reason, the fact that this, like some other shounen action series, becomes nonstop fighting. Too much fighting, not enough anything else. This is not to say you can’t EVER have tons of battles. Perhaps the series could do a commentary on the constant pirate warfare going on: does the nonstop violence eventually exact a toll on the psyches of the Straw Hats? Is the series saying something about a society that solves ALL its problems through combat? No and no. You’re not getting anything like that. OP is not a work of fiction, but more a series of wrestling matches done in a fantastical manner. Beyond a few character backstories and a few memorable (if simplistic) villains, there is no meaning beyond the video game levels of metahuman fighting. Watching Luffy win battle after battle is no different from watching a pro Street Fighter player level opponent after opponent. Might be exciting the first few times, but there’s nothing offered beyond that. It was my friend’s reason for giving up, and it was one of my reasons, too. My other friend who dropped OP, lasting about 500 or so episodes, was also because of the fighting, but not the nonstop nature of it. Rather, they lost interest because OP commits another common sin of shounen action; the fights and power system become too crazy. It’s the same reason I don’t watch the later parts of JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and one reason I dropped Naruto and Bleach back in the day. Now, I only saw the first 40 or so episodes. The action scenes didn’t have this problem, and in fact, it was kind of fun to see the Straw Hats use their unique talents to win. Nonetheless, I did do some research on the Fandom page for OP (never a good sign when I don’t care for spoilers when writing about something) and can confirm the following: If you thought Dragon Ball Super’s power system was convoluted, then don’t read or watch the later portions of OP! It reminds me of a quote from a movie I saw as a kid, “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should.” (5 sequels, and none of them rival the original Jurassic Park.) To its credit, OP doesn’t start off a victim of power creep, but it eventually falls into that trap, should you attempt to marathon the series. Another knock is the characterization. It’s nothing special. Luffy is the sort to fight first, ask questions never. Sanji loves to hit on women. Nami is greedy. Usopp is a coward, except when the chips are down. Surface level stuff. With that said, there was one Straw Hat I liked, Zorro. Maybe it’s just because he lives by a code similar to the samurai, but I found his backstory and his code of honor intriguing. Beyond that, he’s largely just a macho warrior who can fight with three swords, but he stood out for me. The other standout was the villains. Being a children’s franchise, the villains are very obviously evil, but that’s part of OP’s appeal, to not only see grandiose examples of diabolical lowlifes, but to also see the heroes knock the villains down a peg. Since I didn’t get very far in the show, I don’t know any of the other major characters. Not great, but could be worse. I give this franchise a 5 because while I don’t like OP, I don’t despise it. It’s not pro-fascist and cynically manipulative like Mahouka. It’s not annoying and insultingly stupid like Kill La Kill. It’s not chock full of contrivances like Code Geass. It’s not offensive like a good number of American sitcoms. It’s not amateurish like RWBY. Its attempts at humor aren’t as painfully unfunny as Slayers’ attempts at humor. It’s not overly random like Fooly Cooly. One Piece excels by not committing some of the biggest mistakes of some of its contemporaries. But ask yourself, in a world where Fullmetal Alchemist, My Hero Academia and Re:Zero exist and can be watched for free online, is “not being insultingly stupid” good enough? Oh yeah, almost forgot, the artwork. I feel the same way about the art. I neither like nor dislike it. Many people have avoided OP because of the art. I should criticize them for being shallow, but they are lucky. OP’s art is cartoony, yes. Everyone has the same sort of smile with the massive teeth. Again, it excels when compared to the moeblobs of recent light novels adaptations, but I also find it rather simplistic when compared to many other shounen action series. I will point out that I spared myself the embarrassment of the female designs post-timeskip since I dropped OP so early. This might just be the grounded realist in me, but I don’t find female character designs that are 100% bust curvature and 0% everything else to be particularly charming. Sad to see it shares a flaw with Bleach in this regard. So to hardcore fans of OP, like I said in the start, you keep doing you. I just wanted to tell you that some of us tried. Some of us tried for hundreds of episodes and chapters. Some of us tried for years. I tried for about 40 episodes, alternating between sub and dub. But the simple truth is, nothing is universal. Some people don’t like shounen action in general. Some like me prefer the shounen denomination known as The First Church of Deku. Some people simply can’t commit to a single work of art that has taken nearly 30 years to complete with no apparent end in sight. For some people, that is a strength. For others, it’s too much. Whatever the case, I think we can all agree that it’s remarkable that OP has run for as long as it has. I do respect Oda and Toei for being able to maintain one series this long, because to do so is nothing short of Herculean. Nonetheless, one person’s trash is another person’s buried treasure, and while OP has its strengths, I can’t call myself a fan.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 27, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b1b11b1781,13,11699

It's the characters!

"Let me say this right now: One Piece will forever be my favorite series. I have faith that Eiichiro Oda will continue to write with the amazing skill that he has and will not let it falter like the writers of Naruto and Bleach did toward the end. But but BUT there's two big reasons that I say series rather than anime. In truth, I follow the manga far more closely than the anime itself. There are two reasons for this: the filler and the animation budget. As a long time One Piece fan, I'm sure that many of you understand what I'm referring to. But to those who are jumping into the series this late (good luck binge watching that, kids) I shall explain the faults of the anime. Let's start off with the big one: animation. Now, when I say animation I'm not talking about art style. I think Oda's art style is unique and he delivers it very well. No, I'm referring to the amount of crappy stills put into a fight scene. The amount of quality that fails as the series progressed. Up until the Whitebeard War arc (which you could say is currently the halfway point of the series) the animation had its own charm. It wasn't overly flashy but it certainly got the job done and both the fight scenes and the relaxed scenes looked fairly decent. But once the New World hit, something happened to the budget of the animation, as many of the scenes lacked a lot of detail and its disheartening to see. Now, recently, the animation has started to hike back up. I don't know how long this will last or if it will be just for these few scenes in between the big climax, but time will tell on that. Onto the second problem: the filler. Now, unlike Naruto and Bleach, One Piece's filler isn't done through seasons of standalone arcs. There's only a few of those throughout the series and generally don't last that long in the first place. The filler, much like the animation slope, came later in the series, and worked its way in between episodes. What Toei does is instead of making arcs to distance themselves from catching up to the manga or just taking a few months break, they instead will expand on one scene very terribly and ruin the flow that Oda put forward. Something that lasted one or two panels in the manga will last close to ten minutes in the anime. This might not be such a problem if Toei didn't make the expanded scenes so ugly looking or interesting. Instead you can just feel the laziness of the scene. With those complaints out of the way, lets get into the good stuff: everything else. The story of One Piece is fairly simplistic in nature as its usually just following Luffy and crew from one island to another, usually involving Luffy saving said island from some evil mastermind. Now this might seem like some rinse and repeat idea, but what Oda does to make each arc different is simple: He makes each island have its own genuine feel. In the East Blue arc, all of the islands are generally identical, but there's a reason for that: East Blue is the weakest sea on the planet. Its meant to a more relaxed adventure with more personal problems than outside problems. Once you get to the Grand Line, each island starts to pick up in scale. First big arc is Alabasta, a literal gigantic desert island under the influence of a Warlord. Next is an island in the sky that the crew shoots themselves up to. After that, an island that's' like a giant water utopia, and so on. Each island has its own unique aesthetic as well as a unique set of problems. Each arc feels well crafted and is able to stand on its own two feet in quality. Next up, the characters. I think this is the biggest thing for a lot of fans because its definitely one of my biggest things about One Piece: I LOVE the main cast. Monkey D. Luffy is a fairly simple character as he's an idiot with a lot of strength and a big dream he's constantly chasing. Sounds pretty familiar, right? Well, Luffy as well as many of the other crew members have plenty of unique things going for them. For one, Luffy isn't a fight crazed protagonist who's constantly seeking a bigger challenge, even if he's constantly picking fights with the big names of the world. Believe it or not, he'd rather go on adventures than fight, even if he does enjoy it to a degree. Not to mention he's aware of his own faults, having assembled a crew that can act in ways that he can't. Another thing about characters in One Piece is that, somehow some way, Oda does not let any of the named ones go to waste. Somebody who seemed to only have a bit part in the past or seemed insignificant before is very likely to come back up again and have a larger role in the scale of things. The thing about it is, Oda knows how to make even subvillains seem sympathetic if he wants. In the previous arc, a very small time bit villain has a flashback during his fight with one of the crew and it ends up making you feel bad for him. To be honest, I was shocked how much I ended up liking him. His design is so dumb but the design has a reason behind it and you end up thinking 'wow, that's actually cool of him'. Seriously, if anything is the highlight of this series, I'd say its the character moments. On to the music and sound, the music is pretty on point. It's not the greatest anime OST ever created but it certainly gets the job done. When the series wants you to feel hyped up, its got the track for you. When its got a scene that is sad, you know it's about to play the perfect mood setter. The only complaint I might have about the sound is the eye catchers that pop up when you can tell its switching to commercial. Sometimes those can get annoying and ruin the mood of a scene especially if things are getting intense or sullen. Other than that, the OST is good. As for the voices, I'd say generally the voices fit each of their roles perfectly. I remember when I first watched One Piece subbed, I thought 'what the hell is up with Luffy's voice??' but as I continued to watch the series, I realized that the VA for Luffy is incredible. Her emotional content and strength of voice is amazing. Not to mention she's actually in her 70's. You have to admire that kind of skill in a VA. When Luffy's going to make a big exclamation, she's right on it. When Luffy's in pain or suffering, she can put that out like nothing. Don't disregard the Japanese VA just because the voice seems childish, she does a fantastic job as Luffy. The same goes for the rest of the crew, but Luffy's VA stands out for me the most. Well, I believe that about wraps up my review. Overall, while I do prefer the manga to the anime due to the reasons above, there's plenty to love in the anime regardless of that. There's a reason that this series has survived so long and has ruled as the king of Shounen since its arrival. If you don't mind the length and time required to be put in, I highly recommend this series.",9,Recommended,"Feb 21, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_79396146d8,20,6836
"A very good anime, with one of the best character constructions, AWESOME fights and bringing cool messages. The soundtrack combines well with the atmosphere of freedom of the anime, the ""abstract"" art makes the anime express itself better, very funny, character INCREDIBLY well worked and with sad/exciting moments that do u never stop crying... After the *** S *** (I censored to haven't spoilers ) it changed a little, but it was purposely. Oda give a shock of reality in the characters and, mainly, in the fans that... is not spoilers, right?

"One piece is my favorite manga. Probably the one I've been for the longest time. I started animated when I was a kid, I was 9 years old. I was watching with my mother and sister, we were having a good time, until I was 11~12 years old. I stopped the anime for a year or two, and continued it until episodes 700 where I read the manga. Well, no big differences, but I liked reading manga. Then I wanted to continue following the animated despite everything, but.... I was bored. I stopped following the anime, but looked at it again later and once the nostalgia was set aside, the animated adaptation was an insult to the manga. I recognize that Oda has the ability to stretch some bows / pass through the manga, except that unlike the Toei he does it well. So yes, the Japanese dubbing is good, the ost too, there are very well adapted scenes, especially the moving scenes. But the animation, the slowness of the episodes, it kills One Piece. Toei, how can you adapt a 14-page chapter in 20 minutes? It's impossible without stretching as unnecessarily as you do. Who would it kill to make One Piece an animated in season, like all those currently out there? Who would spit on waiting to have a better adaptation than the current one? No one! No one! So to sum up, the main flaw of the One Piece animation is its awful slowness, the animation.... Worse than average.... In fact, it's basically the manga with more squares for the same shot, to which we add sound and voice. That's the principle of an animate, it's true, but this time it's not done right. The Wa no series is better, but let's not hide our faces except for a big change of style and an improvement of the animation, there is always this frightening slowness that is omnipresent. It's a little higher than the average, but it doesn't save everything. To be exact, I gave up when Urashima and Luffy gave each other their one-minute palm punch.

"One Piece One Piece is a Manga series produced by Eiichiro Oda. Before he produced One Piece he had already produced several series including ""Wanted"" and ""Monsters and Romance Dawn"". The series follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy whose body gets the properties of rubber after eating one of the many devils fruits (which are fruits that give certain powers) that prevent him from swimming. With his crew called Straw Hat pirates. One Piece is by far the best anime I have seen. But not everyone shares the same opinion as me, let's fix that, shall we? The story of One Piece usually consists of the Straw Hat Pirates who travel from island to island and experience crazy adventures. Although every crew member has a different reason for this, they all share the same goal: reaching the end of the treacherous Grand Line. The style of One Piece is one of the elements that brings many people to the series. The style is quite old like Dragonball Z. Anyway, the quality of the animation improves steadily as the show moves. The show is now broadcast in HD. I absolutely love the music of One Piece. There are so many different types of situations in One Piece: happy, sad, happy, scared, epic, intense, and so on. For each of these situations there is a unique piece of music that plays in the background. What's more is that each character has his own style of music? Unlike the majority, I find the animation creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately, people see it as something or a twist and One Piece quickly assesses something infantile. An anime does not have to be complex to be good enough. It can be anything, as long as it provides satisfaction. And One Piece does that.",9,Recommended,"May 9, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d9f419c837,20,1732
"One Piece is honestly the best show I’ve ever watched in my entire life. What Oda, the creator of OP, gave us, was more than just a story - he gave us an entire world, filled with unique people with their own backstories. It takes the time to tell us about the different characters Luffy meets along the way, and all of their stories are somehow interconnected, whether it’s tragic or happy or strange or mysterious. It really puts everything in perspective, y’know? That everyone on planet earth has their own story and there’s no end to it. It takes the time to show how its multidimensional characters grow, change, and how it affects the world. Or how it doesn’t affect the world. Like that dog back in Orange Town, who was just trying to protect his late master’s house… tons of instances like that is why I love One Piece. It’ll make you cry, laugh, smile, squeal in excitement, and just be in awe of how well put-together the world of One Piece is. It’s not just all about the characters, though. The overarching plot of One Piece is amazing, as well. In the world ruled by a corrupt government and pirates constantly battling for power, there’s always something new to see, and always something else to affect the plot. The essence of a plot is that it’s formed by hundred and hundreds of character decisions, and you begin to understand the story as you see said decisions being made. You’re shown all of the main character’s goals, and why. You’re shown why villains do what they do, and sometimes you even feel bad for them - like Arlong or Hody Jones, who grew up in hatred of humans from what they’d done to Fishman Island. You’re shown all of the evil of the world, and how it’s always going to be there, and that makes the world of OP that more realistic. You’re shown all of the good of the world, and how some even die in the name of justice, and how some even used to be villains. Everything you see in One Piece just… makes sense. It’s all interwoven - the characters, the backstories, the plot, everything. The wonderful world building, the incredible cast of rich, relatable characters, and the plot that makes you just ache to see the next episode makes watching One Piece through all the way worth it. I will say, this show wasn’t even in my top ten until around episode 100, and not in the top three until around three hundred. The first 20 or so episodes felt like a drag. Many are turned off by One Piece’s art, and others dislike the slow pace. I wasn’t too fond of either at first. Now, I believe One Piece is the best show - no, the best story in general to ever exist. If you haven’t watched One Piece, watch it.

"One Piece will be the kind of show that you are thankful to have continued watching. Like starting Madoka Magica, or Clannad or heck even Game of Thrones, it's something that only gets better and better. Unlike Bleach or Fairy Tail and Naruto, the first few episode doesn't immediately show-off an epic fight or get your pity--OP is pretty chill in the beginning. Take Anohana for example: in Anohana, the first 11 episodes were slow, but they were buildup for that last episode--the awesome last ep that squeezed your heart and tear-ducts dry. For One Piece, the story really starts rolling until they get five crew members, which is like 50 eps in. After that, 700 episodes of awesomeness awaits you. The core of the show is about wonder--Luffy wants to be the Pirate King because he believes that the Pirate King is the freest person in the World. He is a Pirate by his own standards, not killing or pillaging, and instead helping people with his life on the life cuz he freaking wants to. But there is so much more to this show--it's silly, it's light-hearted, it's dumb fun to watch all the adventures he and his crew go through. But still, some scenes are packed with much more meaning and personal stakes that makes it difficult to turn away. As much as I love One Piece, I recommend to stop watching the anime and switch to the manga when you get to the Dressrosa Arc. This is where the anime suffered due to stretching out the anime to converting one chapter per episode--diluting the tension of the show to zero. (Golden rule of anime is to convert two chapters of manga per animated episode). (You know, so the show wouldn't catch up to where the manga currently is and suffer the same problem as AOT/SNK and have to stop for 4 years). The Manga has fantastic pacing, it's only any of the adaptations, be it dub or sub, 4Kids or Toei that change the story. Become part of the OP fam.

"This is my first review of anything ever and it's fitting that it goes to one of my all-time favourite things ever. One Piece is what got me into the manga and anime community, by now everyone has heard about its great world building and I'm not going to go into that because there are better and more informative reviews for that. I just want to say as a massive one piece fan who is all caught up with the manga is that every anime and manga fan should watch or read one piece, it deserves all the hype it gets. Now I know that this review is not at all organized but, there is one fault that I think sticks out. In my opinion, Oda writes all the backstories of the characters from the same template. It could be his style or it could be that he just hasn't realised but all the characters follow the same pattern - as a child, the character went through some trauma and now that trauma affects the said character in some way which defines their worldview.",9,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7b049e6adb,20,958
"Ultimately, what you have to accept when you're considering watching a show like one piece is that it's over 800 episodes long, and still not over. This is a daunting task even for the most skilled of bingers. As much as I love this show, there are somethings I feel that I need to inform you of before I can honestly recommend One Piece to anyone. There are two very distinct parts of One Piece, and that is a result of the 2yr time-skip that occurs. For the portion of the anime up until the time-skip I would recommend watching every episode (including filler). Practically all of the early filler episodes utilize one piece's comedy and characters to their fullest, and the fillers don't feel like filler; these fillers feels very in-line with the source material. However, after the time-skip this changes, and the fillers become wastes of time. Additionally, you'll want to instantly skip the first 4-5 minutes of every episode in the post time-skip section as that is simply the opening + 3 or 4 minutes of re-cap. If you do get up-to-date, you will notice a few instances of lack-luster animation, however, this is true of any anime that runs on weekly releases. Luckily, the scenes that really matter still seem to be getting the attention they deserve. One Piece's biggest problem is that they have purposely slowed the pacing of the anime to give the manga more time. The best solution if you dislike the pacing, but wish to keep enjoying the story, is to simply read the manga. Ultimately, I can't end a review on one of my favorites on a bad note, so I will end it with this. One Piece's greatest strength is that it's about how its protagonist (Luffy) changes the world. This is unique to many other stories which are generally focused upon how the world or other factors change the protagonist, and is one of the reasons why One Piece is able to continue a connected story over hundreds of episodes.",10,Recommended,"May 8, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9b0a00b5f6,20,1914
"In my humble opinion the anime ended at episode 500. After this episode the amount of fan service and making episode unnecessarily longer is annyoing. The boob balance has placed this anime on a cringe spectrum for me, every time i try to watch it and i see those enomourse milk bags i just can't take it but laught at how bad this anime has gotten and how poor of taste the creators are. I was with this anime for many years, yet i can't take it. (I have stopped watching several years ago on episode 800). I hope someday we will see a decent re-work of this. That wont include so many milk bags and make episodes speak a story and not just try to stretch it. The story over all is great its slow it has good pacing yet again untill episode 500 or maybe a little later, it gets worse, a lot worse. I would rather see this anime take a break than make such episodes that you can essentially watch in like 10 minutes yet they have a 25 minute watch time. Art style is amazing even with older technology and way of drawing it still holds up to this day. After introducing the new art style after episode 500 its just not the same it feels like some echii or hentai show this is not why i came here. Music, i dont think i have any kind of bad music expierience with this anime so at least this stayed on its high level. Characters they all feel unique, have often unique powers and souls. They have their past that is often explained and shown to viewer that is a very nice way of showing a character if done correctly. You learn a lot about characters and you care about their stories that are more often than not intresting and have plot connections. Enjoyement was a 10 untill episode 500. After that it felt to 0 it just feels so forced to watch this art style and overly long episodes that speak about nothing yet take so much of your time. Overall i would give it a 4/10 for just bcuz the 1st 500 episodes are a masterpiece, yet later its all abandonend for some coomers and fan service.

"Action, adventure, comedy-- If you're looking for the perfect mix of epic action and dramatic, tear-jerking scenes, well my friend, One Piece is for you. I think in order to watch One Piece, you've gotta throw away any of your first opinions, because the thing that threw me off at first was the art style, as well as the ""overwhelming"" number of episodes. So disregard those right now, or else you'll miss out on something huge. And stay committed! The overall character development is sure to cause some tears at some point. Watching (or reading) the powerful backstories of the characters, as well as the inspirational effort shown as they overcame them is truly remarkable. Something many anime have, and always will, have a struggle with, and Oda pulled it off for nine characters, all equally amazing. Along with the development, the emotions triggered while watching this anime are unstoppable. Be prepared for tears at some point-- grab your tissues. The way the story is presented, you're bound to feel a pang in your chest, or tear up. The message portrayed in this fun, upbeat anime is also something outstanding. In every episode, One Piece never fails to inspire you, as the characters all chase down their dreams. ""Follow your dreams, and don't let anyone prove you wrong.""

"Lemme say this first, I watched over 100 anime, almost all the main streams and out of all them I gotta say that this right here, One Piece, it the greatest I have watched by far. Here's the review Story - The author really knows what hes doing. The main character Luffy, is a rubber human after eating the gomu gomu no mi. His goal is to become the Pirate King so he sails out of his small home village to pursue his dream meeting many people on the way, some that become his friends, and some that join his crew. Luffy although stupid, he knows how to tell you everything with just his fist. I don't how the author did it, but the way he makes luffy express certain things in few words and simple actions. Although he is an idiot, hes a genius in the way he is. His entire crew all join with a similar goal in life all linked to luffy's may it be to sail the whole world, make a map of the whole world, or discover what hasn't been discovered. Another thing they do great in this anime is foreshadowing, things from the first few episodes can come around again 500 episodes later. They explain a lot of things, and when you forget about them they bring it back. They constantly hint at the Will of D, Luffy's father, Luffy's brother, as well as what one piece REALLY is, and how everyone is connected to it. This is the only anime that can make me shed tears over and over.600 episodes out and it still hasn't gotten dull, virtually no fillers, and still a bunch of story left to be told. It's a huge world with different species, races, discoveries. Art - the Art is not the best, it's a unique style and many people hate on it. Unlike a majority of anime that fail to realize that there are many different looking people in the world, and in the world of one piece there are even more different looking people, ugly, deformed, strange, attractive, large, small, they are all drawn in their own way. The author is an artist and can draw bleach like drawing but doesn't, its not like he cant. What I really like about this drawing is the way it can express emotion. If you look at luffy angry, you feel it, you feel the intensity of his angry, its like you wanna punch your screen just as hard you wanna punch the villain in the face. Sound - The music is good, very pirate like if i were to describe it. Each crew member have their own theme song that match their personality well. They know how to make situations sound good using the music. Characters - Well developed, all though they look like a happy bunch now but each member has their own dark past, all of them been through a lot and almost all of the back stories will stab you in the heart and make you cry for them. It's because of their past that they have such a respect for luffy, the one that understands them and can bring out their good sides as well as vanquish their bad. Enjoyment - Very enjoyable, being a beautifully made comedy and action anime it can make you feel the intensity of battle while also making you laugh. It has a lot of drama and sad stories so it's not always all laughs. Overall - 9/10 The beginning is bad and childish but as the audience got older so does the content, you have to tolerate the first few episodes, they are just introductions, it gets way better.

"I'm fairly new to One Piece; can't say I carry over that nostalgic feel, but that doesn't mean I don't love it. One piece's story is wonderful. It's such a broad idea and can always stay on the main story. There is rarely ever any fillers which is great. The fight scenes are awesome too. There's always tension in them, leaving you at the edge of your seat. So far (as of episode 351) I hate how no one will die. Everyone seems to live by some wonder or just lives in general despite being hit by something like a bomb millions of times. It's nothing I can't deal with of course, and I've heard it changes later on so I'm anticipating it. Personally One Piece is one of my favorites too. I highly recommend this.

"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime I've watched. The characters and story are amazing and the manga is probably one of my favorites but wow. STORY The story started with an epic entrance. I've never seen a character enter the scene like that. At first he made people think that Coby was the main character because he was so focused on him, but once Coby discovered a barrel, Luffy suddenly came out of it while shouting “that was a nice nap! ,” I was blown away because it was hilarious, but a brilliant way for a character to make an appearance. At first, I thought it might just be a simple adventure, but it managed to capture my attention because different islands had different uniqueness! ]CHARACTERS Each character is unique, no two characters are the same. The distribution is so big and continues to grow. Strawhat is a big family and they make me feel like I'm part of their family too. The team meets a bunch of characters, which are again - unique. I think One piece has the richest cast of characters of any anime I've watched, heard of, or will watch in the future. And again almost all of them have played or will play a big or small role in the series. ANIMATION Toei is famous for handling the One piece anime. Poor pacing and dragging an episode to the point of absurdity. But they have definitely settled down over the years. At least they did justice to this story and continue to progress episode after episode, and lately their work in Wano (Most recent arc at the time of writing this review) has been phenomenal. SOUNDTRACK Great sound effects displayed throughout the series, it even has its own songs (eg ""Bink's sake"", a really great one) and great sound effects.

I believe people can find it enjoying to watch when they just want to disconnect sometimes but there is nothing in this show which makes it deserve a 8.3 in rating. I can explain 1 of many scenes why i find this too silly and the fights boring. There is one fight in the early episodes when they fight a clown pirate ""Buggy"". A cannon gets loaded, Zoro flips it so it is pointed towards the pirates (they are like 2 meter away). For 5 seconds they just stand there like in old cartoons, not moving and then gets shot.

"Let me be clear here, I'm giving a 5/10 not to the series overall, but rather to strictly the anime. I'm dropping the anime at episode 767 and switching to the manga, never to go back. The overall series (manga) is a 9/10 to me still. Anyways, to the review: I think that we can all agree that bad adaptations suck. They make a legendary series seem like garbage due to poor translation from one medium to another. There are many issues, but one of the most common seems to be pacing. Mainly, fast pacing. It's just not feasible to fit a 100 chapters of content into a single 12 episode season. It's not possible! Story gets zoomed past episode by episode, and you're left with an extremely rushed show, since the anime covers so much content in so little time. However, of course, the original manga/LN is brilliantly paced, and had no issues of rushing. Nonetheless, the people who watch only the show think: ""Damn, this show sucks."" And rightfully so. Why was it so poorly adapted? One piece has the exact opposite problem. Holy crap, this show wants to milk out as many episodes as humanly possible. A page worth of content gets stretched to 5-10 minutes of runtime in the anime. It's ridiculous how slow paced the anime is compared to the manga. Of course, I know the reason. The anime caught up, and can only adapt a chapter at a time for each episode. That being said, have the producers ever thought of taking a break before creating some quality content? NO! One episode a week, every week, every year, no breaks. It's such a shame. Like I said earlier, it's only in the more recent years since this problem rose, since the anime wasn't always on the heels of the manga, probably at around pre time skip era. When you watch the old episodes, they aged great. The pacing is amazing, fights are more expressive, no watermelon boobs, there's actually blood when there needs to be, and there's a distinct animation style that can't be seen anymore in the ""modern"" One Piece. Alright, so pacing kind of sucks in the post time skip episodes. Do the benefits of the anime adaption make it worth it to slog over one chapter per episode? No, unfortunately. Voice acting is 10/10, but everything else is trash. OST is actually very nice, but a lot of the same ones get played over and over again, losing that special feeling when it gets played. Animation in general, but especially in fights feel extremely cheap and generic. Sound effects are terrible, you hear the same blade sound over and over again, or jump sound over and over again in quick successions, and it makes the production feel cheap. You would think that important fights would get a lot of budget, but no. Honestly, fight choreography is very generic and nothing special. The manga actually does a better job of expressing fights, and this was definitely the nail in the coffin. Sure, there's extremely rare moments in the anime where a portion of a fight is brilliantly made, but they are few and far between. Another thing to note is that the anime does not make use of CGI to animate large crowds, which is definitely a plus in my book. Sometimes these shots are just still frames, but this is far better than garbage low quality CGI, so I don't mind. And some of them are actually properly animated. The sunny is CGI'd but it's actually not so bad, and not integral to the story, so I really don't care much about that. But...if you compare this adaptation to Eiichiro Oda's work, the anime doesn't come very close. I'm not going to lie. I grew up watching this show. It was amazing. I loved it. The old episodes are still great in my mind. However, after catching up with the anime and stopping for 6 or so years, I revisited the show, anticipating quality shounen action that I was far too familiar with, but what ended up happening was me glazing through poorly paced episodes and degrading animation. I switched to manga after watching a hundred or so episodes. I will continue to do so.

Every arc (except one or two) feel twice as good as the previous one, and Wano currently is just amazing. The Walk to Arlong Park is quite early on (If i remember correctly it is episode 37), and it's the first of many episodes that made me cry, I'd suggest to anyone to go at least to this part before deciding whether they want to keep watching One Piece or not. I prefer the anime medium, but go read the manga if you don't like the pace or if you can't wait for the anime to catch up to it :) I discovered this masterpiece during the confinement in March and I'm up to date now with both manga and anime! :D",10,Recommended,"Nov 18, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b111b63ff2,21,809
"oh god, where to start. At first i liked it, it was my childhood fav. anime but as it aged I slowly lost my interest, but it was still enjoyable, until I caught up to the weekly uploads (in dressrosa) it started to feel like Eternity till something happens and often come out of the episode like nothing has happened. It became a habit of mine to summarise each episode after i finish watching and most of the time the summary is just a couple of words, ex: luffy hit kaido And don't get me started on the inconsistency, imagine watching a full 20 min of bad or mid animations with the goofiest sound effects and some silly side character designs that just disappear after thier arc ends and we never hear from again after they just spent the whole arc developing its character and making it the most intense drama past just so you could (or could not) find a 10 out of 10, 5 minute clip in the end of the episode. A good example of this is senior pink, goofy design, sad backstory, cool fight with franky, never saw him again. Pacing is a big problem even the studio can't fix easily even if they wanted to. But i got a suggestion to fix it, a good example of an anime adaptation, is a silly as it sounds is solo leveling. Hear me out as of right now with the only the season that aired (season 1) they already covered like 40 chapters and solo leveling chapters are much longer, but they didn't cut any content in fact they added MORE content than that of the manhwa, in the manhwa it could only be deduced (was only mentioned as text). On the other side every one piece chapter is like what, 20 pages? Even less sometimes. That's ridiculous if you need to milk a 20 min episode of those couple of pictures. I will willingly continue it despite being my most frustrating series to ever watch purely to see the ending. not saying that it is a bad series but the negative parts are currently out-weighing the good parts I will take responsibility and say that the animated one piece needs a better studio to take over, or for toei to include like 2 or 3 chapters in each episode to improve the pacing and if they needed to take more time to not catch up with the manga then that is a downside i will gladly take instead of this animation that will forever be remembered like this, so that or pass it to another studio and show it as the masterpiece as it was intended. A franchise as big as one piece will for sure get a rework that will greatly cut the number of episodes and and improve the overall quality of the show. And i will be one of the first to watch this rework. But as of right now i will keep the score low but i might change the score when it ends depending on how it ends; if it ends.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 10, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5d82d9bb39,21,2700
"What can i say. One Piece is one of my favourite anime of all time due to its insanely good world building and character development. The world that Oda has built up from scratch never ceases to amaze me with its depth and ingeniousness and has me on the edge of my seat every time they introduce someplace new. The world is massive and full of different cultures and types of people, and is as diverse if not more so than real life. On the topic of character development, the arcs Oda has used to introduce different characters (my favourite of which being Arlong Park) has always explained characters backgrounds and backstories extremely well, and makes sure we have a reason to care for this character before they throw a sad story at us, which induces all kinds of emotion and interest. Overall, extremely good anime without even mentioning the huge improvement in art in recent arcs and the fights, 10/10.",10,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f26c425d57,21,911
"ONE PIECE: 3.4/10 Ah, One Piece. Highly regarded as one of the greatest on-going Shounen Anime to date. When coming into One Piece I expected a lot due to the praise and peer pressure I have seen from the show, and hell, the show has over 20 seasons and 1,000 episodes so it must be at least decent. Man was I wrong. STORY: 2/10 First off the story, it's meh (WAY BETTER IN THE MANGA DUE TO THE PACING). Nothing special, just your average adventure/Shounen story of a boy wanting to become “the strongest” and in this case, find the mysterious “One Piece”. And man the pacing is just awful Takes forever to get anywhere in the story. It took over 30 episodes just to get the damn cook in the Straw Hats. Also the action is just straight up wack. The fights are usually ruined by the animation and there is no sense of intensity during the fights. This kinda goes along with the action aspect but the decisions characters make and story feels very childish (ESPECIALLY IN WHAT SHOULD BE A SERIOUS FIGHTS). The first couple arcs were short and sweet, but once I got to the Syrup Village arc the story started to bore me. I would say the best part about the around 90 episodes I put myself through was the Arlong Park Arc which had good twists and character development, but a decent arc in 90 episodes isn’t anything to brag about. Nothing much else to say in the department besides the story is ruined by horrendous pacing, lack of good action, and very childish actions and decisions made by almost every single character. ART: 3/10 For the time it was okay? No. It’s flat out bad. There are many awkward moments during fights, and lots of repetition in animation. It doesn’t seem lazy, but just has a lack of quality. But since it's an older show I didn’t expect much in this department. SOUND: 5/10 We Are is a good op, everything else is forgettable CHARACTERS 4/10: Man. I’m gonna get hate for this. I don’t like Luffy. Like I mentioned in the story of this review, every character is very childish in their actions all the time. All of them are annoying besides Zoro and Nami. Which have very good goals and reasons behind them, Luffy has an okay goal also but not as meaningful as Nami’s and Zoro’s. Usopp. No. Just. NO. Most of the villains were basic and pretty shallow besides like Kuro in the Syrup Village arc which I thought had a cool backstory. Other than that the only reason I give this area a 4 instead of a 1 is Zoro and Nami, the rest of the characters can piss off. ENJOYMENT: 3/10 The pacing, poor animation, and characters really ruin the enjoyment of the show for me. Nothing more to say. Overall: 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 17 17/5 = 3.4: One Piece had the potential to be amazing but as I said, poor pacing, animation, characters, and action ruined this show for me. I’d suggest forgetting the Anime and just read the Manga. (sorry for the poor English btw)",3,Not Recommended,"Nov 27, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_676e7e2835,21,2875
"One piece is an anime series about a Pirate named Luffy and his journey to try and become the King of Pirates. Along the way he and his crew get into a lot of amazing adventures, like trying to save a kingdom from a criminal organisation, Going to an island in the sky, and many more! People who hate on One Piece are pretty much the average ""Anime Hipsters"" you'll find on this site. A lot of people say the anime has gotten worse after the time skip, but honestly i'm still loving it, and if you're not bored of a series 550 episodes in then it deserves a 10/10 in my opinion. I definitely recommend this series to anyone looking for an anime with a lot of episodes.

"One Piece, the current best selling manga series of all time and in my opinion ""The greatest shonen series to date"". Controversial this statement may be, but here me out, this review is my opinion on the one piece franchise, if you don't agree with me opinion then feel free to message me explaining why. Story: One Piece's story is overall pretty simple, Monkey D. Luffy (Main Character) wants to become the pirate king, in order to do that he needs to find the One Piece, the greatest treasure known to man that was left behind by the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger. At the beginning of the series Luffy sets out on an adventure to do just that and along the way form a pirate crew with the best members he can possibly find. The story of One Piece, along with the characters are what I believe to be the series strong points and why I think it is the best shonen series. The One Piece world is the biggest, most interesting and immersive world in anime that I can think of, you have desert islands, snow islands, women only islands, no matter where luffy ends up going you are always in for something new, fresh and interesting. That is exactly why One Piece stands above the other series such as Naruto & Bleach, it is always coming up with new ways to interest the viewer and keep them hooked. Characters: One Piece's characters in short, are some of the most developed and interesting characters in anime, every member of luffy's crew has had multiple episodes/chapters of backstory, explaining how they became who they are. This allows them to develop into new, stronger people and you get to watch that happen. Now don't get me wrong, some of the side characters don't get as much development as the straw hat pirates but there are so many characters in one piece that giving them all backstory would be nearly impossible. Another positive to One Piece characters is that each of them has a completely different personality, so there is bound to be a character that you really like and can relate to. Soundtrack: Not much I can really say about the soundtrack other than its pretty amazing, the soundtrack is full of orchestrated songs that will give you goosebumps, each song goes extremely well with whatever is happen. A pumped up song when luffy is fighting, to a calm and chilled song when something sad is about to happen, there is something for everyone. Enjoyment: This depends on the viewer, some people don't like the over the top fighting, I however think that's what makes the show fun and its one of my favorite parts about One Piece. Everyone has a different opinion on the show, some hate it, some love it, I think however that everyone can at least appreciate the show for what it is, entertainment. Overall: One Piece is a very well written, very funny and enjoyable shonen series that everyone who watches anime can at least appreciate, if you are thinking about watching or reading the series go ahead, If you make it 50 episodes in you will be hooked. Its the number 1 selling manga of all time for a reason!! :)",9,Recommended,"Jul 14, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_32feec6201,21,3043
"(Caution: you don't have to read my foreword unless you want to, the review according to the rating starts at the ''CHRONOLOGICAL RATING:'' title) Woah! That is certainly my expression through watching the whole anime, and yet it has not ended! I am actually not sure wether I should rate it as superior or inferior to other animes. That is why I decided to make a review on my very personal level. I remember when I saw one of my tight friends in high school watching One Piece at my place (in fact this was before I even watched any animes). However I also got this flashback of my pathetic old self just sitting there in the chair next to him thinking ''WTF is this bullsh*t'' Y'know the one kind that hasn't even tried anime in his/her whole life - which means I WAS an outsider afterall, so that being said I'm definitely ready to give creds to my thankable old friend who watched One Piece while I was being stubborn.. Enough of the history about me, since it's... ...lets say ''half irrelevant'' to the review. One piece is the kind of anime not to be taken lightly. Do not understand me though, it's not a negative nor a positive statement, it's just me speaking for a more neutral side. I just need to point out that there is no such thing as ''this is the anime you should watch for the first one'' neither ''this is NOT the anime you should watch for the first time'' - as it depends highly on your own choice of categorizing. But as I'm speaking for myself, this anime had to bring down much of my time so I can recommend to plan a little better, since 'my' planning along with the animes timeline went to hell. So to simplify: One Piece is NOT beneficial if you don't have the time to watch it... well beneficial might be the wrong word but I hope you'll understand my way of thinking. CHRONOLOGICAL RATING: Story: 9 (Great) - The story made me cry several times, mostly because of the amazing family-history of the main character: Luffy, but also because you will go through all of his crew while it's holding a really epic surrounding which is also timing to the enjoyment. However I still need to point out that this might not happen to those who prefer the story background and everything to be shorter. Art: 7 (Good) - In the beginning I was almost instantly convinced that the draw quality wasn't the ace of this anime (which many anime- and manga companies choose to have). But I still need to say ''no shit'' because I realized soon enough that One Piece airing date was kind of old - which by the way gave me a really negative feeling in the start... ...Though that feeling was soon about to be erased! I probably gave it 100 episodes and the art was shining already. Because the looks didn't matter anymore - which certainly makes me want to say ''Don't judge the book by it's cover''. As I get pretty long into the anime I get to the point where the art suddenly gets even better! I'm sure all of you know the pissed-off badass'' kind of face'' of a person who is very angry yet doesn't say a word, y'know the ''state of concentration''. Well I'm glad to bring you good news because One Piece definitely has it, which is also timed according to good moments to do so (well some moments may be for the sake of comedy, but even that has it's point). So potentially speaking, the art to me is not even worth being on the rating-table because it does not even matter, as I said do not judge it by the cover because then you will most likely quit after a few minutes. Give it some time. Sound: 8 (Very Good) - Haha, one thing that for some weird reason got me was that the voice actor for the main character is a woman and not a boy. Do not let this concern you because I definitely wouldn't believe it until I saw it officially on myanimeist. No but seriously the voice acting is very good and specially the main characters in the anime(Luffys and his crew). As for the opening- and ending songs: 7 in my opinion, after hearing it in several episodes. It even approved the anime a bit and it made it more ''cosy''. Character: 8 (Very Good) - As almost being said in the art section - the characters definitely are amazing, epic, wild and yet even lovely for some weird reason. Luffy the main character of the series is bringing the best outcome of all of them, he has this really amazing and ''I don't give a fuck about superiors'' aura. I mean he can pretty much stand up to god with his expression that will make most of the supporting characters laugh! And that is also what makes his nakamas(crew) even more enjoyable, because he influences them too eventually. He will appear as dumb and retarded as well, but in the end that's just nothing compared to his badass expression when he puts up a fight among the pirates! Which will also make you smile, because his enemies or rivals will definitely first have the kind of expression ''This kid is stupid''. But as I said in the end, Luffy doesn't give a shit, he and his nakamas has this aura among them selves that says ''I've already decided to kick your ass''. Enjoyment and Overall: 6 & 8 (Fair and Good) - The enjoyment rating may come as a kind of ''Plot Twist'' in this review but to me just a single number is not a persons true feeling. ''Fair'' it says. But here is where I come in and say that One Piece still has it's up and downs. Because I gave it a lot of time, which by the way destroyed my sleep and eventually made me exhausted. Sure you can either disagree or agree with me, but let me just say it: One Piece truly was great, but at some point in this exhausted area I had... ...I truly wanted to skip a few episodes. So here is a lesson when watching One Piece: Whatever you decide, think about it. Do not force your sleep down to 6 pm. Once I was craving for sleep, the day after was like a hangover! (Only a suggestion though) If you decide to watch One Piece and love it to the end, I guess you were proving me wrong.",7,Recommended,"Dec 30, 2015",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8ac0a66fef,21,5912
"I am actually a hard-core Fairy Tail fan and it never occurred to me I should start watching other shounens until they stopped the anime for Fairy Tail. I've been hearing alot of good reccomandations for One Piece and so I decided to give it a whirl. Story is 9, because there is not one moment you aren't on the edge of your seat or laughing like crazy. There are some filler episodes but, not too many to be irritating. Art is very good. It's classic shounen style and doesn't make all the characters perfect or powerful. In a sense it's sort of realistic. But, there are times where the art can get very wierd like, sometimes Sanji's hair is flipped right, and sometimes left. The sound is very high-quality and improves the watching experience by hundered-fold. Character is WONDERFUL. There's alot of character devolopment yet, they always surprise you. I'm only down to 210 out of 621 episodes and I hear there are more crew members coming up and only makes me more excited to watch this show.

"okay, so 817 episodes... that's a lot and the beginning is quite slow, but every 100 episodes it gets faster. When i got to episode 100 I thought that it too a whole lot of time and i'm never gonna catch up, but then i got to episode 200 and I was surprised that i'm here already and around the water seven arc is where for me personally I got officially hooked to the point where i knew i was gonna watch this series to the end. The character development you get through the entire story is amazing, including the world development. the art looks kinda dumb and cartoony at first but then you get used to it and it looks amazing and the Toei animations brings out so many feelings when watching is amazing episodes 817 is a good example and episodes 278 is an older example but still fantastic. honestly this show is probably on of if not my favorite show in general, this show has made me feel for the straw hats like i was right there next to them going through all of the adventures with them, and this show is not like your typical adventure pirates show and luffy is the cause of that i'm not going to go into detail but luffy the main character is the main cause any one starts watching this show and no matter who your favorite character is you're gonna love luffy you're gonna smile when he does something that in retrospect is the dumbest thing that he could have done in that situation and still some how pull through.

"At the moment I'm writing this review, I've watched all 923 episodes and, if Oda is not trolling us, One Piece is 90% complete. I don't like this rating system, so I'm gonna write this very freely, and I ask for forgiveness if it's not totally correct, because english is my second language. So, One Piece, in my honest opinion, is a masterpiece. One Piece is the perfect example of a work in the ""adventure"" genre, much like Gulliver's Travel or Don Quixote, with a fair share of humor and drama that makes it very interesting and compelling to watch. If you lived under a rock on Mars for the last 23 years, One Piece is about Moneky D. Luffy, a 17-years old boy from a little island who wants to be the king of pirates, a title he will receive if he will be able to find the One Piece, a very famous treasure hidden by Gol D. Roger, the previous King of Pirates, years before the beginning of the story on a mysterious island. Along the way he will make friends and foes, in a story that mixes adventure, politics, mystery and action. One Piece is a masterpiece because everything is so incredibly well written and explained that, despite its incredible lenght, you can enjoy it greatly. Plot and subplots intertwine in a very intelligent way, and even the smallest character has a big background that explains not only his action, but his role in the story. Characters that are introduced very early make much later another appearence and may become very important, while others have great development along the way. The Strawhat pirates, Luffy's crew, is made of characters which are very different one from the other, and even their enemies have motives and characterizations that makes them very unique: Buggy, Blackbeard, Akainu and Donquixote Doflamingo are just four of the bad guys in this anime, and they all have their very peculiar and charismatic uniqueness. The world building and its lore are also full of details that makes the world of One Piece looking like it has its own life, a world where there is so much going on, despite the fact that you are watching ""only"" the stories of the Strawhats. On the negative side, at times the story can become slow (I will return on this later) and very difficult to continue, to the point that it is better to interrupt it and return to One Piece at a later time; also, the use of Usop and Chopper as comic reliefs is many times very frustrating: I have nothing against some childish humor at times (and also, bear in mind that One Piece was created for an audience of 12-16 years old), but there are times in which I simply sigh at their scenes, because they are not very funny or because they end up damaging the development of the character. But this is about the story, that despite some flaws, is one of the greatest thing ever produced in shonen manga/anime history. The real problem of One Piece's anime is the fact that it is incredibly rushed. Despite the fact that I have no doubt that animators and directors work incredibly hard for making it at least acceptable, at times its art is simply bad, and you can see that they have rushed many scenes, or that they are using static images for even 5-6 seconds to make the episode longer. During the Marineford saga, also, at times the recap of the previous episode last even 5 minutes, which, after an opening of at least 2 minutes and 35 seconds of anticipations, made episodes of 23 minutes last only 16-17. With the start of Wa No Kuni, they used a different art style that is very beautiful and was able to cover up some artistic flaws, but at times they resurface again, and when it happens, you can do nothing but to sigh with your head between the palms of your hands. Despite this, they care a lot about action sequences, and in fact some are really breathtaking: the fights with Enel, Doflamingo and Kaido were actually very good. Music and sound design are quite fine, even if they recycled many sound effects from other Toei Animation animes (Dragon Ball in particular) and there are times in which they feel misplaced, while the voice acting is most times very good, especially Mayumi Tanaka as Luffy, Hiroaki Hirata as Sanji and Akio Otsuka as Blackbeard. In conclusion, if you can withstand its incredible lenght and you're willing to embark on such an adventure, watching its 923 episodes (maybe without the fillers, which are more or less 100 episodes), and you like adventures, action and beautifully written characters, One Piece is for you; if not, well, at least read the manga, 'cause everybody should enjoy such masterpiece!",8,Recommended,"Feb 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_006b3d209c,21,4562
"As of 08/07/21 One Piece is currently 986 episodes with room for at least another 300 before the series concludes. Watching One Piece is a major time investment. In the time it takes to catch up with the show you can learn to ride a unicycle, whistle, or pick up Japanese. With this in mind do I recommend One Piece? No. One Piece has some of the best moments in Shonen anime but the journey is only for the most dedicated or braindead of weebs. Sound - Sound is good. Luffy’s rubber noises, Zoro’s swords, Law’s Room, background tracks, etc are all memorable but (like most things here) can get repetitive. Voice acting is good. Art - There are three main styles; Pre-Timeskip (ep1~500), Post-Timeskip (ep500~890), and Wano (ep890~ ). Pre-Timeskip is my favorite of the three. It’s nothing crazy but overall solid. Post-Timeskip opts for a brighter color palette while making body proportions stranger across the board. Animation quality takes a significant hit and female characters get really big boobs. Wano keeps to the style of Post-Timeskip while adding more texture and fluidity to the animation. As the series progresses increasing amounts of time are dedicated to reaction shots. This is when the camera cuts to a few side characters with their mouth open in joy/surprise/fear/sadness in response to whatever just happened. These shots are barely animated, usually just some squiggles around the eye or a jaw moving up and down, and serve to pad for time. The Dressrosa arc is particularly bad with this. The camera cutting to all the tiny midget people every two minutes made me want to kill myself. Characters - One Piece characters are pretty standard. They’re not particularly deep but each fill a niche in progressing the narrative and worldbuilding while also being cool. No individual character is particularly mind-blowing but the way the series manages to keep so many of them relevant across hundreds of episodes is impressive. Story - The world of One Piece is amazing, the plot is mediocre, and the pacing is awful. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, who ate a magic fruit which turned his body into rubber, on his journey to find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. The main story is broken into dozens of smaller individual arcs that tend to follow one of two patterns; a member of Luffy’s crew leaves and needs to be rescued or a country has been taken over by a pirate and needs to be saved. The rescue arcs (Arlong Park, Enies Lobby, Marineford / Impel Down, Whole Cake) are better than the nation-saving ones (Alabasta, Skypeia, Thriller Bark, Fishman Island, Dressrosa, Wano) with a few exceptions. What makes One Piece special is the power system and lore tying all these arcs together. The series’ core is a bunch of pirates who eat magic fruits and fight eachother while running from marines. Layers are added to this in the form of how people counter magic fruit usage and what type of government sponsors such an oppressive marine force. Other long-running Shonen either collapse into nonsense from a lack of foresight (Dragon Ball Z / Super) or morph into something entirely alien from the original concept (Naruto) but One Piece has been building up its core for 20+ years. The magic fruit system has evolved to the point where it can stand toe to toe with the nen system of Hunter x Hunter or the alchemy of Full Metal Alchemist. Ideas are set up in the first season that pay off 900 episodes in the future. Which is all very cool. Unfortunately getting to episode 900 is an absolute slog. Early seasons are fun but because the anime releases one episode per week the pacing is gradually throttled to a crawl to avoid catching up with the manga. The majority of episodes past 500 feel like watching a highschool presentation where the student has some good ideas but didn’t prepare and is just stalling for time until 30min of class ends. Conclusion - A 5/10 anime with occasional flashes of genre-defining brilliance. 6/10",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 7, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d9b7f46446,21,3970
"I'm about 700 episodes in, and still watching, but I can't recommend this anime to anyone. There are lots of reviews that paint a picture of why this anime is so good, so I'll skip over that (those reasons are valid) and highlight why I can't recommend this anime. I'll speak in general terms and avoid spoilers for the most part. The pacing is wearisome, to say the least. It's so slow, in fact, that for the average arc has a higher number of episodes than source chapters. For example, the Dressrosa arc is 101 chapters in the manga, and 117 episodes in the anime. One Piece as a manga already has a fairly slow pace, so having every chapter stretched out over 24 minutes (less than 19 typically if you discount the intro and recap every episode) really draws it out. Ultimately the problem is the serialization and weekly deadlines: the pressure to produce a chapter (and later an episode) every week forces the author to use less detail, outsource, and draw out sequences and the story overall. We've seen this issue in Naruto, Dragon Ball, and of course, One Piece. One Piece is a product of the environment it's created in, and that environment is one that demands a chapter and an episode every week, one that demands a quantity but not quality. Because of this, One Piece as an anime has loathsome pacing: often reusing animations, drawing out already drawn-out sequences, using unnecessary and drawn-out flashbacks, and a large amount of recap, and a small amount of filler arcs. For an idea of pacing, the aforementioned Dressrosa arc is 117 episodes, with one episode every week coming out to 2 1/4 years. This arc is canon but it's importance to the overall progression of the story (the group's circumnavigation of the world, search for the One Piece, and Luffy's goal to become King of the Pirates) is not proportional to its length. Ultimately Dressrosa is not much more than an obstacle in the path of our heroes, the ultimate villain of the arc is ultimately a subordinate of a greater villain. There is important story developments throughout the arc, don't get me wrong, but again, the length of the arc hugely outsizes its overall importance to the story. Most story arcs are like this; the heroes defeat a villain, only to have that villain rapidly replaced by a greater villain in the same or similar role. Overall this pacing diminishes all the other positives of the anime, making it impossible to recommend. I will continue to watch it, but mostly because I have invested ~700 episodes worth of time into it (it's kind of a curse). I find this anime is best watched in the background while you do homework or something that requires a moderate amount of attention, kind of like a Twitch livestream or something. I often watched unpausing/pausing it while playing GTA Online due to the game's large amount of time spent traveling between points. Other than that I don't recommend it.

"One piece is another well respected and ambitious shonen series especially in Japan. It is currently the leading crown jewel of shonen in its home country and the most popular manga in the world. Believe me if there is any shonen series out there that deserves this recognition, it is one piece. Helmed by Eiichiro Oda himself, the author of one piece has a level of commitment and confidence to his manga that you don’t often see in many mangaka’s careers. One by one Naruto, bleach, fairy tail, hitman reborn, magi. They all fell apart at some point, usually towards the often unplanned or convoluted climax of a story. Or some shonen adapted works become too reliant on typical standardized tropes that often are unexecuted and not consistently planned leading to plot holes. One thing all large ongoing shonen have in common is they are plagued by inconsistency both in the writing and themes and elements presented. This is a growing trend that is predominant in this genre. This is where one piece greatly improves the formula on a level I have honestly never seen before within Shonen. This series really opened my eyes on the same level as like Hunter X hunter did. The plot is about adventures and pirates sailing the seas’, meeting new exotic locations with new belief systems, ideologies, races of different cultures and exploring deeper stories behind each of these locales all with different solutions and consequential problems to solve for our protagonist Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw hat crew. It’s a world filled to the brim with uniqueness, diversity, colorful abstract themes at every corner and even philosophical notions with a touch of heroism in poetic motion which is so unique to oda’s style of immersing you into the experience and helps to establish your connection to these characters and the story presented. The series has some of the most inventive and well-developed cast of characters with tragic but also drama fueled dramatic backstories along with a very deeply crafted and Imaginative expansive world just full of beauty. One piece never feels like its derailing off track or contradicting its written code that is the mechanics and rules written that dictate the structure of the series and its universal principles outlined by the author. This sets the foundation of the many hundreds of episodes and continues along consistently with those established elements. (An example would be something like how Dragon ball and Dragon ball Z differ greatly from being a series about classic adventures and down to earth conflict with a focus more on comedy and slapstick to galaxy type cosmic battles of destruction and a clash of superpowers. Now granted I love Dragon Ball Z for a lot of reasons but one can argue that it some times truggles with trying to find its middle ground in terms of the audience and its source material.) This is something that does not happen with one piece. Characters do grow more powerful as the series progresses, but it’s confined with-in the rules established and never breaks that barrier feeling like a deconstruction towards a different series. Each individual character be it main, secondary or even villains will go through lots of emotional and physical development and the scaling is maintained and well balanced, never giving you the insinuation that there is any sort of absurd power curves or as most fans put it “ass pulls” come with out warning. One of the largest reasons why I have such hope that the ending of one piece will be great, because this man has mapped out and has drawn the final arc of the story from literally two decades ago and has since dropped the breadcrumbs often hinting or leaving subtle clues that tie and connect seamlessly to some of the deepest mysteries of the plot. In short you can feel that the show is building towards something with many lingering questions and answers that will eventually come to the forefront of this epic saga. I swear I have seen this show a lot and I am still picking up on certain foreshadowing that was conveyed literally hundreds of episodes ago which later became a huge plot point. This man plans so meticulously, that it literally boggles your mind and to be able to achieve that for a serialization as long as one piece is just... Unbeliable! Oda enjoys exploring things with such subtly, it feels like this man knows exactly what is on the horizon and loves to throw in such amazing Easter eggs to see if viewers are really paying attention. This is also another reason why this series has a huge following of theorists and analytical reviewers. In terms of the art and style. The diverse and rich universe that oda creates with some of the most impressive world building and the ability to establish each new locale with different laws, cultures, morals, rules, etc. The often-exaggerated display of facial expressions and abnormal designs can turn some people off but if you look above that exterior you will notice a unique style that is not used in any other anime with such a wide range of variety that is often hard to interpret just from mere words. Objects and characters represented in the one piece world are often large in scale and tower over the main protagonist in a way that makes you feel their dominance and control that the one piece world is full of such monsters and incredibly powerful adversaries. The significance to this design choice by oda is amazing and really exemplifies the massive threat level conveyed in this world. The anime actually makes this element of the series more prevalent. Also, the type of scale the one-piece world has is unprecedented. You will never see a world with such rich lore and world building and oda gets a lot of his ideas from so many other novels, movies, real world and fictional historical references, etc. So, there is bound to be something that you will recognize from other iconic anime or films. Things like Alice in wonderland, the god father, Dragonball, Moby dick, to name a few. Don't be put off by the often-classic style of animation if you’re watching the anime, because it will evolve over time. Obviously with a show that has started in the early 1990's and is continuing into 2022 will have some changes in terms of art quality and animation. Seeing the transition to 16:9 is where you can really see the massive difference. The Music deserves a mention in this series. Without it, it would not be the same. The music suits the scenes of battle marvelously, it gives the people who's watching seeking for more and more action. The orchestrated trumpets and trombones, mixed with the drums fit the action scenes very nicely and the piano themes that you hear during some of the drama, really creates a powerful scene that is trying to bring out your emotion and just tingles your heart and soul. You really do feel for these characters as almost living in their world. Believe me, you will cry, you will laugh, and you will even get angry during some of the more intense dramatic moments in this show. The background music is also very capable of strengthening suspenseful or triumphant moments. There is just something about it that fits the story of pirates sailing to sea so well. Additionally, you may become so attached to the main cast, that even considering the prospect of our heroes dying at some point, would absolutly devestate you. I have never in my entire anime career been more attached to a cast of characters like the Straw hat Pirates. With that all being said, I just want to say that one piece is not an episodic type of series, it is a massive serialization with an overarching narrative, but the core of the series is structured differently than Naruto for example. The series is a more of a character driven narrative and the mystery and lore take kind of a back seat for a while. There is a common misconception where people perceive this series as being very slow paced for that reason and the story does not move to the end goal any time soon but as i said, the driving force of the story is the characters them self's well the mystery and lore are conveyed throughout the journey. Eventually It will come full circle and you will just be in awe at how carefully planned out the plot really was by the ending. You can witness the many clues and hints outlined throughout the plot and details early on that have a groundbreaking significance later in the story. In closing to say I know most people are turned off by it because of how intimidating it can be with its nearly 1000 episodes and nearly 1100 chapters of content and still on going. But rest assured this is not pokemon, it is a deeply well developed and expansive story with rich lore and world building and it’s about journeys, adventure and mystery that will captivate the audience and become a spell binding experience that will sure to intrigue you to no end. Check this one out if you’re a fan of anything shonen and as Rayleigh says: ""Nothing in this World happens by Mere coincidence.

"This is a great series (in some areas), and i've found it to be very lovable to many people. The art is very smooth and emotion full, and the characters are, though generally doll, enjoyable. One of the only thing dragging this down, is the fact that they've made such a rich number of episodes, that its retarded. Should be cut down to 100 or less, and just end the whole thing soon. If they, sometime, decide to do so, ill get my ass back into that series. Mep",7,Recommended,"May 26, 2010",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d3f0c107d,21,462
"Ok I'm going to try and keep this short. At the time of this review (episode 759) Story: amazing. Indepth. All of it seems to be connected. If I were to complain it's that the story can seem repetitive from arc to arc. Another good thing about this anime story is that after looking back at the arcs I found that I enjoyed the filler arcs the most. There is an art style downgrade from after the time skip that is pretty bad considering what art we have today in anime Another thing that started idiot aging me post time skip was the incidental music. I mean for 400 episodes it's alright but by the dressrosa arc I was kind of sick of it.

"~~~~~~~~~~~~~SPOILER FREE REVIEW~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ This review is for those who think ""one piece is shit and think one piece is too long, so who's gonna watch it"".. anyways, i have given episode guide in the last. :-) PLOT: 10/10 among all the animes i have seen, One piece has the biggest plot among them all, the vastness of one piece plot is beyond measure as compare to other animes. Character Development: 9/10 (TO EACH TO THEIR OWN) Character development of one piece character is Dope. It's like when they are visiting new places, they are learning new things and understanding new people's feeling and learning about the truth of world government and crimes and injustice in this world. One thing i like the most about the theme of one piece is ""They don't follow the rules, they make their own rule"". + one piece contains upto 500 characters and each one have their own character development. It's not just about hero being punching everyone in his way, they all have their own character development. Characters information: Monkey.D Luffy: (8/10) (Main character) Well.. About Luffy.. He's an idiot (no doubt :D ) but there are times when he made decisions which totally describes that why he's the captain in his crew and why others are not, despite the fact that each member of his crew have more intellectual level than luffy. ""Sure.. He's an idiot, but that's why he's our captain."" ~Zoro Roronoa Zoro: (10/10) A badass three sword-style user swordsman and right hand of luffy. Though he have a bad sense of direction (almost too bad) but his morale value are way too much ! He is one of those character which will make you hooked to the one piece and loyal to it. (not gonna say much about him to avoid spoilers) Nami: (8/10) Navagator of the crew who has lust and greed for money. Probably the heroin of one piece (not luffy's fiance though, not even close). Usopp: (7/10): Usopp the sharp shooter (LOL exaggerated,) or should i say , ""Usopp the Lier"". Sanji (10/10): Cook of the straw hat pirates, who only uses legs in fight. (pretty badass ain't it?) (not including other characters to avoid spoilers). OST: 7/10 Ost are decent , not gonna say they are awesome but some ost will make goosebumps .. <3 Opening/Ending song: 7/10 they are decent. For example: you can listen to ""oh we share the music"". Pacing: 6/10 Now this is the major weak point of one piece. The pacing of one piece is quite slow. Animation: 6/10 the reason why people say that one piece sucks is not because of the story, or the plot , or the character, it's the animation studio a.k.a toei animation that sucks. well the animation .... well to be precise: animation isn't on par with the dope plot and character development of one piece. (Well it keeps getting better and better though) It's still better than naruto though :3 Gore: 6/10 blood is quite shown in this anime but not like ""cutting in half, ripping head off"" etc Fights: 9/10 THEY ARE DOPE. Overall enjoyment: 10/10 believe me, once you are hooked to one piece, you can't stop watching. I'm not a one piece fan boy , I just state the facts. I was the same as you guys who didn't watch one piece but said it's shit .. but ! after watching it my review completely changed! Episode guide: So , what scares people the most is the amount of episodes of one piece which is 783 up to date (quite long though). and when people start watching early episodes they say "" this anime is not that good the way it is hyped"" well How can you judge an anime which has 700+ episode by watching 10 to 20 episode? it's not even it's 10% episode ! so I'm gonna rate one piece episodes so that you can understand and make up your mind while watching it. Episode List: 1 to 50: (6/10) 50 to 220: (7/10) 226 to 370: (8/10) 382 to 491: (10/10) (yes! it's a 10/10) 493 to upto date: (9/10) Keep these ratings in mind while watching one piece.",9,Recommended,"Apr 9, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_535c067fc8,21,3864
"Story For series of this length, there’s a fairly intriguing piece of conjecture that I occasionally enjoy trotting around. According to the theory, no matter how awesome the original premise, no matter how charming the cast of characters, no matter how competent the studio, every long series will tank after about 75 episodes. As evidence, a myriad of lengthy anime can be cited that begin excellently and then slowly degenerate into recycled material and filler. Kenshin was excellent until some genius decided to deviate from the manga. Kodomo no Omocha was brilliant until the series drowned itself in the utterly craptastic New York arc. Naruto was actually fairly fun until Gaara and his whiny, sniveling flashbacks slowed the series down to a monotonous crawl. Prince of Tennis, Slam Dunk, Galaxy Angel... I could rant on this phenomenon for hours, and probably will someday. Of course, my theory has an annoying, irrefutable, and ultimately fatal hole in its logic. Even when I’m at my most eloquent, I inevitably find myself forced to tag “…except One Piece” onto the end of every sentence. According to the hypothesis, the series should have died off episodes upon episodes ago, and yet continues to succeed well beyond any possible expectations. Just as other shows of similar length are running out of creative steam and tormenting their fans with shamelessly shitty schlock, One Piece draws from a seemingly infinite well of creativity to deliver time and time again. Put simply, One Piece seems almost limitless in its capacity for entertainment. Granted, the storyline is not without its weak moments. There are scattered filler episodes that really don’t belong, and the dragon puzzle arc is some of the most boring material that I’ve ever willingly watched. However, although during these moments the show seems like it might finally go the way of Inuyasha, the creators always bounce back to deliver more of what everyone loves. The Arabasta arc, which has just recently concluded, is one of the best segments of the entire series. This fact alone leads to the inevitable question of what separates the show from lesser works. What makes the series as good as it is? Why has the series succeeded where so many others have failed? Essentially, what is driving the show to remain so engaging for such a ridiculous amount of time? The answer, I believe, draws not from what the story is about, but how the story is approached. With fight scenes, simplistic humor, and the ever-present emphasis on the importance of friendship, the anime contains many of the expected trappings of the shounen genre. However, a characteristic seemingly unique to One Piece is the distinct air of genuineness that the show seems to permeate. With other shows of similar length, I’m often struck by the distinct feeling that the show has exactly one thing on its mind: money. Oftentimes, an anime with an established audience will simply stop coming up with new material, and start recycling what they’ve already made. In this creative void, the show will rigorously follow its formula beyond any semblance of what is entertaining. Thus, the studio is able to pump every possible cent from its cash cow until nothing is left but the lifeless husk of what the show used to be. At this point, ratings dip, and the studio cancels it at a completely arbitrary point, neglecting even the slightest of closure and basically spitting in their fans’ faces. With One Piece, however, the feeling is crucially different. While watching the anime, one gets the impression that Eiichiro Oda, the author of the original manga, was focused not on money, but something much more substantial: having fun. Every element of the storyline, from the delightfully absurd jokes to the most serious of plot points, seems to be there because the manga creator enjoyed putting them there. This, I believe, is the reason why One Piece has remained fresh for so long. For some unfathomable reason, the creator enjoys pumping out volume after volume of golden material. Furthermore, as opposed to many other manga to anime conversions, the studio is actually faithful with its material. The result is a storyline that, despite some inevitable inconsistency, is one of the best of its kind: an unnaturally enjoyable romp across the seas of a thoroughly original world. Animation Animation, while fairly nice, is not completely free of the penny-pinching shortcuts that typically plague shows of this length. Backgrounds are often rather ugly and hastily drawn, and anything drawn at a distance tends to be a little too oversimplified. The show also sports some truly ugly character designs that take a good deal of time to get used to, and a good deal longer to actually appreciate. The fight scenes are almost certainly the highlight of the animation, which seem to involve a lot more money than the rest of the show. The action is usually very well timed, and character movements are suitably lithe and convincing (and by that, I mean as convincing as a person made of rubber could possibly be). A lot of fight scenes in other anime tend to overuse repeated footage, but One Piece doesn’t seem to have this problem. Overall, One Piece’s visuals are pleasant, but certainly not groundbreaking. Sound Music starts out on a fairly shitty note, with one of the lamest OP’s I’ve heard that I can remember. After the first episodes, the anime begins to cycle through the opening and ending songs at a fairly quick pace, and soon there are too many of them to actually keep track of. However, just about every song is a fairly mediocre J-Pop track, and none of them are actually good enough to really get excited over. Background music doesn’t really stand out, but never becomes noticeably repetitive or distracting, either. Voice acting tends to be fairly good, although there are exceptions to this (in particular, that one dog from the Buggy arc comes to mind). Characters Love them or hate them, few people would disagree with the statement that each and every character of One Piece is decidedly unique. From the bizarre character designs to the off-kilter personalities to the extensive back-stories, there isn’t a whole lot here that can be seen somewhere else. The question of actual appeal, however, is a slightly different issue. For the actual protagonists, many, many people (including myself) are going to have an initially difficult time liking characters like Usopp. Also, a good deal of the supporting cast in the early episodes has the tendency to be excruciatingly annoying (Buggy the Clown, Kobe, Guy in the Box). However, whether the show is actually improving at development or whether it simply takes time to grow to like some of the more pathetic characters, this is becoming much less of an issue than what I’ve previously made it out to be. Amazingly enough, I’m beginning to like Usopp as a character, and for the recent Arabasta arc, there wasn’t a single character that I wasn’t fond of. Furthermore, the characters that happen to be above-average for the show tend to be downright excellent. If there are people in this world that are immune to the charms of characters like Sanji, Luffy, or Nami, then I haven’t met them yet. Each one of these has an immensely compelling back-story and a loveable and distinctive personality. Also, each can be amazingly funny when played off of the rest of the cast. My one possible complaint would lie with Vivi, who seems a little dull at times; there just doesnt seem to be anything interesting about her personality. However, this could easily be just because she’s not quite as original and wacky as the rest of the crew. As a whole, the characters are an ultimately endearing bunch, especially if one chooses to overlook the weaknesses of some of the more minor characters. Overall Do I believe that One Piece will last forever? Surely not. All great things, even ones that initially seem infinitely robust, must eventually come to an end. I’m sure there will come a time where One Piece will either cease to be entertaining or simply cease production. However, even if One Piece begins to suck from the very moment that I finish writing this review, the sheer length of quality episodes that have been released already easily elevate the series to far beyond most anime can dream of. Besides, if the Arabasta arc is any indication, One Piece looks as though it will remain entertaining for a good deal longer.",10,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eadd5f72cc,21,8443
"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, a twelve year old girl (me) was new to Anime, and wanted to get into it. She stumbled across One Piece, and since she had nothing better to do, she binged watched it and absolutely adored it. But, then the fanbase started to get pretty violent, and the episodes airing at the time were dragging out a bit too long, so she decided to drop it for a while. During the year while she was gone, she discovered different Anime. Shows she actually enjoyed more than One Piece. And thus, returning to One Piece after the fandom had calmed down, after watching new shows that were mature and moving, she realized something she never knew. This show sucks. It sucks really bad. Story: Every cliche shounen show you can name. No really, just think about any shounen anime, and the first things that come into your mind are there. We've got the childish idiotic protagonists, we've got the overly eccentric girl who hits said protagonists because he's stupid, we've got the dark broody badass with a heart of gold, you can pretty much name everything that's going to happen before it happens. Art/Animation: The animation for the first 100 episodes was fine, for the most part. But in the newer episodes, it just looks so glossy and lazy. It actually hurts my eyes. Sound: The music is fantastic. Really, just get the soundtrack for this thing, it's the only thing that's worth it. Character: Very, very poor. Everyone's just your stereotypical Dragon Ball rip-off. Luffy = Goku, Nami = Bulma, Zoro = Piccolo, Sanji = Vegeta, Usopp = Krillin, Chopper = Chiaotzu, Robin = #18, ect. Enjoyment: None. It was enjoyable up to the Arlong Park arc. After that, it just got boring. Each episode is 20 minutes, and they waste most of that time with themesongs and recapping of the show's plot, and the previous episode. And the time that they do spend is wasted on filler, and the characters just standing around and talking. WHY THE FUCK DID I EVER LIKE THIS SHIT!!?????? Overall: Why am I giving this a 5 when I just tore it apart? Well, I do kind of still have a soft spot for it, as it used to be my favorite show, and it was what introduced me to Anime. And I used to like it because I was, like, 12, and I hadn't seen too many Anime at the time. So, if you have a 12 year old kid with you, show it to them if they wanna see something, it's harmless. Or, if you're new to Anime and you wanna see a shounen show, then go ahead and check it out if you want. It's harmless enough. But really, the only reason this show is so popular is because its fanbase is just a bunch of twelve year olds who like cliche shounen stuff, and 21-year-olds who're just as immature as the kids. Believe me, I've been in this fanbase. So, just get up to the Arlong Park arc, and just stop. Trust me, it's not worth it. If you want something original that's mature and relatable, instead of childish and tossing in backstories that's just a bunch of people dying, then I'd suggest giving it a skip.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b00ac1e481,21,3002
"When it comes to One Piece, there are two kinds of people. The first ones, obviously, are the people who hate the guts of this anime. Second ones are who love it to the core. There's virtually nothing in between. Let me tell you. For the ones who watch the first few episodes and go on telling stories like ""Oh it's not even worth it. I watched 5 episodes and I'm done"". You missed out on an amazing journey. It's like the saying ""Never judge a book by its cover"" (Even when the book has 800+ chapters!). The first few episodes can only be expressed as part of the cover. Shit gets real once you get a hang of the later episodes, like during Arlong Park Arc. After that, you're put on an amazing journey, with lots of enjoyment, character development, feels and much more. And if you ask me, One Piece actually has one of the best character development plots I've seen. I do admit though, scrolling through some other reviews, I saw the criticism on how almost all characters never really die, no matter how hard they get hit. I do agree with that. But at the same time, this element isn't of too much importance if you ask me ._. So for those of you who give One Piece a bad review at first sight, I advice you. Give it a try, and you'll love it.

"I had started watching/reading One Piece in early February of this year and it is an amazing watch. As I had not watched this as a kid, this will not be biased and won't be clouded with 4kids terrible dub or nostalgia. Story: 9/10 The story for one piece is very interesting, unique and big. Oda has done an amazing job with providing really great stories across each arc, each with its own feel and style. While at first before the grand line the story might come as underwhelming, it gets alot better. Around Arlong Park is their I personally got hooked watching it. Alot of the arcs is unique when it comes to its plot and is a great journey with the crew. Their is some complaints though. Some events are stretched longer than it should be and rushing in others, but overall the journey and thrill of the story is great. Art: 7/10 The art of the show is a hit or miss at times. At times the show looks great considering the length of the series but at times, takes a noticeable hit where their would be low frames, alot of still shots and disproportionated characters. Overall the art is good, but not great. Sound: 8/10 If it was purely for the soundtrack of the show itself, this would easily be a 9/10. Each song is unique and fits Into the show and the events that are taking place throughout the show. With orchestra level songs to truly sad piano music to jazzy blues, the music is great, though often repeats itself, is great. However, the sound effects itself are okay. While their is alot of good sound effects like specific character sound effects to luffys arm stretching, it's quite iconic. Their is alot of sound effects that are quite cringeworthy and too childish for me. Often only have 1 or 2 variations of the sound, Toei would often play the sound effect way too much and be quite annoying. Characters: 8/10 The characters in One Piece are great, with a variety of memorable characters, especially in the straw hats crew. Alot often having deep and pronounced back stories and with unique charactistics that are enjoyable to watch. Even the villains, often with interesting motives and personalitys. If I had one gripe with the show/manga, Oda often has a lot of of pretty much unmemorbale, serving little to no actual purpose in the show besides making an event longer than it should be. The Characters are a great aspect of the show. Enjoyment and Overall Conclison: 9/10 Overall, the show is great and though the show is quite lengthy and has its faults, the journey and story is amazing and should be enjoyed. I absolutely adored the character development and variety of locations the crew explores and the variety of characters they meet along the way. I recommend the show highly of you give it the time as it's a great show to watch and make you want to watch more alot of times.",9,Recommended,"Nov 25, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_87aeb02d05,22,2809

"PLEASE READ FIRST: I have not yet caught up on One Piece so my review is only for the first 141 episodes. Think of it as a first impression if you want. I'll rewrite my review every 150 episodes or so. Please don't get anal on me if you don't agree with this review, like i said, it's only for the first 141 episodes. I have not written many reviews so constructive criticism is always more than welcome. Lemme just start off by saying if you have not yet started watching One Piece because you're intimidated by its size i would highly recommend starting it just to get a feel for it. It has definitely earned it's right to popularity. Plus you can always take it slow, there's no need to rush an anime if you don't have the time or ability to rush it. As for me i'm taking it pretty slowly, it took me three weeks to get to episode 141 and i've been taking a break from it for the past month but i will start watching again soon. Story 8/10 One Piece is a story about Monkey D Luffy who is a some what dumb witty pirate on a quest to find the greatest treasure in the world, the One Piece, and become the Pirate King. You get to watch how Luffy gathers his own crew (nakama), gets his own ship and fight for nakama power. That pretty much sums up the amount of story i've seen so far. I gave the story an 8/10 because i did feel that it was very good and it gives the anime huge possibilities. Especially since this is a long time running shounen, the amount of arcs and character development they can do is almost endless. Thankfully there actually has been a decent amount of character development. I really can't wait to catch up to the series and honestly i've always loved pirates as a kid so when i heard there was an anime about pirates that was over 600 episodes i was like ""oh hell yea!!"" Only reason i took a break was because the pacing of the anime was just too god damn slow. Like the fight between luffy and Mr. 3 in the alabasta pre arc... omg no. too slow so no thx you. This is my main problem i have for the story, Oda Eiichiro is a genius but his pacing can be almost unbearable at times. My second problem is all the arcs so far have been extremely predictable. It basically goes like this; Luffy and his crew would go fight the bad guy and the bad guy's crew, they would beat up all the unimportant grunts of the crew and then there would be a few enemies that were actual threats and they would have to fight with Luffy's crew. Then when it was time to fight the main bad guy, everyone would wait for Luffy to come and kick his ass. That pretty much explains every arc so far. :/ Art and Sound 8/8 The art was pretty good for being as old as it was, i can't really complain to much because as One Piece progresses you'll begin to notice the art also progresses with the series. Nothing too impressive yet but i'm sure as i catch up i'll start to see the higher quality of the art and animation. The sound was pretty good, not too many memorable songs so far but there are one or two in there. That does not mean they don't have good songs! One Piece has songs that fit the situations they're placed in but unlike Fairy Tail or Magi the sound track doesn't really stick to me. Character 10/10 Yes, 10/10 for the characters, Luffy is hilarious, he's honest and even though he's some what dumb, he has a true love for his nakama. Most people don't like nakama power in anime but i for one love nakama power, if it's a shounen and it doesn't have nakama power than it just doesn't feel right when i watch it. Obviously that's just my opinion, i know a lot of people hate nakama power with the passion but as a kid till now i've always believed in the powers of nakama. I like Zoro's character too because he's a total bad ass. He has three swords and he tears up every body with them. Nami is cool because even though sh'es useless in a fight, she's useful in like everything else from navigating to operating the ship. Usopp can go to hell. Chopper is amazing and i actually haven't got to the character development for nico robin yet so i really don't know too much about her so i can't say anything about her yet. Enjoyment 9/10 I really really enjoyed this anime. It's funny and has a good feel to it when i watch it. It has a lot of nakama power and a good amount of action in it. The situations The Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in are hilarious. If only it wasn't for the pacing of this anime i would have rated it a 10 for my enjoyment. Cause honestly i can tolerate the predictability of the anime but slow pacing is a no go! Especially for longer series. Overall 8/10 This is an anime that should definitely be watched by everyone. For the most part it's very good, the story is very original, and like i said before Oda is a genius. One Piece has a snowballing effect so the more you go the more it builds up and it will eventually turn to this giant masterpiece of snow and amazement.. that is very predictable with terrible pacing haha. No seriously though, i'm glad i started it.",8,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4b43000690,22,5017

"Look, One Piece as a franchise is fantastic. Good story, great characters, entertaining fights and a nigh unparalleled world. The problem is that adaptations sometimes don't do justice to the source material, and One Piece is by far the best example of this. I started watching the anime about 2 months after finishing the manga, and after forcing myself through 40 episodes of terribly paced, poorly animated (even for the time) slop I had to quit. Once when I watched it late at night I literally fell asleep because so little happened in each episode, EVEN after skipping the mandatory 5 minute recap on top of the intro and outro (only just over half of each episode is actually new content.) Even this content which should be enjoyable is ruined by egregiously long pauses, shots of character reactions, flashbacks and anything Toei animation can do to save a buck, because they know that however badly they treat the anime it'll still be one of the most popular in the world thanks to the franchises overwhelming popularity. TL;DR : Toei Animation ruined what should've been an easy 8/10 + series, just read the manga because that's actually good",2,Not Recommended,"Jun 28, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ef8bd8454e,22,1152

"SPOILER FREE Many people are deterred because of how long this anime is. I was too. And hearing about the pacing issues did not help its case. However after hearing about One Pace* I decided it would be a good way to at least give the show a go. I started watching two weeks ago and thanks to One Pace drastically cutting down on time I managed to get 350 episodes deep in this short time frame. How good is the actual show? Well I can't say for the full thing obviously, but from what I've seen and heard about future arcs, the show is FANTASTIC. I've been loving it so far. *What is One Pace? It's basically the anime but the pacing is fixed! It stays more true to the Manga. It saves you so much time and you lose out none of the useful content. (One Pace saves 150+ hours of bad pacing and filler content. And you'll feel it.)

"****DISCLAIMER******** This is my opinion, it doesnt mean mine is right or wrong, its just what i think of the series ********************** Hello there, I think i speak for most of us when i say that one piece is one amazing piece of fiction. Ofcourse there are ups and down in one piece, but every show has that, still thats no excuses to justify the flaws, I will give you my take on the work of Eiichiro Oda. PLOT: 10/10 What a surprise, another one piece fan has geven the plot a ten, he's just like all the others that say the plot is just amazing. Let me explain Our story starts off with a boy namen luffy. Ok not to special, he beats up some fat woman, then saves a pussyboy and continues to beat up more Peoeple, he geïnstalleerd others to beat up People with him. Thats bassically the plot of one piece, well thats actually not really True, the thing about the plot of one piece is that its verry deep, disturbing and quite the emotional rollercoaster, but yet it remains funny, goofy and verry childish. I think this is a part that many people dont realise thats really impresive, Very few can make the combination of those work. The story might start off a bit slow, but it really grabs you during arlong park in my opinion, this is the fisrt time where you see things that you dont often see in other anime, i think the nami scene is a perfect example. I also really like the fact that oda isnt affraid to make his series lenghty, it gives you more emotional connection with the story, ofcourse this isnt for everyone, i can unstanf that a thousend episodes is a burden to watch ans that it can really demotivate people, but in my opinion you get high value for youre time. I think its a good thing that you can go really in dept about the plot, i really like that because that makes one piece a big world to explore. I also really like the fact that the villains come back. I think that makes for a better world building wich one piece is in my opinion the best in. I alsp really like the fact that the plot is yet complicated, but simple. There are maybe 5 plotholes at maximum in one piece, this is also verry pleasant. That makes the plot more consistent. I also really like the emotional storys of the characters we follow, there verry tragic and i quite like that. It makes you feel more empathy for a certain character and you most of the times understand why a certain character does thing because of it. CHARACTERS 10/10 I really love the characters of one piece, there verry well thougt trough of and surprisingly verry well writen, for a series thats for children it has very detailed characters, this makes you able to feel more emotions for a certain character. I really like this, i also really like that all of the characters are unique in their own way, you could evem sympethise for some of the villains. Take hanyaball for example, at first he looks like a lazy piece of shit that only wants a higher position, but trough out impel down he has shown to change and even stood up when facing an impossible challange. One piece really does a amazing job at making characters. There childish yet so mature. Its really fascinating to see in my opinion. OTHER ASPECTS: Lets talk about the other aspects of one piece. I really like the childish artstyle, it just makes me feel more at home. I also lkke the current animation, the only thing i dont like is the use of cgi. Its just quite alot and certainly in latest episodes. I was really dissapointed to see cgi ships and kaido in the gear 5 episode. I really like the music in one piece, i think overtaken does its job perfectly. It gives alot of hype when you hear it play, im always at the edge of my seat whenever i hear this banger play. The intros are fine, there not the best and not the worst, a thing that deffinetly worst is the pacing in one piece anime, the manga has good pacing but the anime, my god, its like going to a lecture about grass, its verry slow and i think toei should really improve in this department, it makes the series feel so much worse than it actually is, fortunatly theres one pace, this fixes a huge chunk of the pacing problem, this doenst mean that toei cant be blaimes for the horrible pacing. Overall i think that one piece is an amazing piece of fiction, i would really recommend it to people who want to go on the ride of their lifes. It has everything and it does it all amazingly. My final rating of one piece so fat is a 9.5, if one piece was only anime it would be a 6 because the pacing is just horrible. If anyone likes to point out things, i'll gladly have a discussion with you about the topic. Many thanks to the people taking the time to read my review, im really sorry if theres alot of gramar mistakes, english isnt my native language and my spelling is horrible, yet i hope this was bearable to read.",9,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e5de31a4e6,22,4831

𝐋𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐲 is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the paternal grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the sworn brother of late ""Fire Fist"" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary chief of staff Sabo, and the foster son of Curly Dadan. Luffy is a pirate and his lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. He has eaten the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which gives the consumer's body the properties of rubber. As the founder and captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, he is the first member of the crew, as well as one of its top three fighters. 𝐑𝐨𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐚 𝐙𝐨𝐫𝐨, also known as ""Pirate Hunter"" Zoro, is a pirate and a former bounty hunter. He was the first member to join the Straw Hat Pirates, and, to date, is considered the largest threat and most dangerous member in the crew after Luffy. His fame as a master swordsman and his great strength, along with the actions of his captain, sometimes led others to believe he was the true captain of the crew. He is one of the top three fighters in the crew alongside Luffy and Sanji, and his dream is to become the greatest swordsman in the world. Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to as the ""Worst Generation"" (formerly known as the ""Eleven Supernovas"".) He currently has a bounty of Beli320,000,000.

She currently has a bounty of Beli66,000,000 ""𝐆𝐨𝐝"" 𝐔𝐬𝐨𝐩𝐩 is a pirate and is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates, and the former captain of the Usopp Pirates. When Usopp was first introduced, he was often (comically) labeled as the ""Liar"" of the Straw Hat Pirates, due to the ""Uso"" (うそ) in his name meaning ""lie"" or ""falsehood"" (嘘). He was born in Syrup Village, and was first mentioned by Yasopp, his father. He was officially the third (unofficially fourth) member of the crew, and the third to join, and, including Nami and Robin, also the third to rejoin, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.

He is officially the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Since he was born in North Blue, he is the first Straw Hat not to originate from East Blue. He is one of the Monster Trio in the crew, alongside Luffy and Zoro. His dream is to find the rumored chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife.

He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth to join Luffy, as well as being the youngest member on board. He has a bounty of Beli100 due to being mistaken for the crew's pet.

Robin is also the first member to have once been an antagonist. She ate the Hana Hana no Mi. During the Post-War Arc, she became involved with the Revolutionaries for two years.

Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats until circumstances forced them to become allies. At the request of the Franky Family, Franky decided to join the Straw Hats to fulfill his dream of creating and riding a ship capable of circumnavigating the world, the Thousand Sunny. He is the eighth member of the Straw Hat crew and the seventh to join Luffy's crew. He currently has a bounty of Beli94,000,000.

"this is one of the best animes it has alot of stories derived from many legends and characters that are also taken from iconic people and the plot twist are just awesome and thought through ,and it has alot of unanswered questions though it is in 800+ episodes but the stories and the why they are told is really satisfying and feels great but one thing that most viewers must understand about this anime is that it is ok to skip some fillers episodes maybe come back to them later if you want but i remember when i started watching this anime there where about 643 episodes i only watch this anime for month to 2 months tho i didn't skip most of the episodes but you could do that. so this is my only complain: one piece is the greatest anime in the story ,character design and plot twists but the only ccomplain i have is that it has alot of fillers alot of episodes that is there just to add the num er of episode side tracking some times it take 4 episode for some one to do something that we all are waiting for and is just like moving 1 inch to open the door for example which is frustrating . so if they make an version with out that bullshit that will be great ... WOULD I RECOMMEND IT : YES, of course you woukld be missing out alot of stuff that you would never get from hundreds of thousands of any other anime episodes....

"One piece review! (as of episode 710) =SPOILERS CONTAINED= - Synopsis - To this day Luffy, A little boy who ate the Gum-Gum fruit is on an adventure to find the one piece! A show centered around its amazing characters, and amazing world building, I feel it deserves my time for a review! This show, on where I am currently standing is at 710 of 851 episodes. My name is Seigyoku, and this is my thoughts on one piece! -plot/story- 8/10 The story is about a boy, named Luffy who had grown up with his brothers Ace and Sabo with a bandit mountain gang. Sometime after Luffy has decided to start his journey as a pirate! He has met many friends along the way. The story is undoubtedly fantastic, the show gives me a sense of adventure and I feel like I'm with Luffy all the way on this journey. An example of this is when Luffy comes to the arlong park arc. When I first started this arc, it didn't impact me at first, but later in the story during the Fishman Island arc, it amazed me on how far ahead the story could be planned. it takes skill to be able to organize a chronological story while managing it on a weekly manga basis. as for the backstory arcs, they are worthwhile, rich with a story it leaves you satisfied on knowing the events of what happened. I'd say an amazing backstory example is Law's backstory. It showed how much it can change a person, it felt like I was suffering with Law during the whole thing. On the back of Law's coat that he wears, it says the person name who saved him, which is amazing. it leaves me speechless to know everything has a meaning in this show, and the plot is just about perfect. - characters - 9/10 This anime does characters in a unique way, that makes it stand out from other shows. This being a long-running shounen series, It gives the opportunity to build characters up, and make you really attached to them. A good example would be Usopp on the arc of Water 7 Island. The arc was mainly focused around Robin, but even other characters were brimming with rich interaction with the story. Usopp loved the ship of the straw hat pirates it was from his hometown built by one of his most loved. I could feel the pain from Usopp when he reacted to the news of the ship being unsalvagable. He had pride with the ship, and when he heard Luffy's decision his pride and love for the ship made the two have a serious clash which was the highlight of the water 7 arc in my opinion. Usopp is my favorite character because he used to be such a self-doubting person, and that's why he lied most of the time, to cover that up. In the show, he learns to overcome that self-doubt during that arc. He thinks back on the mistakes he has made and wants to fix them, and it shows that he has matured a lot, he still is cowardly, yes that's just his nature. -Art/Animation- 6/10 Now, this is probably my most liked part of the entire show, I apologize to the hardcore fans. This show was demanded on a weekly basis, so I can see why it was struggling with consistency on the animation subject. It just felt like I was looking at a painting sometimes if you want an analogy. Which somewhat threw off the immersive feeling of the show. Not all apples are rotten, there were some amazing scenes, such as mihawk slicing a massive ship clean in half it had so much detail in the scene I couldn't keep my eyes still, but for the majority of the show, it was lacking in some aspects. Now as for the art, it was unique in some arcs, I really liked the look of marineford, it had this feeling that it had the embodiment of the safety of the world and it had such an interesting design. The fact that there were so many characters it was amazing on how consistent the art stayed natural, even less significant characters looked good. -music- 7/10 The music was pretty darn good. The walk to Franky house and hearing that song of the straw hat pirates literally doubled the adrenaline and excitement I was feeling, and some of the soundtracks that really gave it that vibe of it being a monumental event. The death of whitebeard gives me chills when they were naming the casualties and the music that was playing helped with that a lot. So yeah the music was a good impact on the immersive feeling of the show. -final thoughts- overall score: 8/10 I do not regret watching this show, it was worth the time, and thank you Toei animation for orchestrating such a masterpiece, the world loves you for all the joy you have brought to the anime community, this is seigyoku, and this has been my review on one piece, Sayanora!",8,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e0786b60f4,22,4541
"-Edited September 2023- First of all, I love One Piece's story possibly more than any other fictional narrative. I have grown up with this series, following it through my teenage years as well as my 20s. For every major plot development in the serialization I can remember where I was in my life. Needless to say this series has had an immensely powerful influence over my personal development, giving me motivation during high points and moments of ambition in my life, and encouraging me during low points in my life to keep fighting. However, these thoughts refer to the core narrative and characters of One Piece, not necessarily the animation by Toei Animation Studios. In all honesty, I still tend to recommend the first half of the series. The episodes are decently animated (albeit with a certain stiffness that gives them a unique, nostalgic charm), decently paced, and have decent sound design. The core narrative remains true to Eiichiro Oda's original manga work, and quality of the storytelling remains consistent. However, at around episode 500 the quality of the series begins to tank, and it is truly jarring. I simply cannot recommend this anime in its current form to those who are seeking consistency in the quality of an animation, and I daresay most true fans would agree. The pacing has become an irreconcilable issue in both the long-term and short-term storytelling. Chapters of the manga are spread out over several episodes, forcing the production teams to pad every episode with extended scenes of characters running, or thinking to themselves, or simply just standing still in a single, panning frame of animation. Fight scenes and impacts which are sometimes a single frame in the manga are now extended to seem like a ""tug of war"" in power, which kills tension. The animation quality varies wildly, with some scenes being enduring examples of incredible artistic direction by notable animators (search ""One Piece sakugo on YouTube), and other scenes looking like the animators drew them in their sleep. Finally, the sound design is completely stagnant. They have used the same sounds for footsteps and gunshots for the past 23 years - literally from episode 1. There's one sound effect in particular that plays when a character has a vein popping out on their head that literally just sounds like mustard squirting from a bottle. Even the current arc which was marketed as being a ""redesign"" of the anime art style still suffers from the atrocious pacing and stagnant sound design that plagued the last 300 episodes. On top of this, the current arc (as of 2023) has used 3D animation for the villain in what I can only assume is a way to cheat having to animate a character with a non-human form. All I can I do is shake my head. I love One Piece so much, but the anime deserves better than what Toei Animation Studios have turned it into. The Netflix live action is pretty sick tho.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_61f25fe0a5,22,2913
"More character & plot development in a single arc than most anime series have throughout their entire run. Sometimes this series suffers a bit from the deadly ""Bleach-itis"" (a good show that is kept alive on a steady IV stream of filler arcs that serve very little to move the actual overall plot forward), but even then it's not TERRIBLE, and fortunately these arcs are not ALWAYS these monolithic full season filler arcs. But I would recommend finding a filler avoidance guide nonetheless. Boa is top-tier waifu material, not for her looks, but because she is hardcore ride or die, ready to take on the whole world for Luffy. Fuck you.

"I started watching One Piece on a whim to find out why it appeals people so much, and as soon as the first opening rolled, it pulled me inside its world. One Piece's biggest selling point is that it has some of the best world building in all of anime. It pulls you so much into its world when it shows you the Navy and the World Government doing its stuff, and the other pirates reacting to the biggest blunders of the Straw Hats. Some characters in this show just radiate so much charisma that you automatically respect them if you're passionate about the show such as Gol D. Roger. The arcs in the story are structured to be such that they can be independent, and at the same time have an impact on the overall story. Even though the anime has been criticized because of it's slow pacing and at times bad animation too, there are still reasons to watch the anime such as great animation at other times and a beautiful OST.

"Before you think i am reviewing an anime i have not seen sompletely: I have seen it all and i am completely up to date with all episodes ( waiting for the new ones ot be released due to Covid it has stopped ) and i am up to date on the manga aswell. This is the number 1 anime and manga for me. Not only does it speak to a wide array of people it crosses all ages to enjoy. It has the simple adventure feeling for the younger generations and much deeper layers and humor for the more mature age. Storyline flows, even when there is filler materials in the anime it is still fluently written and the more you see and read the more you are sucked into the adventure with the main crew. But not only that, you are also getting more and more involved with what seems to be just side characters and their backgrounds.

"Just one point. I watched all sorts of teary stuff and never shed a tear, my friends sometimes called me heartless at times when watching stuff together. One Piece, however, made me cry a waterfall over a ship. Yes, a ship. Some tips to help you enjoy One Piece better: - do NOT watch 4Kids dub, and also sub is much preferred than dub - First few eps may be boring, especially until ep 20 or so, but after that it becomes one hell of a rollercoaster. - As a personal challenge, try not to fall in love with Luffy, kinda impossible xD - The pacing is indeed slow, I give you that, but its all worth it at the end. If you are a person that cannot stand it, either just fast skip the eps or just read the manga, both are fine... just saying wano arc right now has upped their animation quality so much that it is worth your time despite pacing or whatever.",10,Recommended,"Jul 12, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_5a56e9b995,23,854
"Bruh One Piece is the best you can binge it and the main reason I really like One piece is because of its story I feel like many anime could have so much more while one piece since it has so many episodes you could fill in so much even with all those episodes there aren't many fillers and even if they are fillers they are somewhat entertaining. It focus on many other character and each ark has a purpose it shows the character growth of many different characters some arks maybe focus on one character more though I like this makes it so some characters stand out in that ark and what they have to do with it some of the sad stories of the characters backgrounds are sad and entertaining the concept of 3 different types of devil fruits and sub categories within them is a good source of a fighting mechanic things such as the 3 different types of haki and how they can be used also contributes to that. Oda does a really good job of showing the characters personality, strength, and how they stand out because every character is unique and uses there power differently such as how sabo got inspired from ace though he adds his own techniques such as his dragon claw",10,Recommended,"Sep 25, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_027e3b04c6,23,1169

Its a very unique and subjective style, though after so long with it, it really starts to grow with you. characters are amazing. they're all very well done and unique. even characters that have hardly appeared for years are still remembered, and not just thrown away after one use. even temporary characters are very well done, and can generally be remembered when glancing over the story. overall, its one of my favorite anime, and even decades after it ends, I believe it will very well be remembered in a positive light.",10,Recommended,"Jan 8, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6ed20379e0,23,968

"As everyone says, this is indeed one of the best anime. It has a nice story, amazing characters and all. But, I do have some major complaints about this anime. First, as everyone says, it's a bit slow-paced & people almost never die which shouldn't be the case considering the plot. Apart from these, this anime shows sexuality too much, and at places and points that it just looks stupid. People call it fanservice but I don't think the majority of fans like that. Eg. the most obscenity is done with NAMI showing up to the point that, She doesn't even mind being nude in front of people and all. According to this Anime, there r bathhouses in which men and women bath together naked. Like WTF!. But, don't be mistaken this anime isn't romantic at all, which I don't really mind as most main characters consider their dream most important. But, considering this, the mindless and useless show of sexuality looks even dumber. THANK U!",8,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_64c9bd98b2,23,934
"I love it! If you are the type who loves adventure,mystery,thriller,comedy,proper character development,you will definitely love it too! The pacing can be slow at times but at end of the end,you can be assured that it will be worth watching.Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other.

"I have watched over 1000 episodes of one piece(not including filler) Disclaimer: I am specifically talking about the anime and not the manga or any of the movies. Just the tv show. I started watching one piece back in 2020. About a week after Netflix added the couple of arcs of the show. I was hesitant to watch it because I knew how long the show was and still running. But I decided why not. If I dont like it then Ill just drop it. Some people would say one piece starts off slow and boring and others would say they enjoyed it from the very first episode. I was one of the ones who thought it started off kinda slow. I heard one piece is like a one of a kind show but when I started my one piece journey I couldn’t see that. And I dont blame anyone that also feels that way. I dont even think the start of the show is bad just not all that intriguing to me. I actually didn’t like the main character Luffy at first. I thought he was childish(which he is) and also annoying. It seemed like every opportunity he had he will announce that he is a rubber man trying to become king of the pirates. And I got annoyed of that very quickly. But I did see why people would say it is enjoyable to watch. Slowly learning more and more of the big one piece world and meeting new characters while learning there backstories and seeing why they act the way they act is supercool to watch. As you get more into the story you start to realize how big and deep the one piece world really is. Getting introduced to more characters with their own goals and learning more about the world of one piece. As you keep watching you realize how deep the world of one piece really is, which adds more depth into each protagonist and antagonist of the story. Now to talk about some negatives. One piece is not a perfect show.Obviously the 1000 plus episodes is intimidating for people thinking about watching the show. My advice for those people is that you dont have to rush to watch all those episodes. Take your time with it. Take breaks of you need to. If you are really interested you will catch up before you know it. Also at times this show does use things like creating unnecessary shock moments just to add drama to the story. The reason why this show is so damn long is simply because of the awful pacing. Its hard to deal with it especially how faster pace new anime shows are becoming now like JJK, Black Clover, MHA and more. And yeah the pacing sucks. Its either something your just gonna have to look past or make it be a reason why not to watch it. There was an arc in the show, Skypiea, that pacing was so bad I was really considering dropping the show. And Skypiea isnt even a bad arc its just the pacing that makes it so hard to watch. But I kept going on my one piece journey. To conclude my review, I think one piece is an amazing show with amazing lessons behind it. The foreshadowing and world building in this show are truly something special. Yes its long and the pacing can be horrible at times, I truly believe it is worth the watch. A lot of people like to say or choose Naruto is better than one piece without giving it a chance(Used to be me) But I truly believe if you like naruto then you will like one piece.

"I started One Piece as just a little man, but came back to finish it off just a few months ago. Once a huge event happened at about 2/5 of the story, I found that the pacing from then on was cripplingly slow. Only due to the studios wanting the show to run all year with no breaks, has the pacing in this anime been brought down from a smooth sail in the calm belt into a small raft in a thunderstorm and anyone who's seen this show knows that the calm belt is far more exciting. For an example, there is one panel in the manga that seriously takes up 2 whole minutes of an episode. 1/120 of a manga chapter is apparently 1/10 of an episode in this show these days (of course not counting the lengthy intro and recaps). Despite the problems on the anime side of things, anything directly adapted from the manga (characters, plot, locations) is nearly flawless and the world-building is exceptional. You cannot find many plot holes in this series as there are explanations for so many things. I can't give examples because of spoilers but the world-building is done magnificently. The power systems in this series, being Haki and Devil Fruits are used very creatively. Turns out a guy made from rubber can be more than just flop his arms about... waaaay more. The Haki, being a power system separate from Devil Fruits, helps in stopping every new character using a Fruit, bringing more variety in the battles. Alas, I can only recommend you watch until episode 405. After that, the quality and quantity of this show drops significantly. After I dropped it I went and read the manga instead, now I read more manga than I watch anime. So at least I can thank the awful pacing of this show for introducing me to that.",7,Recommended,"Mar 16, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2da747922f,23,1713
"One Piece is by far one of the 3 shounen anime i like the most, aside from naruto or my hero academy. But one piece deffinetly gives you the whole experiencia it just literally makes you laugh, it makes you cry, it makes you twitch with excitement like an 5 year old kid. One would describe it as an “Anime/Manga about pirates” , but its simply much more than that. It never fails to entertain you but at the same time deals with a lot of grown-up themes like freedom and racism. The anime has been running since 1997 and the manga a bit longer than that. That’s almost 19 years. But it never feels old. Mostly because its a really huge world filled with lots of interesting characters each with their very unique and endearing personalities. Its hard not to get attached to these guys, because they have very human qualities that make them relatable and likable. It has a very well laid out story that makes you look forward to what happens next. Its no surprise that this is one of the big three anime alonngside naruto and bleach, but even though the story never gets boring, at least for me, really think you guys should give this anime a chance, the first 30 episodes of the anime are a little slow and hard to watch but after the loguetown part it just keeps getting better and better, definetly a 10/10 anime that everybody should give it a chance. If you’re an anime fan, chances are you’ve heard of one piece and have probably seen or read it. Even you’re not into anime or manga, you should give this a try.

"At first, I hated One Piece for it's style of forcing ugly designs on characters, making me swear I'd never see it. Oh boy, here we are. One Piece has a very complex, amazing world full of interesting islands and cool characters that you love to see. If you like seeing anime without having to worry too much about ""drama"" or all that, One Piece is an amazing watch. One Piece has it's ""ooho teary eyes"" moments, which are either done sadly, or in a very badass way that you love to see as a viewer. One Piece's first half (episodes 1-500) delivers amazing story arc's, letting the viewer see exactly what they want during it's perfect moments. One Piece's strong points are it's world and storytelling, which is done in an amazing way, introducing many amazing character's while the story progresses into a bigger sea. The more the characters get stronger, the stronger the enemies become. I could compliment the FIRST HALF of One Piece to be a whole 8/10 in terms of overall enjoyment, but the animation studio gave up after episode 517, it's timeskip. After One Piece's timeskip, the story gets progressively more boring with it's animation and blatantly trashed recycled animation, delivering mostly moving stills for it's episodes. One Piece loves to deliver a good story with amazing characters and the studio behind it loved to give it justice by gifting us with an amazing soundtrack and good animation. Until it didn't. With One Piece's length, I honestly recognize why they gave up after 517 episodes. The anime is worth watching, trust me. I would HIGHLY recommend watching One Piece until to the timeskip, then switching to the manga. I dropped One Piece after it's Dressrosa arc, which got too much for me to handle after it's constant moving still's. Sorry One Piece, you've gone on for too long for me to watch you.

"Piece is the best anime I've ever seen, with over 1000 episodes and over 20 years in the making, not only has it not lost it's charm, it just got better with Ark Vanos animation. Mr. Oda, who is a legend in manga, has worked so hard in characterizing the manga of this work that in no other work can you see all kinds of characters with their own story lines like the world of One Piece. Mr. Oda designed the world of One Piece based on our own world, where no land is even similar to another that is not seen in other anime. Of course, the anime had problems that need to be solved, one is the long fights and the dragging of the story that sometimes makes you nervous, the second is bringing back the failed and disappeared people to the story to make the story. more attractive. Thirdly, the animation problems are best compensated by episode 500 onwards, this work has given the best work in the comedy, adventure genre, which is rarely found in other works. Check out the movie's soundtrack, which I think is good, although it doesn't stir our emotions as much as Naruto's soundtrack. It should be noted that this work is a model of Dragon Ball, which is much more mature than this work. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this if you're new to anime, but if you've been watching anime for a long time, you'll be very happy.",10,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c1c0503b8d,23,1324
"Review 29: One Piece (Yay Gum Gum fruit)!!!! A Worldwide favourite, but i only have one question, is there actually an anime out there that can take this one off of the shelves in over 1000 different countries?? I think not. Meet the clinicaly insane straw hatted pirates, that always seem to get their own way..... One Piece is a world wide famous anime and manga series to little five year olds, too 60 year olds who still remember the series from a while back. The series is packed with food, fighting, rather confusing moments and really (and i emphasis really) weird looking pirate maniacs that will do anything to get the one piece and the devil (gum gum) fruit. The main story in the series... well when i say main story i mean the overall series.... is supposed to about a young high pitched, squeaky voiced boy named Monket D.Luffy finding the one Piece to eventually become the King of Pirates like in ancient myths and legands. One problem though, he doesn't even have a ship, never mind a crew. And due to his young age no other pirates take him seriously even though he's trying to do them all a favour by helping them get to the One Piece and becoming the new King of the Pirates with them in his crew. The only time people or pirates usually take him serious, this keeps up through out the whole series of One Piece, is when he shows his what he calls his ""Gum, Gum Abbilities""... So to us this will be the devil fruit powers. When a devil fruit is consumed and depending on which type you have consumed then special un'realistic powers are released that you may or may not be able to control depending on how mature and smart you are.In this case Luffy has consumed a rare Devil Fruit that gives the consumer to extend parts of his of hers bodies to unbelievable lengths, and when punched the punches fly right off of his body or when shot at the rubber sends them flying back at the opponent. So basically we have a weird boy with an even weirder rubber body..... The series is based in another and slightly older fashioned world where pirates, thieves, bounty hunters and other strange peope all exisist mainly to defeat pirates but also to keep order in the world, stop wars between other countries and are also mainly here to stop pirates from over taking other towns and cities like they have done in the past and when we watch the series we get to see the over taking of many cities and towns happening right before our straw hatted and clinically insane pirates. The main character (as we have already established) is Luffy, his main goal in life is to be like Gol D. Roger. He was in fact the previous Pirate king and created the One PIece, a treasure that most normal people think is fake and is a disgrace to their world. Others like Luffy (and some others) Who have realised that if they obtain the One Piece they will be the next Pirate King, and as soon as news about a new pirate king starts to spread many more people will believe in the legand, which then means more fights and violence for Luffy and his soon to be crew. Everyone in the crew is human, well to an extent anyways.......... Monkey D. Luffy; Our main and insane character for the One Piece series. he's the leader of the straw hat pirates and has an extremely strange fighting style that stands out to the younger generation of anime watchers and lovers. His fighting style is unique but funny, this adds to the genre of the show which is of course a comedy. As his body strecthes to these unbelievable lengths and his body can also deflect damage from opponents it adds humour to any fight that he's in which means that if your reading the manga the reader can relax as they know that he'll never be in any real danger, when watching the anime we can sense some danger in a few situations but nothing to serious to make the watcher hang on to the edge of their seat as they are worried for him. He's a fun loving boy who doesn't really see the seriousness of fighting or being a pirate until other members start joining the crew. He doesn't really care what other people think of him or what other pirates think of him and his crew, the only time he will care is when a pirate or human hurts on of his crew members or damages his ship. He isn't the type of person to start a fight for no particular reason and usually thinks things through when it comes to fighting, when it comes to his friends and every day life he turns a little bit stupid, the stereo typical type of person for an anime like this and as he is in fact the lead character it means all other characters are also laid back, relaxed and at times can be as stupid as him. The crew eventually becomes huge, one of the first members to be the fearfull Roronoa Zoro..... A three bladed samurai, he was born to kill and to assinate anyone who gets in his way. Luffy managed to get him to join as Zoro had already been captured by the authorities and was tidied up to a pole, he hadn't eaten in a while so Luffy had amanged to taunt him with food and bribe him by setting him free on one condition....... He joined Luffy's crew, even though at this point he didn't even have a ship. The recruitment for the other members also covers the same sort of method, Luffy makes a deal with them as long as they join his crew. As i said eventually there are quite a few members that join the crew, some hate Luffy as he's way too hyper and some admire his dreams and goals in life to become the next king of the Pirates. we see new and old characters that Luffy has encountered through the series joining the Crew once they get to know him a bit better, like Nami we see her in the firs episode of One Piece and the audience expects her to join the crew straight away but it takes a while as she follows them around and then decides to join, and there are others who we only encounter a bit further on in the series like Brook, Sanji, Usopp, Nico Robin, Franky..... And if you haven't even watched the series even once then you still might of heard of little Tony Tony Chopper!! All in all the series is amazing, i've only seen parts of the series and little snipits but it's still an amazing series! Only theres one little problem, the begininning of the series graphics seem out of date, and when we see the latest episodes the beginning ones don't quite fit in. But apart from this the series is amazing and is a must watch, it's famous world wide and has captured the hearts and minds of millions of anime and manga lovers!!

"One Piece is a different sort of beast than other shows. I'd undeniably recommend anyone to watch it, but the issue lies in that in order to really get a feel for how good the series can be. In my opinion the series isn't very good until the Baratie arc that starts at episode 19, and only really begins to show how good it can be at the Arlong arc at episode 31. That isn't to say the early episodes are god awful or anything. But if I was only rating the series based on the earliest episode I'd probably saddle it with a 6.5 (fine, but not good). So the thing about One Piece is that it does require investment. But after those 19 or 30 episodes, the payoff is enormous. There is nearly 700 more episodes of a great anime with limited filler. One Piece just really checks all the boxes for me: it can be funny, can bring you to tears, and can be undeniably badass. As I have been reviewing shows more and more, I've noticed that one of the aspects that leads to me to rate shows more highly is the world they take plae in. In plenty of great shows, you have a set world and you are exploring the characters story within that world, but One Piece leaves you exploring the world along with Luffy, as his story progresses. There is so many mysteries yet to be solved in One Piece, and discovering more and more about it is part of what makes One Piece so grand. The characters are also done pretty well. The dynamic of the crew really represents an all for one, one for all type mentality. A lot of dramatic events happen throughout the show, and watching people come together through those hardships is endearing. Really the only reason that this is not a 10 for me is that I reserve my 10's for shows I consider true masterpieces, that can't be improved (I only have two 10's). And for as great as OP is, it does have it's issues. It starts pretty slow and it's pacing could be better (if you are watching week to week, this gets pretty frustrating. As a binge it isn't as big of a deal though). Also, the art is meh. I do kind of like how unique it is and it does get better as the show progresses, but this can't really touch some other great shows when it comes to the art. Although it is done much better than other shonens and not as prevalent, there is some filler. Even though the filler arcs aren't bad the core series is definitely much better. So, quick summary. Slow starter (give it at least 20 episodes), but fantastic plot and interesting world to explore and learn more about as you are watching the series. Humor is Good. Drama and the feels can be spectacular in big moments. The action and fight scenes are good. Watch One Piece!",9,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a686306193,23,2649
"Story : 10 Art: 5 Sound : 8 Character : 8 Enjoyment : 6 Overall : 7 One Piece is one of the biggest anime and manga out there, not just in length, but also in popularity, now popularity is not a good way to proof quality, but when the source manga is not only THE most sold manga in the world with over 100mil more sales than the number 2 most sold manga but its also THE most sold COMIC in the world by a single author and it got a record in the Guinness book, beside manga sales its also one of the most popular anime even here on mal at number 32 and 4 in most favourites, its also one of the most talked about show in youtube, with many big anime youtubers being fans of it, like Gigguk, chibi and even someone who is more critical like thatanimesnob said it was actually pretty good at some point, and again I know that popularity doesn't equal quality, but when a show is THIS popular, you can at least fairly say its does somethings good. over the years the show's quality has changed a lot, and not in a linear fashion where it kept getting better or kept getting worse, it just went up and down in quality a lot, to the point that if I had to rate each arc differently some would get as high as a 10 and some would get as low as a 5. The Good : 1- If you look at the genres for One Piece in MAL you'll see : Action, Adventure, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Shounen, Super Power and I have to say one piece does all of these genres very very well. Action : the fights in one piece aren't that frequent with the story more focused around other things, but when they do happen they are very well done and there many different types of fights, you have some fights that are centred around raw power or some that use tactics and brains, and every fight has a lot of meaning behind it, in a sense that the stakes are high and what the characters had to do to reach that fight was a lot, basically the author really knows how to hype up fights before they happen. Adventure/Fantasy : the is probably one of the best thing about one piece, I've met many different kinds of people who've watched the show and one thing they always praise -even if they hated most other things- is the world building and the adventure in it, the world in one piece is HUGE with many island that each have their own kind of twist, a lot of different factions from pirates to world government to underworld workers to kings and leaders of the islands, almost every type of mythical creature there is, from mermaids, fishmen and dwarfs to giants, dragons, undead and talking animal people ( and much more ), and experiencing all of these islands gives a really nice sense of adventure, and the world is also very well connected, for example one character from the early episodes ends up being in an important character in an arc 500 episodes later. Comedy : this one is different to each person but I found the comedy in one piece hilarious and has really good delivery and timing, I'd link you some funny moments but its hard to understand it in its own without having an idea about the characters. Drama : its hard to go into this one without too much spoilers but I can say that one piece has affected me emotionally with its many tearjerking moments, even ones that you'd never expect. Superpowers : Superpowers in one piece can be very simple or very creative and interesting, but even the simple ones can be made creative with how the characters use them. Now MAL doesn't say One Piece has Mystery, but I'd say it does, Oda (the aurhtor) also leaves a lot of hints and forshadowing in many parts of the story and its why there are a bunch of one piece theories out there, I mean just search "" one piece theory"" on youtube and see how many results you get. and the ways these mysteries are revealed are also pretty good, not in an asspull kind of way but in way that will make you go "" whhaaat! so thats what happened!"" 2- One Piece has some of my favourites Soundtracks that are really effective in doing what they are trying to do, whether its for building hype or making the viewer emotional. 3- The characters are also a great part of one piece, with many of them having really awesome designs, interesting/emotional backstory, and each have their own goals and ideologies. Our main crew in particular is really great, seeing their interactions with each other is surprisingly one of my favourite things about the show, they are all interesting in their own ways. The Bad : Just like my ratings indicates, One Piece has a lot of problems and even someone who loves one piece like me can see them. 1- For starters the animation is pretty bad overall, it changes over the course of the show, some parts its Sakuga level but most of the time its pretty bad, especially compared to today's standards. 2- while I did say the soundtracks are usually great, the recent episodes haven't really been using great soundtracks, sometimes the SFXs are all over the place, The voice acting for the most part is pretty good and I have no problem with it, but its nothing mindblowing. 3- the pacing of the anime is very very slow, the manga has 870 chapters ( as of right now ) and the anime has 798 episodes, just by looking at those numbers alone you can tell just how slow it is, with the recent 200 something episodes only adapting one chapter OR LESS per episode which is just crazy slow, one piece the manga is already slow enough at some parts but the anime just made it really terrible, there are also always about 5 minutes spent on recaps+opening. however that is not always the case, while the early episodes also had slow pace, its wasn't nearly as bad as now, and it was a very minor problem, which is why I kept watching the show and didnt drop it. 4- Being repetitive is another one of One Piece's problems, however this one is minor, because while every arc has core elements that happen in ever other arc, for the most part its still a fresh new arc and these core elements are done in a slightly different way. 5- Asspulls, One Piece doesn't have many of those but it still does have them and its a problem, fortunately though, when it does happen its in the arcs that are considered one of the better arcs ( because of other things of course ) and so this problem is overshadowed. 6- some parts are pretty much useless and the show would be a lot better without them. Overall I'd say for sure give One Piece a chance, and keep going until you just cant watch it anymore, if you reach that point before episode 500 then well I guess its not for you, if you reach it after, then I'd say move over to the manga and give it a try, its worth it. And thats about it, I hope you found my review helpful, I apologise for any English mistakes I had (English is not my first language) I wasn't going to write a review but I noticed the reviews for one piece are either all 10s or all 5 or below, and I found both to be ridiculous, so I decided to write my own review.",7,Recommended,"Jul 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4107110a9e,23,6942
"One piece! Seriously a great story! I liked the plot a lot and the character Luffy is just amazing. He gives a very positive impression about how people should live their life - simple, without worries, taking challenges and working hard to achieve the goal. All the characters' behavior is appropriate and suits to them. All songs especially the opening ones are so good. I actually downloaded them and I listen to them frequently. And the whole anime is so well made. Each scenery, each island and the sea looks so unique and beautiful. The action is so exciting and the suspense is just thrilling. What will happen next? Who will do what? That's the question I have every time I watch an episode. And I really enjoyed watching it. Some drawbacks are the extended fights that just go on for episodes and one gets bored to wait for the fight to finish. There are some fillers which are out of story line and aren't much interesting. One piece is going a bit slow, which I hate the most. But, the overall story is great, characters are great and its fun watching it.",9,Recommended,"May 9, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d238c53569,23,1066
"One Piece is excellent in every single way. The characters are deep and interesting, the world feels really alive and fleshed out, and Oda really knows how to pace arcs correctly. Sadly, the anime adaptations goes from good to great to amazing to ok to absolute clusterfuck. It's a really depressing case of unending anime series syndrome. I remember watching this about 7 years ago when there were about 400 epipsodes, and you could mostly skip all the filler arcs and end up with a kind of sluggish but overall enjoyable series, but later arcs, I believe starting at about episode 430-ish, have a lot more filler INSIDE the actual adaptation arcs, which makes it that much more difficult to get around. I've also seen some of the newer fights, and they were really disappointing. The animation was really bad compared to the better arcs (Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark and Shabaody Archipielago). My recommendation for watching One Piece is: look for a guide that says which episodes are filler, and try to skip as much of it as possible. If it ever becomes unbearable, switch to the manga. Personally, as soon as I caught up with the anime, I started reading the manga. I still read it to this day and it's on my top 3 manga list, alongside FMA and Magi.",7,Recommended,"Nov 27, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6d97c79f56,23,1253

I caught up with the anime in 2 years and I'm waiting for new episodes to come out. In terms of action, it is also good like Naruto. After you have finished the Skypea arc, trust me, the real story will begin. It will lead them to a new threat, THE WORLD! It will have our heroes a hard time in overcoming this threat until today.

"I started One Piece when I was around 9 or 10 years old. I stopped watching at around 60 or so episodes in due to lack of access to the show. For the last decade of my life, every 3 or so years, I've been able to jump right back in, remembering every moment of each character's story, every place they've been, all the fights, and pretty much everything. One Piece is distinct in its ability to stick with you like nothing else. The style, the music, the story, everything is so memorable and special. Gotta love One Piece. I don't even have to watch a quarter of this show to know it's really something special.

"This is probably one of the greatest shows that I have ever seen. But, this is not a show that you should be considering to watch as one of your first ten anime series. This show should be something that you are wanting to watch because everyone says it's good and you have probably already been watching anime for about a year. I will mention this again ""This is a great show"" but it deserves a huge amount of commitment and your attention. With its current 832 episode marker, you should not treat this as a walk in the park. I was able to start and catch up in about 6 months but, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Take your time. If something catches your eye you can keep watching but it isn't something that I would recommend just to get your episode count up. Again, ""This is a great show"" and if you are just watching it because you have nothing else to watch and you aren't giving you're utmost attention to the show then forget it, it isn't worth your time. That said I would recommend this show to anyone that likes adventure shows and things like Dragon Ball and Fairy Tail. Also, THIS IS A BIG TIP. If you have stopped watching One Piece because you don't like the art style, you don't find it interesting, and you are only about 60 episodes in. I can't stress this enough KEEP WATCHING. That is when the show gets good and if you are stopping there then you are missing all of the good parts of the series that come later. There is also something else that I totally recommend doing. Skip from episodes 152-196. This is probably the most boring arc of a series that I have ever watched. It is on par with the Key of the Starry Sky arc from Fairy Tail. If you watch this One Piece arc you are sure to stop the show. It is a guarantee. It is that bad. However, if you are that person who wants to see all of a show because they want to talk to their friends about the series that they have seen all of. I promise you it isn't worth it. Of the 6 months that I mentioned earlier that it took me to catch up one and a half of them were me just watching other things because I was stuck at that arc and I wasn't advancing. I am not saying don't watch it I am just stating that it might be something that you don't necessarily want to watch. The third and final thing that I am going to mention about One Piece is the opening songs. These opening songs are probably some of the best that there are in shows. All though very rarely do they relate to the plot in the actual visuals, the songs are on point. I have most of them downloaded on Spotify and I can't even tell you how many times I have listened to these songs. They are amazingly good. But I have to warn you. Around the 400 episodes, they have the Toei Animation opening sequence. You might get into a habit of just skipping the whole opening and the recap which is fine but watch out for one thing. While I was watching I got into the habit of skipping the song but I never checked the songs that I was skipping so it turned out that I had skipped two of the openings that I didn't know about. So my advice to you is that you should at least check what you are skipping at least once every 20 episodes. That is really helpful and makes sure that you know about all the openings that are coming up, and you never know you might actually enjoy some of them. So, in conclusion, you should really consider watching this show and if you don't like it, No big deal but just letting you know there are no other shows like this out there.",10,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1143675d5b,24,3489
"SPOILER FREE REVIEW One Piece is, in a word, perfect. Just perfect. Honestly, I was a bit reluctant to watch it at first because, to me, a story about a boy wanting to become ""Pirate King"" sounded so bland, cliche and overall boring, and the art style was a bit too old-school for my liking, but I was dead wrong! There is nothing boring about it. I find that a lot of people complain about the length, or the art, or whatever, but the thing is, once I really got into One Piece, I just completely forgot about the art style and the length and focused on the anime itself. By the way, the animation EVENTUALLY improves... eventually. I'd also like to discuss Luffy, the main character. I love how the stereotypical “protagonist” is just thrown out the window when it comes to Luffy. What you need to know about Luffy is that no, he is not a hero. Yes, he admits that he admires heroes, but he certainly doesn't wanna be one. Simply put, he’s a pirate. He seeks freedom and doesn’t give a damn about Justice. I guess that's one of the things I found most enjoyable; you can just get submerged in the Straw Hat’s adventure’s as if you yourself are also there laughing, having fun, or even crying with them. I just love the interactions between the crew members, (especially Sanji and Zoro) as well as just the characters themselves. Everyone in the anime is unique and have there own little quirks to them, and, seeing how absolutely massive the world of One Piece is, Eiichiro Oda certainly did a fantastic job. Also, the balance between action and humour is definitely worth mentioning. I could go on and on about how great this is, for like forever, but I don't think you wanna read that. Anyways, if you haven't watched One Piece, you really are missing out because I can say honestly and without any hesitation whatsoever that One Piece is one of those few anime which can truly be considered as a ""Master Piece"".",10,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdaa01fab0,24,1916
"One Piece .... My favorite Anime of all time. Here in this review let me tell you why. Firstly One Piece might look like your typical kind of Shonen but no! One Piece is very unique in many ways like a character's laughter, different kind of race/type of people in the OP Universe, how characters from an episode are link to future episodes or having a background which connects to the past. Oda-sensei(The Mangaka) doesn't ""throw away"" characters he made even though its a minor role. These minor role characters will be appearing or being thought of again in the series. Oda-sensei is just that good in character development! Almost every episode of One Piece is important and if you miss 1 or 2 episodes, you are actually missing quite a lot. One Piece is an Anime which you must never underestimate it because if you were to sit down and really think about it, One Piece is actually a very very deep series. Story Rating: 9/10 Character's art and animation ... Well, the earlier episodes of One Piece definitely looks old and of course not HD(But I think there's a remake of the earlier episodes? Which was made in HD). But that doesn't matter. As you watch on, the art gets better and better. Not really something to be bothered with. As for the animation, sometimes it is quite bad but usually happens in those unimportant scenes. Art/Animation Rating: 8/10 For the Sound, its good which I'll rate it 9/10. So in overall, such a long Anime definitely might get boring at certain parts due to history talking or draggy scenes but fret not, those are still important because almost everything in One Piece are linked.

"One Piece started airing in 1999 and has been airing non-stop ever since then. It has reached over 700 episodes, and the animation hasn't been top-notch ever since around the time-skip. But, there are better things about One Piece that aren't about the animation and... well, the length of One Piece is the least thing I worry about. If you really like the show, and enjoyed it, like I did, I finished it in around 2 months, and am now bored and don't know what to watch. It's not that I don't know what to, I'm not really motivated to watch anything right now. Gol D. Roger was known as the Pirate King who was the strongest pirate who ruled the seas. Well, I don't have to explain this, because the page of MAL says it, so explaining it is kind of useless. Although this is the main story, it branches off into several characters stories, who have their own kind of backstory. Luffy's is shown in the first couple of episodes, and re-shown after the Marineford arc, what really happened. Zoro is also shown within the first 20 episodes... well, I ain't sitting here explaining which backstories were shown in which episodes. But, the story keeps on going and going which is my favourite part about One Piece. The animation and art-style... It ain't the greatest thing in existence. But, unlike other people, I frankly don't give a shit. I franky don't give a shit. Ha! Nah, sorry, I'll kill myself right now. Anyway, I don't care for the animation and art-style as long as the content is still good. I can watch things with not-so-good animation and art-style as long as the story and content of it is good. The soundtrack is my second favourite thing about One Piece. I think it's second. Well, anyway, I like how a scene you try not to bawl your eyes out in, and you're succeeding... until.... SAD MUSIC SLASH! Yeah, this is basically what happens. And then they kill you. The characters, third favourite. I have a lot of favourite things about this anime. I like sometimes how they re-use voice actors for different characters in the series. It's easier than finding new people, so I kind of see why they do this. The character development though, is so good. It makes Boku no- Not the best example, so I won't say anything. I enjoyed this anime a lot. I didn't start watching it a lot until the Enies Lobby arc (late 200s and early 300s) and it wasn't the greatest series before then. But, after that moment, I started watching the anime a lot, every day even. I ain't a serious anime watcher or reviewer, so I can't judge an anime better than someone that actually lives off of this. But one thing I can say is, this anime is great. If you're planning to watch it, don't stop before at least Arlong Park. If you still don't like it at Arlong Park... well... try to get to Alabasta at least. It's one of the first big arcs, and Alabasta features one of the first main villains to ever appear. So, don't back down from the first couple of episodes. Continue. Continue. Watch it all... ...or just read the manga.",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2d3bbf0a3a,24,3016

"I really took me a while to start watching One Piece, I was too lazy for is a very long anime !! But something inside me stirred up the desire to sail the seas of One Piece. If you are thinking how I was, take a chance to One Piece, I believe you will certainly want to embark with Monkey D. Luffy in the most incredible adventures the Grand Line to search for the legendary treasure One Piece. But first, Luffy looking for a crew, and you will be enchanted with each new member. From beginning we are introduced to each of them, their life stories and especially their dreams. It is interesting how the dreams of each connect in a peculiar way to Luffy, causing them to unite on an incredible journey. Gradually the gang is being formed and coming together like a puzzle. And speaking in the troop, I admire the way in One Peice explore friendship and companionship. More than how members of a family, each fighting the other, they take their pain, give the blood to protect his companion as hard as it may seem the battle. As captain, Luffy is what more worries about your nakamas! The straw hat gang face harsh battles along the journey. Many ruthless enemies crossing your way some of them stand out for me as Arlong, Crocodile, Enel and of course the World Government are the most terrible so far. Of course, not everything is made of hard battles! One Piece always finds a way to start a good laugh, often starring Luffy, Usopp and Chopper, who do mischief on the ship during the trips. While all is quiet and its nakamas are fine, Luffy not worry about anything except food! What many times does look like he is not captain. One Piece also take many tears of our hearts! Some of our gang have stories really suffered as Nami and Robin. But as I said Luffy always take the pain of your friends and fight for them to the end. One Piece has a wonderful soundtrack, to remember the older animes. Art can seem strange at first, but you get used quickly.

"Pre timeskip (1-516) is good, especially the last half of it is outstanding and definitely the reason you should try watching this show. One Piece has incredible worldbuilding and great stories to tell, but fights may not come as often as some would like and early on may feel childish to turn newcomers off. Even some of the fights in this show may fall short. Regardless I can promise that this show has some unforgettable moments and characters. Post timeskip (517-?) however is something that I don't consider worth getting into unless you are interested in following the story to the end. Yes, the show will still have great stories, moments, and characters to introduce, as well as more lore, but it has multiple flaws: 1. The arcs are bigger than before, this also means that the Strawhat Crew which I personally grew to love gets less spotlight while dozens of side characters get time to shine. Some strawhats especially start to feel useless, and their growth as characters definitely dulls down. 2. Overall pacing and animation quality seems to struggle. The episodes feel more stretched out than before and can be quite the struggle to go through. 3. The show starts to be somewhat repetitive with it's narrative. - Regardless, if you enjoy the show it's most likely worth going through.",7,Recommended,"Jun 19, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1e9b231c0c,24,1299
"This review can contain spolliers(I'll try my best to not to give any) and spelling mistakes(My native language isn't english). I've dropped this anime 3 times in its beginning, and today it's one of my favorites, so I decided to do this review so people can have patience and take advantage of this great work. Let's started with the story (10/10) - The story it's simple by the began, but having the novelty of the main character isn't but the traditional hero always, telling the story of an outlaw pirate(Luffy) and the pursuit of his dream of becoming the king of pirates. In this anime Luffy has a goal, different from many other anime, several times you will hear the main character scream '' I'm gonna become King Of the Pirates'' like Naruto scream ''I will become Hokage''. This is not something negative since with a goal already in mind the anime doesn't create much content that hasn't connection with the main objective, this making the anime more ''fast'', I just remember of 4 episodes fillers in +700. But of course nothing is perfect and certain episodes try to delay the story a lot, especially in the saga Dressrosa, in which there are many repeated scenes, such as scenes where people show often running in the same episode. This anime takes a while to get interesting, to get an idea I dropped it about 3 times at its beginning, where the fights can't get my attention and I was surprising very the different traits, mainly in the eyes of the characters. It took me until episode 70 to start really taking advantage of. But after that Eiichiro Oda manages to create a whole new world(literally, lol), with a very well made plot and organizations that have their secrets or their particular goals and all this can have connection with the main characters, becoming more and more an unforeseeable anime. Art (9/10) - As I had said, the art and ''lines, dashes'' of the characters is very different from ordinary. At first I thought it was horrible, but I easily got used to it and many of the characters I consider to be one of the most creative and beautiful to see. But it really took me a while to get used to Usopp, being one of the most different characters in appearance. And to think that today he is considered ''God Usoop''... (not spolier, I swear). It is also good to say that throughout the anime the art improves a lot in all aspects, only I not liking the change in Robin. Sound (10/10) - Great music, especially in action scenes. My favorite is ''The very, very, very strongest''. I don't know much what to comment more here, so let's go to the next one. Character (10/10) - All characters are unique, both in design and in personality. Luffy looks a bit ''baka'' too much, but that makes it all very funny, and when he gets angry the only thing you think is: ''woohaaa Luffy will get him''. My favorite one is Zoro, he's the best... He's like Vegeta but even better... lol, but it's truth. This anime hasn't only 1 main, throughout the story more and more characters are highlighting and catching our attention, but of course that focuses more on Luffy... Also has a great prominence for main characters, several times you will get totally annoyed with them. Even villains who don't possess grandiose powers are able to make us angry with their very exentric personalities. There are so many great characters in this anime that if I were to quote everyone I would write for 3 days and I could tell spoliers unintentionally , so I'll just say that and go to the next one. Enjoyment (10/10) - You will enjoy every moment watching this anime, but it's important to have patience especially at the beginning of it, but it will be worth every second that you spend watching. Honestly I delayed to start this anime because of the large number of episodes that it has, but before long I watched so many episodes that I easily reached the current episodes and still hoping that this incredible anime takes a long time to finish. Overall (10/10) - This anime is incredible, is it Master Piece in all aspects, mainly in story... So the only thing I say to you that has read all this review is: please be patient with the beginning of the anime that in the end you will be inspired by this great work of Eiichiro Oda.",10,Recommended,"May 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8e03116d4e,24,4242
"Awesome and long. Long enough to take up your whole summer if you start from the start but tasteful enough to make it worth it. If the sheer number of episodes scare you from starting to watch this anime then don't worry, if you skip the intro theme song and recap each episode can be done in 15-20 mins. this anime is all about a character named Luffy who starts of as a weak nobody gathering friends along the way who help him achieve his dream while trying to accomplish their personal goals. The character development for each and every character doesn't seem to stop which is awesome for such a long anime and even some of the enemies and acquaintances keep getting stronger (not spoiling much :P).

"""The beautiful depth of the story itself compensates for the drag of this anime..."" okay Im not going to write a review on every little aspect and detail. Rather I do want to highlight the negative side of this anime because there is only few that bugs me. If dealt with then I believe it could be the most amazing anime of all time. My biggest pet peeves with this anime are mainly two things. 1) the DRAG. Seriously the last anime that I thought was a drag was Dragonball Z. Seriously One Piece takes 1/4 of your entire episode on the starting theme song and the ""previously on One Piece"". THus I always fast forward to the 4-5mn mark to start watching. Also they spend another good 1/4 of the anime on slow walking characters, slow reactions, to slow opening doors, to replayed movements. Its hilariously dragged out. HOWEVER i get it! they are pumping out episodes non stop since 1999 on top of movie specials, and special eps. I get it, its probably how the people in the studio cope with it. But still, it drives me insane. THats why I always binge watch One Piece. Once a year during Christmas holidays I watch around 50 episodes. BUT F*CK ME! even with a year worth of episodes its only like 1 week into the actual story line. 2) Another pet peeve is the character of Luffy. YEs you heard me, the main character, the indestructible, loved by all, Monkey f*cking D Luffy. Dont get me wrong, do i like the character? absolutely. But he pisses me off because of his character and personality. YEs at first i enjoyed his irrational, free spirited, careless fearless personality, but that goes into some extent. With every crisis that arrises because of Luffys immaturity alot of ppl suffer. But ofcourse its an anime so it all works out in the end, so i dont mind it. However what I do mind is the fact that he just doesnt grow up nor learn from his mistakes. Hes the same luffy from ep 1. Sure he learnt new skills, and broaden his boundaries. But his major maturity level, of dealing with situation hasnt changed. If he knows his rash decisions or irrational behaviours have caused many people to stumble then like any other human being he should be able to learn from it. Thus I find him selfish in that sense. But the irony is he is portrayed as the most selfless character who is willing to die for his friends, which is the cause of his vast popularity. But my major argument is simply, hes selfish in the sense of not having the self control in his lack of maturity. like any other decent human they should be able to grow and mature. But I think he hasnt. But I understand without this side of him the anime wouldnt be as adventurist as it is, which we all known to love. Overall its still an amazing anime, but this is just my honest opinion.",8,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4105e03d24,24,2755
"I am frustrated with how this anime is turning out. Up till the big mom arc the series was good. The dresroa arc is great, Big mom was fine but then came the long anticepated Wano. This is where this anime officialy crumbles in my eyes. From here on out every character turns into pure cringe. THe scipts of the characters is written like a 5 years old. Oda lost his writing skill and his ability to tell a story. Its sad but true. Watchign through Wano is just frustrating. Wano is pure and utter trash. The way characters are pictured even those do not hold up any longer. When Kin nemontells the story of Odin you see Luffy lash out and not stuffing his face. Up till now Luffy never cared about the background, he just wanted to help. The way he lashes out and Nami and the others react is just so cringe. The way they show it shows its just filler on the screen to strech out the episode. Oda no longer respects his readers and viewers. He hjas no respect his fans either. As soon as the arc startsyou get 2 episodes after that 2 filler episodes. Great start Oda how dare you do that. Then as it all progresses it just goes down hill. THe time traveling is crap. Don't touch something you can not do. Time travel is difficult to get right and Oda completely missed the mark. Momonoske is the most annoying character ever made. Its like Ussop 2.0 pure crap. Ussop is a waste of space aswell. He never learns and only a few times gets brave but is still the same character he was since the start. He never grew a pair. The intro song is nice its an improvement. The art is just the same as always. The story became a pile of smelling shit. The characters are bad. Monlogs are written by a 5 year old. Just lay down the pen or relearn yourself how to tell a story and how to create the characters. I had the aniem rated around an 8. Wano alone makes me drop this number to a 1. THat is how bad Wano is. The anime and the manga should have ended after the big mom arc i gues.",1,Not Recommended,"Feb 11, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_dd3feb5124,24,1976
"This review will be undeniably biased! ""I believe that no matter how old we grow and mature we get, we will always have that child inside us"" and ONE PIECE is the that woke mine. Of course, just like other anime, this one is probably not for everyone as we have our own different taste of genre. This anime requires time and commitment to be able to understand the whole story. First with the brilliant Author, I myself is a huge fan of Fairy Tail (Mashima Hiro) and Naruto (Kishimoto Masashi) they are my top three! but I still believe that Eiichiro Oda is the best among all of them because until now I can't still figure out how he does such amazing plot twist throughout the story and the fact that the ENDING has already been laid out and so much has already happened yet the ending remains unchanging is just too brilliant. Second, Toei production! This anime has been following the manga and there has to be a gap between the latest chapter and episode. Therefore, the time comes when one anime has to make a filler but when one piece has to make one they are still able to connect it with the flow of the series and that's what makes them amazing. The first episode has an old animation since technology has not been developed at that time but now they create this amazing design and animation. Thrid, Characters 9 members! namely, LUFFY, ZORO, NAMI, USOPP, SANJI, CHOPPER, ROBIN, FRANKY, and BROOK! these nine characters are the one that brings joy in the series the bond and loyalty of these people are truly remarkable. All of them have gone through painful childhood and LUFFY the captain of the crew has made a huge impact in their life and made them capable of changing to reach their individual dreams. Luffy's faith to the crew is one of the most amazing things for me, ""betrayal"" may come but he himself (instinct basically) knows that there is a reason why one member can act that way and of course he is right. Every saga introduced a new character and all of them comes with a sad story which touches the viewer's life and can truly bring you learnings! Fourth, STORY! as I said ODA truthfully is one brilliant mangaka/author. The whole series is full of plot twists and emotions. as I mentioned every saga and arc introduce a new character and all of them comes with a shocking plot twist. There will be times when something is mentioned in the beginning of the episode but we will only get the explanation in the middle of the story. OVERALL THERE'S SO MUCH PLOT TWISTS AND EXPLANATION ODA NEEDS TO LAY OUT TO HIS READERS! SO MUCH ENJOYMENT, EXCITEMENT, AND THINGS TO LOOK FORWARD TO! A NEVER BORING ANIME! This anime is a roller coaster and of course, this is beyond 10 for me in comes of ratings! I recommend this manga/anime to people who can truly commit and can give time since it has currently 867 chapters and 791 episodes (I am following both manga and anime)!",10,Recommended,"Jun 6, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9443a0d52a,24,2890
"First thing I like about one piece is the world, never seen a world like that, and believe me i watched a lot of anime, the story just gets bigger every second, whenever you say it's close to the end, Oda just be like here more worlds here more islands here more genders here shichibukai ..etc, but all arcs are just too repetitive, you know what is going to happen whenever each arc stars. Luffy goes to this village or town or island, finds problems, sees either a small kid or a cute and beautiful female, she asks him for help while crying and luffy helps her and makes that area full of peace and stuff, and at the end he calls himself a fucking pirate, the fuck that ain't a pirate i'd call that a sailor or something, First time i see a pirate bringing peace and stuff, the marine are just chilling they have no job to do luffy will bring peace and do all the stuff, no and the problem is that after he does that they just make his bounty higher lel. talking about bounties, at the start of one piece it was something cool and it like had a good taste, with time going it just became something that shows how strong this character is, it became something like we need to rate the charatcters strength with his bounty, which i think is something stupid, dude teech's bounty was 0 at a time don't fuck with me, Yea teech. He is the real pirate, he is the one who will be the pirate king, if Oda really does it and makes Teech get the one piece then luffy fights him and takes it from him it's gonna be fire. Only scary thing is that if one piece turns out to be the power of friendship, i won't care cause i won't even watch it's ending but god damn i'll laugh so fucking loud at the fans. One piece art and character designs, I have a big problem with them I don't know why, Oda can draw some cool looking characters, Proof for that is luffy's crew, well that's if we exclude franky with his short ass pants, Usopp's long ass nose, also chopper, and sanji's eyebrow, and goddamn that whole crew looks like shit except for nami and robin. For real tho characters like Shanks and Mihok-, never mind Mihok's chit chats and his mustache are just irretating, You feel like he is telling you fill in the empty space. Characters like Marco, Kid, Law and others, well probably not much others. Then fucking Oda comes with his cringeness and draws some characters that make you want to puke 10 times without water breaks, like the 7th shichibukai and his mother that acts like shirohige's wife, characters like franky with his short ass pants that opens his stomach to drink coke and give him power, Raizo the Ninja, more like the dumb fuck, was something i wanted to see since hes talks were there a while before, now he looks like this bruh, how does that look like a fucking ninja, don't get me wrong It's not like I want him to draw beautiful and cute and kawaii characters and doki doki and shit, no no this is a pirate world, draw some characters like teech, shirohige except for his big mustache. Devil fruits in one piece, in one piece it's kind of different in the way of getting powers and stuff, let's say in other animes, characters can get stronger by shouting at the top of their lungs, others need to eat a piece of hair, others you just have to become bold to be strong, and don't make me talk about the anime that made the character become strong cuz he found a notebook, well in one piece, you just have to go to the vegetable market to be strong, ok well you eat that devil's fruit and you get a special power, three kinds of devil's fruits : paramecia and it is anything in life, can make you gomu gomu, can make bring you back to life, can turn you into a human if you are not one (looking at chopper) can turn you into a doctor, basically anything. Logia gives you nature elements, lava water ice fire shit stuff you know, then Oda once was drunk I guess and said katakori's is a Logia, then he got sober and changed it and said it's a special kind of paramecia (wow i can't believe i remember this much). Then there is zone, which basically turns you into an anime, I am tring to find a better way to say it but I can't find any, you can literally become a dog, or a dragon... OH RIGHT how did I almost forget, eating these fruits makes you unable to swim, so you become a pirate that can't swim, same thing as a butterfly without her wings, a car without tires, Anime time without cringe. Devil fruit were everything at the first of one piece, like it's the one with the strongest one is the strongest, but then with the haki getting introduced, I just learned to see them as a small power up and the haki is everything, hearing that the pirate king didn't have any fruit and just used haki is enough The main characters which are our crew that look kind of cursed, well a lot cursed which are Luffy the captain, zoro that needs a compass, Sanji the cook, Usopp the sniper, Nami the beautifu- navigator, Chopper the doctor, Short pants mf the carpenter or the blacksmith idk, Robin the... yeah I think a scientist and the singer brook my favorite in all the crew. over all that we have the real main character, best character without any doubt, the mother of dragons, the best doctor, the next hokage in the magic kingdom in the clover kingdom, who else other than Trafalgar D.Water Law, best character in one piece. talking about the best we can't forget the celestial dragons, they are just too nice and good, they choose others before themself, soo keen and lovely and suitable to rule the world. also the fuck is a talking ship? the crew crying when they are burning it and the ship talking saying "" don't cry guys don't worry"" ???? bitch you should be saying ouch it's hot The marine's soldiers are just for numbers and no one can disagree, just sheep walking around holding guns that are as useless as nerf guns or water guns, and they need someone who guides them which is usally the admiral, even for the pirates lol it's like this crew has 5000 crew members and this one 6000 and this one shit then luffy with his 6 or 7 crew members just come and beat the shit out of all of them. it's something like : this guy has 5000 crew members? remove three zero's and you will get how many real members are there, others are just to make the number larger Another thing I like in one piece is that there is no romance, yea not needed here just leave romance for naruto and sakura telling him I love you then he just ignores her, but honestly, there is no romance in one piece to the point where the fans became dry dude they just see nami hugging luffy and they be like SHIP SHIP I SHIP THEM SHE LOVES HIM, I remember seeing someone shipping Robin with Zoro, a 30yo with a teenager, lel imagine at the end of the anime it's like naruto or something where we find luffy and nami married and franky and robin and usopp marries chopper- and all that shit, but no problem cuz I won't even see that and the anime would be ending so meh, then Oda be like sike here is one piece shippuden In one piece there are a lot of races and stuff as I said, but there is one race that is just a punching box, nothing else just to show how powerful other characters are, a race that I don't remember seeing any strong character from, yeap it's the giants, useless trash punching boxes, lmao they just get deleted by characters that are same size as their fingers, then there is this one giant that wears a skirt and says don't look below it, also there is another punching bag in one piece, a character that is supposed to be strong and used to be strong and he has a strong fruit, now there is no character that didn't punch his face and make fun of him, a character that was super strong in the grand line and he went to the new world and he got yeeted, it's smoker-chan. back in the day when he got luffy and no-one else other than dragon came to save him Just how long Oda is planning to make it wtf like every 10 episodes you can just recap them in one 20min episode or yea we have to see luffy running after flamingo for 77 episodes just to fight him, and just in case we forget who is luffy chasing he just screams MINGOOOO. My favorite characters are teech brook and law, worst characters are smoker-chan and the 7th shichibukai and his mom and all the marine ships Fruits, the best one, of course, is the best fruit for the best character, Law's Small talks about the arcs cuz this shit is soo fucking long, I love the first arcs like west blue where they all meet and stuff, arabsta arc also is good, skypiea is too bad I skipped it, don't like the water city much, I like Thriller bark cuz of it's comedia, I don't like the amazone lily too but I might rethink about it cuz all of them are cute gir-, and don't want to see that the paramount war arc is the best cuz it's obvious, punk hazard the trash and dressrosa the two trashes, if it wasn't for flamingo there it would've been something impossible to watch, The big mom's arc and her cake is terrible except for katakori and him beating luffy for 12 episodes straight, and then now wano arc which is still going and it is not interesting at all You probably won't read all of this shit cuz I know it's fucking long but in summary I wanted to say that I enjoyed some of the time I was watching one piece, It took me 5 months to finish it, let's say I enjoyed 10 hours of that lol, I regret wasting my time in this and I won't be following it unless people say it is getting a lot better.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 28, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4cfd032a01,24,9456
"I love the One Piece lore, but the anime... It's a chore. I've been watching it at 1.25x since around post-time skip; the pacing is absolutely horrid due to how it's scheduled compared to the manga. Some people may be able to tolerate it, but after 1000+ episodes I feel like I'm wasting my time re-watching stuff at each episode. The animation can be really great in some important episodes, but even in those the problem is jarring. A perfect example is ep1027. So what now? I've decided that after the end of the Wano Arc, I'm going to read the manga and only watch fan-cut episodes (like the One Pace project). It is a bad anime? No. Would I recommend it? Pre-time skip absolutely, afterwards just read the manga. Also, here's a breakdown of a typical One Piece episode: 2 mins opening 1 min recap 30s eyecatch 30s next episode tease 2.5mins stuff that happened in the previous episodes 3mins of still frames panning and zooming with nothing happening 1.5mins of reused frames 1min of added dialogue that consists of screaming and meaningless stuff like ""we'll see"", ""I'll kick your butt"", ""I'll defeat you"" 2min of running around and generically punching random fodder 10mins of actual episode that could be 10% faster My rating of One Piece: 10 My rating of the anime: ↓↓↓",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 20, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1406b7a199,24,1278
I will keep it short. This anime test you peacence its so slow that you will start getting irritated. Its story is also same in most of the arcs. And when it comes to luffy he is irritating and as for side characters you will find girl with same setup and personality in every arc. Its just getting milked. And guys the power scaling this world suck you will see a character doing incredible thing and flexing (that is cring most the times) but for stretching the story the first villain beats the hero then hero gets up and wins.bro the fights are so stretched that you start getting annoying they just unnecessarily stretches the fight for no reason.

"Spoilers ahead!! It’s my first time when I write a review for an anime so I hope it will be ok. I’m going to divide this review in more pieces, each pieces focusing on a central aspect. 1. World-building(10/10) One Piece has one of the best built world in the history of animes. It explores everything you want to know. You have the Marine, which is structured from : The 5 Elders, Fleet Admiral, Admirals, Vice-Admirals,etc. Than you have the pirates, revolutionary army, bounty hunters, cp 0 – 9 ( secret police) . The map of the world, you can clearly see how the One Piece world looks like ( the 4 seas, red-line forming the grand-line) – with the New World and Grand-Line( first section). Every aspect of the story is pretty much explored and you have a general idea on how the One Piece world looks like. The power system is pretty basic ( devil fruits), but in exchange some of the fruits have really interesting power and potential ( mitical zoan fruits/ancient/special paramecia,etc). The haki system is pretty boring excepting the conqueror haki which I find very interesting and have a lot of potential to develop in the future. 2. Characters (10/10) I know, I know, One piece doesn’t have a lot of character development over the time and the characters remain pretty much the same (for example Luffy personality and mindset remains the same from the beginning of the story). But what makes Luffy such a good mc is the fact that he is an enjoyable character. One Piece is very good at making background for the characters ( by this I mean the backstories). They all have very interesting background with the saddest backstories I have ever seen. The One Piece backstories are just something different man. The connections and the relationships between the characters are very well written while the story develops. I find Luffy to be a character that doesn’t really develops over time ( except when his brother decides to open a donut shop and he realizes he’s too weak to protect his nakama). Instead, Luffy helps other characters to develop ( Katakuri, Sanji, Robin, Nami, etc). And it’s not the Naruto type character that uses Talk No Jutsu to change other people mindset. I like to think that Naruto speaks and Luffy takes action. Anyways, this is not a Luffy character review, but the idea is that Oda knows how to make characters enjoyable and unique in their own way, and I like this. 3. Pacing (1/10) To be clear, I am talking know about the anime, not the manga. The pacing is shit. That’s all. 4. Art style (9/10) The One Piece art style is very unique, every single character having a unique new feature, making them so different. It’s very fitting for the series, giving it this adventurous vibe because you always find new original characters( except for girls, they all fucking have Nami face, and I’m not gonna talk about Big Mom). 5. Animation (8/10) If we only consider the animation until the beginning of the Whole Cake Island Arc, it will be like a 6-7, but from WC is starts improving drastically. Camera angles, lights, character’s action and movements and overall style of animation got better. The Wano Arc has a very clean and cool animation and One Piece finally got what it deserved. 6. Storytelling(10/10) Eiichiro Oda is an amazing storyteller. Foreshadows, character arcs, symbolism, problems and conflicts from the current society ( corruption, discrimination, jobbery, false appearance over realistic self, human meat market, slavery, child abuse, etc), all of this gives the story a fiction look, but in the same time a realistic one, being in a way inspired from the real world. The story is amazing, with a lot of mysteries and questions from the fans around the world. Lots of theories have been made in the last couple of years. 7. Overall – Objective (8/10) Subjective(10/10) This is the only anime that made me think more about what the author wanted to say with that scene/quote. I know I am biased but for me One Piece is 10/10 anime and I can’t wait to see how the story develops and it’s ending (if it’s going to exist one).",10,Recommended,"Sep 5, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdf42f2f75,24,4078

And as you go on watching it the storyline will get better Animation and pacing (6/10) When it comes to animation toei kinda ruined it however it gets better in further episodes but unfortunately the pacing of this anime never got better another reason why people hate this anime is its pacing so i recommend manga Characters (10/10) There are lot of characters in one piece and every character is useful unlike some animes out there where most characters are totally useless and i like how no characters are forgotten whether its a side character or a annoying antagonist Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed everything about it the storytelling, world building etc. But again the pacing is really bad especially when you catch up with it Overall (9/10) -1 because of the pacing XD (btw its worth watching however i recommend manga)",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fdaac80b73,24,1091
"I always brushed one piece off as a weird looking show with a strange hat boi as an mc. I didn’t decide to give it a try until my friend told me he watched over 500 episodes and never got bored. I decided to give a watch and immediately was hooked in with Luffy’s smile And charisma. At a first glance I’ll admit it, the characters in one piece look really strange. But once you learn of the past and story’s it immediately changes the way you see them and you can see how Oda get better and better at doing this as the series progresses. An example could be Zoro. Zoro seems like a street rat that uses 3 swords for whatever reason but until you learn about how he got stuck bounty hunting and his past with Kuina your perception of him really does change. The world that one piece is set in is one of the stupidest but also the smartest. I say this because there are so many places or islands that have a fully functional Government but when it comes to looks it just goes all over the place but I think this is what keeps me so interested in this world. With every new area you discover it fells like a breath of fresh air from the last place. This really helps you stay hooked and invested in the worlds setting. Overall I would say one piece is one of the best shows I have experienced. From its happy look to its sometimes heartbreaking back stories. This show stays consistently good throughout the majority of the series and kept me flipping pages and watch episode after episode.",10,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d31a6e99d8,24,1488
"One Piece is an amazing anime, in terms of world-building, character development and it is filled with a very deep storyline. It contains awesome action, adventures, comedic moments. It is long because it builds up the world of One Piece and its characters and you can look back on how far they have all come from once it all ends. There are so many great things to look back to at every arc which always makes One Piece very interesting. There are hundreds of characters who are all interesting and have their own backstories. The adventures that the main characters go to are always intriguing such as fighting new enemies, meeting new friends, exploring the world, and stumbling upon new mysteries. The One Piece mysteries always have fans coming up with their own theories, but Oda has planned it all from the very beginning and gives the audience some clue by using foreshadowing. The world of One Piece shows us every human can be good or evil such as pirates can be good and help people and navy soldiers can be evil and corrupt. Every villain has their own sets of ideas and backstories to the world, and all have unique fighting styles. The protagonists being the Straw Hat Pirates all have their own dreams and goals. Every member has their own way of excelling in a fight. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but they are all useful to the overall story. Some members are extremely strong physically and can fight very well but not as strong mentally, while others are geniuses but don't possess monstrous physical strengths. All the members are lovable each having their own interesting and sad backstories which lead to them pursuing their own dreams while helping Luffy to become the Pirate King and finding One Piece. The supporting characters of each arc all get their chance to shine, no one seems to be left out in the story, they all have a part to play in the overall outcome. I'd say Oda is a genius for creating One Piece and Luffy as its protagonist who is both extremely strong, funny, and interesting. Luffy's fighting style is so creative and versatile because he has the powers of rubber man. It always comes in handy in a fight or almost any given situation. Luffy will always find a way to win fights using his creative rubber powers, extremely strong will and keen intellect in battles. The soundtrack and music in the opening and ending are also awe-inspiring which gives out so many emotions to the series. The animation has been well done considering is an older anime, the art style is unique and different from other shows where Oda draws creatures possessing all sorts of forms. I personally really love Oda’s art style which gives every character its beauty both female and male characters. Finally, the show gave me the most emotions through its long journey. I have felt excitement, happiness, sadness, and anger throughout the whole series through its character, battles, emotional scenes, soundtrack. I have never cried so much for an anime and there are countless emotional and beautiful moments in One Piece.

"One Piece is an adventure, and its a very straightforward one, One Piece proves you don't need very complex plot to be good, it has a lot of memorable moments and until now the story is still good and thank Oda for that. However the pacing is what really kills me the most, especially on newer episodes where the pacing is slow as snails since they can't outpace the manga, Usually slower pacing isn't a killer except its on anime that's on 1000 episodes and could have easily been a hundred of episodes shorter if it wasn't for the bad pacing they've been doing. By all means, this is a preference, you'll still enjoy the most of it early on without worrying about the bad pacing too much but you'll definitely notice it later on.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 27, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_db7a98e014,25,731
"Let’s talk about One Piece. Now, why would anyone in their right mind watch, as of this review, 588 episodes -- 8 days of their life (if you watch 24 hours a day) -- on one anime which shows no signs of ending anytime in the next 10 years? In my humble opinion: because One Piece is the paramount serial anime series on the planet. I cannot imagine any other series captivating my attention from the first episode and holding it for so long. There are always new and exciting things to discover, and the stories of each crew member will make you love them for all eternity. Other crew members aside, Luffy is the reason this show is so amazing; he is the greatest main character in any series. His funny and light attitude makes the show enormously entertaining, and it contrasts and intensifies his strong emotions when he truly gets serious. Of course, the fight scenes are amazing and seeing new devil’s fruits or new techniques (especially some around the halfway mark :D ), will make your heart soar with excitement. The way that Oda (writer of the original manga) has created a world where the crew can go into any environment and find any enemy with any power, while still progressing the story, is complete genius. I have laughed, cried and jumped for joy while watching this show and I won’t be stopping anytime soon. But beware; once you start you won’t be able to stop.

"One Piece is an excellent show. It's exceedingly funny and I guarantee that you will laugh. The main characters are so weird and insane that you immediately love them. First there's Monkey D. Luffy, who is this optimistic boy that can stretch his body thanks to a Gum-Gum fruit he ate as a child. He's the captain. Then there's the sarcastic sword master, Roronoa Zolo, who practices santoryu, which means he uses three swords at once. He is the first mate. Nami is the third member to join the crew. She's a thief who hates almost all pirates with a passion, but adores money. She's the navigator. Usopp is the fourth crew member. He's a total scaredy-cat and always tells lies. He's the crew's sharpshooter. The fifth crewman is Sanji, who's a serious ladies' man. He is the cook. And then there's Tony Tony Chopper, who is...a reindeer. He's just a tad shy. He's the crew's doctor. There might be more crew members, but I don't know of any others. They're all really interesting, but the enemies are just absurd. Every time you see a new one you have to stare at it for a minute or so just to figure out whether he's wearing a wig, or if that's REALLY his outfit.

"""What? You still haven't seen One Piece?"" That's the response I always get when meeting fellow anime fans once they ask me about One Piece. And then after that, they'd proceed and tell me reasons why I should watch it now. I know that it's good. I heard a lot of positive reviews about it after all. But what discouraged me from picking it up (which I'm sure might also the reason those who still haven't seen One Piece have no plans to do so) is the number of episodes. It's A LOT and unless you're really dedicated and patient, that won't sit well with you. Well, guess what? The reason why I didn't want to watch it in the first place became the main reason why I love it. I'm so glad I didn't let it discourage me from trying it out! And so, after three months and one week of marathoning this anime, I finally caught up with the latest episode when this review was written which was episode 831. Wow, what a ride. One Piece has everything I love about anime--enthralling world, captivating plot, mind-blowing twists, fascinating and relatable characters, heart-stopping actions, heartbreaking deaths, and more. That's why in no time, One Piece became one of my most favorite anime of all time. Thanks to the huge number of episodes, you can really get attached to the SH crew and other notable characters to the point where you can't imagine life without them. From the first episode, I immediately knew my life was about to change now that I discovered this treasure. The world it offers is really beautiful. The parallels that are compared to real life are just simply brilliant. Don't even get me started with the plot. This plus the plot twists are strengths of One Piece. Every arc will surely get you hooked and after watching an episode, it'll make you want for more. Great characters too. The backstories are relatable and you can really sympathize with them. You'll get attached to them that's why the deaths are really heartbreaking. There was a character's death where it took me three weeks before I had the strength to continue watching the series! That's how in love I am with this anime and not everyone can do that so good job Oda! The actions are great too. There are times when I felt like my heart would stop in suspense. I just wish they'd shorten it though. There were a lot of times where I skipped some scenes because it felt like the animators were just dragging it (which is probably the real case). As for the soundtracks, well it's good but most of the opening and ending songs are forgettable for me. It's not enough to catch my attention and convince me not to skip it. However, there are notable opening songs as well that I didn't skip at all. Overall, One Piece is one of the best anime of all time for me. It deserves all the success and praise it receives! A true classic, indeed. So don't hesitate and just jump right in! You're in for a ride of a lifetime. ;) Story: 10/10 Art: 9/10 Sound: 8/10 Character: 10/10 Enjoyment: 10/10 Overall: 10/10",10,Recommended,"Apr 8, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_18ec74bdce,25,2984
"I'm writing this review as a huge fan of the franchise and it has really special part in my heart. It's been almost 8 years since I've started to series and I'm following the current for 5 years. The most of the negative comments are to anime, not to manga. Story: 9 May be the story of the main characters can't get you but the background story and the connections between events and characters, for me this is the strongest part of the franchise. Pacing is a bit problem in the manga too but in the anime it's ridiculously slow. Generally the ratio of episodes of anime and manga is 1:2 or 1:3 (1 anime episode=2 or 3 manga episodes), but after the time-skip, in One Piece, this ratio becomes 1:1 or even 1:0,5 (yes, 1 anime episdoe=0,5 manga episode). This is the worst point of the anime. Art: 7 Oda was still young when he started to draw the manga, so the art is ""meh"" at the start, but it improves day by day. I wish I could say same about the anime, yes it improves but due to weekly schedule, it is not attentive. Sound: 6 There is few soundtracks that I really liked but most them is just average, I have to say that I really dislike/hate some of the sound effects of the objects or characters. Character: 8 There is 1000+ characters, since the cast is that much, you can easliy find some chacters that you'll like or even love. Enjoyment: 9 As I said before, this franchise is really special for me. I enjoyed almost every moment while watching or reading. But approximately the last 150 episodes (which is during Dressrosa Arc and Whole Cake Island Arc) I really couldn't enjoy because of the excessive filler and empty scenes. It is unavoidale due to weekly schedule of both anime and manga. Overall: 3 Yes I gave high scores for elements but I give overall 3. If you really want to get into the franchise, the best way is manga (personally I recommend colored manga), but anime wasn't bad adaptasion until time-skip event. I recommend you to watch until time-skip (of course you don't have to watch fillers) and then get into manga.",3,Not Recommended,"May 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a2905dc87e,25,2046
"One piece is a weird anime to rate because you can't give all 1000 episodes a single rating. Especially since it downgraded so badly in the last few years. Before the time skip one piece was an absolute master piece, a perfect 10/10 anime with just the perfect amount of action comedy and drama. After the time skip it doesn't even deserve a 4/10, it has a good moment every 50 or so episodes. I truly believe that if it was rated per arc we will see Arabasta, Enies Lobby, White beard war, and some some others in the top rated anime of all time.

Now how wrong was I , well I started watching it ye its really slow at the start, very very slow. But later on it gets amazing. The characters in One Piece are top class, they just are so well developed with such good back stories. On to the actual story its really good well made well plotted, ok there are fillers loads of them but hey these fillers are pretty good. Characters like Smoker Zorro Robbin are all characters who develop excellently through the anime. Art I did not like much at the start, but later on it gets better. Sound is awesome music is awesome some very very tense moments. Enjoyment a full 10 because its so good.

"Ok, my first anime's were naruto, bleach, and d-grayman. I'd always talk to my friends at school about them and debate and discuss plot elements, characters, etc. However, over our senior trip they started talking about an anime they loved very much and praised more than Bleach at times: it was called One Piece. Now, i'm a bleach die-hard fan so when they kept praising this show i kept thinking ""Whats the big deal?"" I'd heard a bit about One Piece but not too much and i thought it was kinda baby compared to bleach or d-grayman. I also heard how long it was which really raised some doubts. I mean c'mon 400+ episodes long!? how can anything even go for a span as long as that?! I thought it was an overestimated, watered down anime, so when i finally began watching it after yu-yu-hakusho mid-summer i had my doubts and didn't expect much. Please permit me to say it now: I AM SO SORRY. I TAKE IT ALL BACK. One Piece is amazing. Period. The characters I found were likable and before you knew it became like a family, true nakama. The humor was greatly done and made me chuckle all the way through. Now the plot did take a bit to pick up with the actual story, but it didnt matter! The individual adventures were enjoyable and did well with pacing themselves out, even if alabastar and skypiea were a bit long. While the animation was kinda rugged in the biggining (which isnt bad at all considering it was 1999) it picked up nicely after skypiea and looked great. Now it wasnt perfect, it was a bit hard to develope a epic atmosphere at times during some of the arcs due to the more humor bases of the anime (ex. zoros fight with the giraffe was mainly goofing off and the big bad guy for chopper was kinda dumb) but it definatley has its epic moments, even more so than other anime. I sitll go back and watch Luffy kick the crap out of Crocodile and be amazing in his fight against Lucci (he will not fall, so epic!) Oh and while we're on Luffy can i say how much of a man he is! i mean when he climbed that huge mountain to save his nakama or the many other amazing things he did, aw man! And the rest of the crew too! ( if i went into it this would go on forever...oh wait too late, sorry) However one of the greatest things this anime has displays is the true meaning of nakama. The scene were nami is stabbing herself and throwing sand at luffy telling him to go way, and then cries and asks for his help. Aw man the hat symbolism, ""You are my nakama i will protect you"" i still go back and watch that. Each adventure showed more an more of the One Piece universe and made me fall in love with the crew more and more. Oh and the length, *ahem* Naruto, Bleach, you two have no right to complain anymore!!!!!! I dont want to hear it about the ""We need more fillers to let the manga get farther"" crap. I thoughtr fillers were there to serve that purpose, until i watched One Piece. 478 episodes and only 40 filler! (AT the most!) And its til way behind the manga from wat ive heard! I dont want to hear it anymore Bleach. (already gave up on naruto anime, read manga) Another great thing about One Piece is that it is very ingenuative. In the early episodes of say, Bleach, the characters had special powers and used them to cunningly beat their enemies, like ishida and Rengi's team up against the number 8 espada. But then it turned int okinda just a bunch of ""power battles"" like DBZ where whoever is strongest wins. (btw Bleach is my fav anime so dont think i hate it its just its kinda grating where it is) One Piece, however, has ingenuity all the way through and doesnt rely on just power battles. When Luffy's enemy can read his mind and predict his movements he decides to punch the wall behind him and let his attacks ricochet all over so the enemy cant read it, or Ussop tricking his enemy into unconsciousness when she coudve overpowered him easy. But dont think its just a bunch of weaklings who hav to outsmart everyone, they are strong too! Like the Groggy Ball where sanji and Zoro team up to totally overpower the competition or Luffy's first use of Gear Second. (Still love that) Oh and about that in particular, it doesnt get waterted down the moe he used it. Like in Bleach, Bankai is just another power everyone has and has kinda got watered down, but when Luffy initiated Gear Second you just know its gonna be epic and powerful. The humor was also very welcomed as it seemed to help move the plot along since it was so long. Overall I was very impressed with the series as a whole and cant wait for the new episodes every week. One Piece was the most pleasant surprise thats ever happened to me. Great characters, solid story, uplifting overall atmosphere, epic battles, good humor, it has it all! Im very, very sad that i hav caught up and will now hav to wait every week but i can truely say it has been a fantastic adventure that i will never forget.

"One Piece. The Treasure Of Shounen Anime? One Piece is a PG 13 tale of adventure and comedy. It has been around since 1999 and the author said it is only half way done. It's no surprise this anime is in the top big 3! The One Piece story is a simple story about a kid named Monkey D Luffy with a dream to become the Pirate King and to obtain the ultimate treasure, the One Piece. The first couple of arcs is basically getting his powerful, witty crew together. Usually when an anime is introducing main characters there is little action, but not in the case of this one. Whether he had one partner or five The Straw Hat Crew (Luffy's Crew) always managed to stay in trouble. This anime is not just about it's action or wise crack moments, but it also get intense and will have you in tears (personal experience) as more of the story and mystery unravels. The art of this show throws some people off because it is not like the usually anime style, but looks cartoonish. I love the art and actually a lot of shows before the 2000's especially in the 70's and 80's looked like One Piece. I think it's art gives it unique style an easily distinguished it from the rest. The sound is where I have mixed views. If you watched this is dub I am so sorry and I know how you are skeptical of watching this show, but that was 4Kids dub. They chopped up the anime and made the voices younger like so it would appeal to kids. That is why I recommend skipping dub all together in this anime. Even the FUNimation dubbed is not finished and not worth watching. Please watch this anime in sub to get a taste of what the anime is really supposed to be like. Besides the Voice Actors do a splendid job. As for theme music I missed the first opening. I felt it went really well with the pirate them. I like the other openings as songs, but it really doesn't fit the adventure mood. The characters are something else. They are cliched yet not cliche and it's really hard to explain. I do not want to spoil it so I will only tell you that the characters each have their own special personality and this show works a great deal of showing their backgrounds. Even minor characters are not neglected in the show and you grow to love them like you grow to love the main characters. Overall I loved this anime and I recommend it to a person who loves to laugh, cry, and be overwhelmed with other emotions through the long ride.",8,Recommended,"Jun 19, 2012",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ef4a0774c7,25,2400
"Why One Piece is the Best Action-Adventure Shonen of Recent Years If you’re looking for the ultimate action-adventure anime, One Piece is the undisputed king of the genre. With its rich world-building, deep storytelling, and unforgettable characters, Eiichiro Oda has created a masterpiece that has captivated fans for decades. The story follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with the dream of becoming the Pirate King. Alongside his loyal crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, he embarks on an epic journey across the Grand Line, facing powerful foes, uncovering ancient mysteries, and forming bonds that define the essence of true adventure. What makes One Piece stand out is its perfect blend of action, humor, and emotional depth. The battles are intense, the lore is incredibly detailed, and every arc builds upon the last, making the journey feel grander with each episode. The character development is unmatched, and the emotional moments hit hard, proving that One Piece is more than just a typical shonen. With its massive impact on the anime and manga industry, One Piece isn’t just a great series—it’s a legend.

"one piece in my opinion is a very good anime, alot of people might say its overrated, too long, too childish, too much stupid jokes and etc, and it totally is. but lets get serious for a moment just start watching, if you like it, watch more, if you dont, just stop, i dont understand how people can write comments here saying they hate this anime when they watched 600+ episodes, in my opinion i really like that the anime is long, after watching seven deadly sins, tokyo ghoul, code geass, hunter x hunter, full metal alchemist and alot more (btw i really recommend watching those animes) and after finishing it i was... truly sad, sad it ended, i really find it stupid but i actually cried when hunter x hunter ended, i hate losing a good anime, the faith that an anime i truly love, One Piece will as alot of people say ""never end"" truly makes me happy, with Naruto dying and releasing too many fillers, and dragon ball super just releasing the same thing they showed in the movies in extreme detail, i escaped to one piece, dont regret that decision at all, im at 704 right now and still addicted to it, so please, dont listen to people who say its too long, too stupid and etc, just decide for yourself.",9,Recommended,"Mar 14, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_db06f8ee0b,25,1209
"I know I could be overeacting but I think One Piece is the greatest shonen anime/manga ever. It's not overrated but underrated by people who thinks it is overrated. After watching, I started having less interest on average type of shonen anime except for Fairy Tail. Don't be misguided by ""A rubberman who wants find a treasure"" plot. The story has so many possibilities. Nevermind the art. I think it has the same art style as dragonball. People always says that Dragonball is like the greatest anime ever but I think One Piece is. It has the same quality of fight scenes, humor, art as dragonball but One Piece has a more deeper story line than dragonball. Since episode 1, the story of One Piece has only one goal that becomes broad and deep as the story progress unlike dragonball which is mostly about fighting every enemies that tries to invade planet earth. One Piece also has a great character development. Even supporting characters that you thought won't show up still shows up adding a great influence to the storyline.

Just go read it don't waste your time watching it, the show's pacing is really bad and slow. Which can be a huge turnoff for most people and to most people I'd recommend the manga, it just feels faster in my opinion.

"I started watching One Piece a little more than a year ago now, and I binged at least 560 episodes. probably more, but that's the actual number I feel comfortable sitting at. Honestly, I think for being the most popular Manga and Anime out there, selling the most in Japan and extremely popular overseas it's very overrated. I honestly was excited to start the show and see what it was all about, I even read the first 3 volumes of the manga but was never interested in actually continuing with that, so I can really only speak from the perspective I have after watching the Anime. There might be reasons (there probably are considering some of my problems with One Piece the Anime) that don't apply to the experience of the Manga which is fair in it's own right. But the problem with the Anime adaption is that I was put off from even wanting to approach the Manga at all. I will explain. I got quite a way through the show, as of writing this review there are 920 episodes, but I stopped watching somewhere in mid to late 2018, the point being that i've watch enough of the show to with this sample size (more than half of the episodes which have currently aired) to discuss the show and not be rebuked for not having given it enough of a chance. Make of that what you will, but I have had, frankly, the displeasure and boredom of putting up with the show until I just couldn't stand it anymore which is partially certainly the result of the show, as it totally fails to engage you whatsoever. I don't hold the opinion that it gets much better. From some of the other negative reviews it seems that if anything, it just gets worse. And that's where I begin, I got so far into the show, I was excited, but at some point a few hundred episodes in I realised that my excitement was wasted. I kept wondering ""when is the show going to actually start"", then I realised. . .This is the entire show. The feeling I got was that the show is a constant setup for the real plot, but that's not true. What feels like the never ending build up of lackluster character introductions that last for 20-30 episodes each (like what's his name, the skeleton guy) is actually JUST THE SHOW. Nothing comes from this constant set-up, hence why it's technically wrong. There is no ""real"" plot. I got bored of the easily forgettable island escapades that have god awful amounts of episodes where each character fights their own individual enemy for 20 episodes each, I'm thinking specifically of some train car battle just prior to the time skip on episode 517, hell it might've even been after the time skip. Also another instance which sticks out painfully is Luffy's constant fighting with ""Foxy"", a character I looked up just now because I remembered the only outstanding feature during this god awful ""arc"" (which I learned was an arc just now after having looked it up, god help me) was that Luffy turned into Muhammad Ali with an Afro and boxing gloves. They meet a couple of times, Luffy gets his ass handed to him, it's terribly drawn out and boring, repetitive and couldn't even be droll. I just wanted to skip it, but hoped that perhaps it'd either end quicker or get better, but it simply never did. I don't remember much about this arc or any other, besides the fact the villain was annoying and I couldn't stand his constant reappearance. These are the other problems. The show to me was ultimately forgettable; hence the reason I don't bother to look up the names of some of the straw hat pirates, like the Skeleton dude, I just honestly do not remember his name and I want that to illustrate that point. All the arcs merged together, I cannot tell you which they were or what was accomplished other than some sappy emotional nonsense, like when Robot guy has a relationship with old ugly mermaid woman....And...Something to do with Dolphins? I don't remember. But I do remember that Usop was angry at Luffy for some reason and they fought but it was resolved and everything was fine. To be fair, I do remember that eliciting some emotion from me but like the rest it was ultimately plain. To kind of sum up, I found the show repetitive, drawn out, perhaps not uninspired as the set pieces and overall design is really great, but the story certainly isn't anything special. At least to me. The Characters are very one dimensional. That's probably what makes the show less than average. All of them struck me as extremely boring, with only one defining character trait and many other character deficiencies. Luffy likes food and wants to be king of the pirates, he's utterly oblivious to any of the other characters and what little emotions they manage to squeeze out of their thin outlines. He seemingly only has 3 emotions: happily annoying, angry and sad. He has the same amount of ""character traits"", such as: being dumb, being hungry, being a contrived leader nobody seems to respect. Probably more, but I don't remember. Although it was kinda neat to see how Luffy reacted when his brother predictably dies, however it was a let down when he just gets so sad he freezes up. I didn't feel much at that moment despite all the tension. As for the others Nami is a money hungry whore, maybe not a whore but definitely a tease. Nico Robin is a mummy gf in her 30s, skeleton man (who i thought was named ""Frank"" but is actually ""Brook"" and the mech man is actually ""Franky"", yeah, I looked it up this time) is dead and he's obnoxiously ranting about that fact whenever he can, which is supposed to be funny but comes off as annoying because it wasn't used sparingly and it ended up becoming his character instead of being a character tick which defined his character in some meaningful way. It never came off like an insecurity for example, even though I think it was supposed to be? Anyway. There's Sanji who's presumably a wannabe manwhore, but is just a perverted virgin (not that there's anything wrong with that), at least he can cook but he's an utter simp so he has no luck whatsoever. Zoro. He's cool. But that's just it. He's cool and apathetic which are just adjectives for ""boring"". The others I don't care about, they're not important, Tony² Chopper is the inserted ""cute"" character, he's a deer, but everyone thinks he's a dog. They play this joke so hard I actually started to forget while writing this that he actually WASN'T a dog. I don't even think they ever actually say what he clearly is in the entire show, at least not the 560 episodes I subjected myself to. I remember a certain part that at the same time i've forgotten, where finally, Sanji did something perverted, and subsequently he said he loved Nico, or Nami, I don't remember the full situation, what happened or what was said, but that's the foggy memory I have. But while watching it, there was a brief second where I finally thought the characters would actually interact and there would be some kind of bonding, perhaps Sanji would be rejected but the girls would try and understand him a little bit or whatever. Just dig a bit deeper, I'm not a writer, I don't know what they should've done I'm just saying I expected more. But they did none of this, Sanji just reverted back to his paperthin one dimensional pervert character trait, and Nico or something hit him and called him a perv. It was at that moment it struck me about One Piece what it was I couldn't connect with, and it was the characters because they never really connect with each other and FEEL like a crew. They do display emotions, sure, but usually (from what I remember) in their introductions when they interact with characters from their past, or in memories. Like Nico and her mother, or Nami and her Sister?? The crew never interacts in a way with each other that makes them feel like they're all a crew that wants to be there and has a stake in the plot. Even if that plot is just travelling a set course to multiple locations while wacky shenanigans occur, creating a kind of scooby doo effect where the characters split off and unite at the end where they leave. wash rinse repeat. There's just no character development whatsoever, none of them, especially Luffy for a main protagonist utterly fails to actually grow as a character. Learn lessons, reflect, have moments honest and true with the enemies he faces alone or with the other Straw Hats (an exception might be his defense of Nami early on). They all as characters stay stagnant and stale, they might grow for an episode but simply revert back to the way they were before in order to hamfist the same ""development"" whenever utilised in another episode down the road as to seemingly avoid continuous character growth. This is almost to be expected when the story is so lightly sketched in that it barely has an outline. What comes first? The story or the characters? Does the characters shape the story or does the story shape the characters? This reminds me of Socrates and his dismantling of Euthyphro's explanation of Piety. The point is that no characters can develop in a setting like this despite the fact you'd actually think there would be plenty of development considering it's a story about Pirates with a vast world of characters and explorable possibilities within the genre especially when including the numerous liberties Oda takes while telling a ""story"" inside this ""genre"" to begin with. What I mean is that ""pirates"" seemingly have very little to do with the show and is more window dressing for the audience than anything but it barely even sticks to such things considering how ridiculous One Piece can get. Merging many genres and in so doing inserting out of place elements like robots. In any case there's a lot of creativity but Oda never utilises it for producing characters and story which contain substance. It's all flare, and it's boring. I wanted something more, but what I got was overrated. I never got the feeling that they overcame their selfish reasons for joining the crew, and indeed this is true, hence why they all split up and there's a timeskip. But even after the awfully long time it takes for the plot to basically fill up time by REINTRODUCING these same characters 4 years later or whatever, it still feels soulless. The ""story"" is much less like a comprehensive adventure which takes you on a wild ride, than it is a show with arcs that essentially act as the same every time you view them but with simple changes in scenery. 1) Straw Hats reach the next Island 2) Meet locals. 3) Discover that there's a problem 4) Help solve the problem 4) Receive praise and take on another crewmate 5) Leave. 6) Repeat. Because the path to the ""One Piece"" is already mapped out with islands there's little attention payed onto how they get somewhere, finding it, and the trials and tribulations it would take to to achieve all that. Every other pirate who's looking for the One Piece is on the same course and this is where the conflict arises, not out the actual Journey itself and how hard that would be, but the simple vapid criminals the Straw Hats come across along the way. There's no strategy or mystery (besides what the One Piece actually is) to define the show and help it evolve and shape the characters into something unique and interesting. It's not like Deathnote for example, which has a perfect plot where mystery is a factor EVEN WHEN you as the viewer see everything the characters on both sides see. One Piece cannot even manage a one sided mystery. Because let's be honest, how many people who watch One Piece do it because they're enthralled at finding out what the ""One Piece"" actually is? Not many I'd dare say. So what about the show is alluring to people? The answer? I don't know. Read their reviews, some of the ones i've seen are kind of vapid and praise generalities about the characters which really don't exist. Invoking Odas sob stories he inserts to create the facade of Characters who're deeper than they otherwise act. I don't really have anything more to say, other than One Piece is the ONLY anime i've watched that's actually left me with nothing that stands out, or to take away. And what does, even a little bit, is the bad taste that was left in my mouth; which doesn't strike me as a good sign. Maybe the Manga is better, but frankly I cannot be arsed to bother when it might take me lord knows how long for it to ""get good"" over 95 volumes. I didn't write this review so anyone might not watch it, although that's a possibility of course. It's worth watching to see IF YOU like it. If you do, hey that's cool. But I didn't, I really fail to see the appeal and what anyone actually gets from it. I don't see the story going anywhere, there isn't much of one as far as I can tell, besides the goals the characters have, as to how any of those will be interesting I don't know.

"One Piece, a series that is often viewed as being to long and convoluted by certain individuals in the community, and seen by others as the golden standard for an anime, with arguably the most fanatic fans of any anime. One Piece to me, like many others, was my gate way series and I while I believe it is very good, there are many flaws that can definitely not be overlooked. The main pros of this series its world building, being able to introduce new exciting islands from the winter island called Drum Island to the desert kingdom of Alabasta, the world building of the different pirate crews and countries is fascinating, and while albeit a little repetitive, still somehow keeps your attention for majority of the time. The characters themselves are also phenomenal, with some of multiple of my favourite backstories coming from this series alone, and while people may not see the conventional ""big Eren like personality shift"" Oda is able to subtly change their actions while still sticking to the core of their characters. To go along with a well thought out and ever evolving story, this show has remained a thrilling ride for around 25 years, however, the anime in particular has certain issues that bring down its rating. The weakness of the One Piece anime is of course its pacing and its animation (up till Wano at least). Of course Toei had a lot to deal with as it came up every week, but the filler in between episodes and the subpar to downright bad animation made it hard to get through, particularly the Dressrosa arc. The art in the manga is pretty good but the animation was bad for decades before Wano came and made it one of the best animated shonen. Another problem is that One Piece is so long that certain parts of the series that foreshadows certain events or that give certain characters development is often forgotten, this means that a lot of details aren't remembered which allows for people to criticise, criticism that may not exist if they remembered the whole story. Of course this is a weakness as Oda did not do a good enough job at making an impression, concepts such as bounty hunters are also forgotten or extremely undeveloped. Overall, this will always have a spot in my heart and will be one of my favourite anime, however, there are multiple weaknesses that prevent it from being the top tier.",8,Recommended,"Feb 17, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1b61a46d23,25,2337
"I started watching One Piece around January of 2021, as a joke. The idea was, I knew most of my friend group would end up watching it someday, and that I could just spring it on them that I've seen the whole show upon being caught up with it, and threaten them with spoilers. Obviously that sounds like a stupid joke, but it basically meant that for watching One Piece, this big 1,000 episode show, not only would I get what enjoyment it must contain to keep it alive so long, but I could bully my friends with it, which means I had more motive to watch it and sit through it, yet I still couldn't make it to episode 200, even while skipping filler, it was just too slow and boring. Story: 2/10 The story was actually really interesting and captivating until shortly after they enter the Grand Line. I loved it and within the first 100 episodes I had the show as an 8. But even I noticed during the Alabasta arc that the show was becoming too slow-paced for me. I made it through the Alabasta arc, skipped the filler, and set my sights on the Skypiea arc. It was really good, until they all got trapped in the Upper Yard. Once that happened it became BORING AS HELL. I was all hyped to see God Eneru and learn about his powers, and how he usurped Gan Fall, and the lore behind the Shandians, but there were a good 4 or 5 fights that had villains like Yama, Luffy just being lost and not getting any screen time, Chopper being dumb and asking a deadly villain to ""please not damage the ship"" and ""please don't hurt me"", and it was just too boring. ""OH MY GOD PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!"" I cried but to no answer. So I dropped it. Art: 3/10 The art was pretty interesting, I didn't like it or dislike it, but the animation quality from the beginning to where I quit the show makes it a 5. It can still be impressive. The character design for main characters is great, but for side characters it isn't so fantastic. We have characters like Igaram, Yama, Satori, Hotori/Kotori, etc, which are just annoying to look it, it's like Eiichiro Oda thought ""Hmm you know what? You know those people that watch my show? Fuck them, they can kill themselves,"" while proceeding to draw large circles, give them faces, and call it a night. I'm going to count that against this rating instead of the characters one though, so the art is a 3 for me. Sound: 7/10 The sound was pretty good. It wasn't trash, they had a couple tracks that definitely added to the scenes, some that made everything on screen annoying. The openings and endings though were fucking FABULOUS. I always force myself to watch openings and endings all the way through, sometimes against my own will, but I never once wanted to skip a One Piece opening or ending. It's what I'll miss most about the show. Character: 7/10 The characters were good. The backstories of the main characters were intricate and well-composed, not the ""my parents died and I've been all alone"" backstories you see in a lot of popular Shonen anime. Enjoyment: 3/10 Like I said with the story, it is super good, like an 8 or a 9 until after the Alabasta arc. But unlike the story which immediately shoots down around 1/3 through Skypiea, the enjoyment slowly declines starting about halfway through Alabasta. Overall: 5/10 That is what all of my scores average out to. If you are considering watching this show, watch it on Netflix, because Netflix has all the way up through the Alabasta arc, episode 130. It only stays good for a little bit after that.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 12, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_7a91433154,25,3476

"The closest piece of fiction to the on point definition of a 'masterpiece'. It has its faults, it has its issues, but the positives for this show outshine the negatives once you watch/read this series. most people say 'it's to long' or 'the pacing sucks' or 'the anime art style is bad/bad animation' and my main response to all three is - read the manga. But since this is the anime version here are my reasons for why personally, I didn't mind these 'issues' + When watching it felt 'to short'. It's way of bringing me in and keeping me engaged - while i will admit there were points where it got boring, the feeling that after this boring patch something exciting would come through kept me going, the Long ring Long island arc, Ocean dream and Foxys return arcs, I remember was the arcs where I almost dropped it entirely, but I kept pushing, hoping it would reach the peaks it was hitting like in the alabasta saga. And, well, BOOM. Water 7 and Enies Lobby followed, two of the best arcs in the series and some of my personal favourites of any arc from anime entirely. + The pacing - well I can admit this is the main issue I kind of noticed while watching and can admit this was an actual issue I can't say I had a personal difference with, but I can point back to the to short argument, the fact that the arcs may be long and feel long but most of the arcs almost have you ignoring that factor as they bring you in with ease. + The anme art style/animation argument - well this is just a subjective argument, and I can't really say much to combat this as it is a personal thing, but the main thing that kept me going with the bad animation/art styles was the fact that the storylines,villains,characters, places, the vibrant feeling of each individual interaction kept me in it, the overall homeliness and comfort you gain as you watch and start to grow connections to the characters is priceless - to the point the animation or art style doesn't matter. The best anime/manga ever created, handsdown.",10,Recommended,"May 5, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8eb538fd9c,26,2007

"Needless to say, it is one of the most iconic and longest running shows of all time, spanning up to 1000+ episodes as of writing this and it is not a bad time investment in my opinion for entertainment if you are into the classic, shounen type of anime. I wouldn't say that it's LIFE-CHANGING but its definitely a good/fun watch and is quite action-packed for what it is. Animation (7/10) - Over the years it saw a steady adaptation to the standards of the industry; It can be really easy to tell what year were the episodes were released just from eyeballing its quality. So in totality it doesn't have a steady line of trademark, its more of an evolutionary thing for the eras' it goes along with as its runtime continues. I wouldn't say they have something masterpiece-like going on, but its not terrible considering they release weekly too. Storyline (8/10) - I think they are doing a good job, gradually showing Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates' progression as they go along; It is very rich in unique and personable characters (even for the filler episode ones!) whether may they be friends or villains. They are quite easy to digest too. But the problem I have is, the pacing of their storytelling is way too slow. That's why it has over a thousand episodes, and I feel like it could be faster, not gonna lie. Music (8/10) - They have a lot of memorable and catchy soundtracks over the years; Whether it may be songs or the ones used for battles; It typically fit its introspection of adventure, action and pursuit of legacy in general. Heavily forefronts trumpets for its orchestration backed by violins, strings and woodwinds. Very trademarked on how they produced their pieces which gives them distinct identity. Although minor concern, they lack a little bit of versatility since their compositions have already been established.

"Right into it! Pros: - Awesome world building. - Great character development. - Interesting lore setlings. - An overflowing quantity of quality characters. - Covering almost every genre from the expected action, adventure, comedy, drama, fantasy & romance, to the unexpected (though  so you do this research apart). - Fights are meaningful and/or humorous. - Bonds between events and characters have basically no borders. - Its unique art style makes up for a variety of draw designs, some unsetling, some quirky, others funny and yet never they feel unfitting though this could vary on your ability to get used to it. - No 3D abuse (except sometimes in openings, though rather experimental than the former). - Not afraid to cover some controversial topics and estereotypes, nor it forces them onto you. Cons. - It has filler episodes mixed with canon content, so you'll have to swallow those if you want the full picture. - The production as of now has been slowed down due to previous point, so for a series as long as this, waiting could be a turn down. - For a creation as big as this one, you may find some plot holes along the way, though they're not lore breaking. Final overview This is a very complete adventure experience in anime, and depending on how much free time you got in your hands it could be a treat or a pass, it could fill those feelings you were looking to satisfy or could overwhelm you as the pacing is not how you would've better liked it. Nonetheless is a great work that's just held up by Toei's treatment in later seasons, and its lenght for certain kind of audience. Even with all that, I feel it's a must try for entertainment and doesn't really deserves less than a 10 just because the animation was on the manga heels.",10,Recommended,"May 27, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_57ab2d2faa,26,1751
"One Piece is a modern Odyssey. The overall story is amazing, servicing every level of interest—from a casual experience to those seeking deep, emotionally complex writing. Don't get me wrong—you’re getting a fun pirate adventure about the main character’s journey to becoming King of the Pirates. But every single accomplishment feels well-earned and addicting. At first, I was sure I would drop the series once I felt the sheer weight of the episode count, but now, I feel like there isn’t enough! I'm caught up to the manga and may or may not be reading the leaks as soon as they drop. This is a series I would recommend to anyone, regardless of where they are in their anime journey. What I’m about to say, however, might sound contradictory. You know it, I know it—this show has a pacing issue. I’ve personally watched it three times up to its current episode, so I can speak from experience. On my first watch-through, I followed a filler guide (https://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/one-piece). On my second watch, I introduced the series to a friend and used a mix of the famous fan project One Pace, which edits the anime to be as close to the manga as possible. Is it perfect? No. But by the end of the journey, we had almost exclusively been using One Pace. Now, on my third watch-through, I'm watching with another friend and using One Pace from the start. This has been the most streamlined experience, and I highly recommend it. I suggest using One Pace all the way up to ""Roof Piece"" in Wano, then proceeding as you please. Personally, I’ve found Egghead’s pacing in the main series to be fine. All that said—if any other series had these pacing issues, it would be absolutely unbearable. But One Piece is just different. It’s worth the patience. It completely changed my perspective on watching anime. There was definitely a phase in my anime-watching journey where I would pick up series just to say I watched them, like adding notches on a belt. Now, I want to go back and rewatch as many series as possible just to enjoy them. Have I been glazing this show? Absolutely. I get it—the sheer popularity might turn people away, and the episode count will almost certainly intimidate some. But it’s worth it. TL;DR: Give the series a shot. Ignore the 1,100+ episodes—just start from episode 1 and watch up to 45. If you’re not hooked by then, One Piece probably isn’t for you, and that’s completely fine.",10,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_39ef072a54,26,2417
"""To true friendship, how long you've known each other means nothing."" - Bon Clay. This phrase was said during an episode of one piece, and never have I seen a show stick true to its messages as this one. One piece is a manga based adventure tv-show, which has been running since 1999, and has established itself as the third highest selling comic book series, and one of the most popular anime to date. It is written by Eiichiro Oda and has been directed by multiple people. This show is set in a world far different from ours, where the strongest man alive, the pirate king Gol D. Roger, passed away but challenged the world to find his hidden treasure, the one piece. The story follows the journey of one of the people seeking this treasure, a teenager named Luffy, and his crew consisting of Zoro, Nami, Ussop, Sanji, Chopper, Robin, Franky, Brook and Jinbei. We follow Luffy and his crew as they venture out to the unknown sea called the grand line. But this show isn’t about the hidden treasure, but instead the journey that lead to its discovery. That is what makes this show simply outstanding. Furthermore, this show has some of the best world building seen on TV, if not the best. Since the show is held in a separate world than ours, and with over 900 episodes, the viewer begins to truly understand the aspects of their universe. They understand its dangerous and threats as well as the mysteries yet to be discovered. For instance, from the begging of the show we are introduced to an era in the history of their world where nobody knows what occurred. It was if the events were completely erased from existence. But slowly as the show progresses more of this hidden mystery is revealed. In addition, despite this series being animated, the shots used for each scene make the show’s events feel believable. The directors stays true to the knowledge of modern film techniques and implements them into the series. This series is also beautifully animated and has a large variety of music. They animators are somehow able to create each island and terrain with its own unique touch, allowing for some beautiful animation and scenery. This is followed by some amazing background music fitting of each theme. For these reason I fell in love with the TV-show one piece. Its general amazing plot, fleshed out characters and beautiful shots have made me appreciate it as one of the best TV-shows still running. Despite this show’s great length it is definitely worth every single minute of your time, especially with the show coming to an end in the following few seasons.",10,Recommended,"May 28, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9753e2d383,26,2576
"! One piece is a great anime that has been running since 1999. Now someone new trying to get into one piece might get confused by the varying reviews ranging from really good to bad. The thing is they are all correct. One piece is indeed incredible but at times it can be incredibly slow and some arcs are just plain boring, for me it was the god Enel arc, which is an unpopular opinion. At first the filler arcs were actually good and enjoyable but now I just tend to skip them. The start of the show can seem a little boring as each character's background is established. Now if you can endure the start it actually pays off as even some of the minor details are referred to further in the story which makes it worth it.

"“Power isn't determined by your size, but the size of your heart and dreams!” ...[Monkey D. Luffy] In my opinion , One Piece is an incredibly popular anime, known for its unique blend of action, adventure, and comedy. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man with the power to stretch like rubber, as he sets out to become the king of the pirates and find the legendary treasure known as One Piece. One Piece has a vibrant and colorful animation style, which is beautifully rendered and full of energy. The characters are all distinct and memorable, with unique designs and personalities. The action scenes are fast-paced and intense, with a great sense of impact and weight. The comedy is also well-done, with many funny moments and gags that are sure to make you laugh. The story of One Piece is vast and epic, with a huge cast of characters and a complex and intertwining plot. The world of One Piece is full of intrigue and mystery, with many different factions and groups vying for power and influence. The characters are all well-developed and likable, with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the relationships between them are complex and engaging. One Piece also has an excellent soundtrack, with a wide variety of music that fits the mood and tone of the series perfectly. The voice acting is top-notch, with each character having a unique and distinct voice that helps to bring them to life. The overall mood of One Piece is energetic and exciting, with a sense of adventure and excitement that is sure to keep you engaged and entertained. In my opinion, the best arc of One Piece is the Dressrosa arc, which is full of twists and turns, and introduces many interesting new characters and concepts. The arc focuses on the battle for Dressrosa, a kingdom ruled by a corrupt and tyrannical king, and the Straw Hat pirates' efforts to help the people of Dressrosa overthrow their oppressor. The arc features some of the best action and drama of the series, and is a must-see for any One Piece fan.",10,Recommended,"Dec 12, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_38dbc6e912,26,2033
"A 10? NO WAY. but, its the best a long-running shounen has to offer. Let me start: I am a huge One Piece fan, and I have admittedly not watched much non-mainstream animes. Story-9 Art-7 Sound-9 Character-5 Enjoyment-6 Overall-8 Overall: 8 Imagine a great story you could never get tired of. This was Dragon Ball Z before it started blowing universes. One Piece, on the other hand is still able to maintain the depth characters possess, and advance the story even as the world grows bigger in the eyes of the audience. The characters lack development. The anime focuses on the characters' originality rather than development. The world is very big and a lot of people have a lot of different issues. What if there was an anime with a great story that you wish you could savor forever? Well, its One Piece. It doesn't end and is still going strong- what more could you ask for? The story: 9/10. I like when things have a history- so lore never bores me. One Piece offers great adventure and action based story. The world-building is simply phenomenal- power systems, pirates, parts of the world, types of power- using people, marines revolutionaries, control of the government, prison system, secret services.... everything is present and does not seem forced. Popular shounen animes suffer from a forced world-building failing to establish a sensible system, One Piece does not. The world is detailed, sensible and dos not feel forced. The art:7 Its good and I don't see why people hate it so bad. Could be possible I just got used to it, but I have zero problems with it. It wasn't exactly great at the beginning episodes, but considering the sheer volume of the episodes and its age (1999), its not worth complaining. The sound: 9 Voice actors could not have been better. Music is on point. Bink's Sake is a masterpiece. Soundtracks are unforgettable, simply wonderful. Openings are well, openings. They were great at first, then got average and occasionally some great openings do come up. The Characters: 5 Except for Zoro, everyone else is pretty much one-sided. Negligible character development. I would have given even a lower score, but that would be unfair. Nobody in the crew is there for no reason. Everybody has a dream somehow requiring them a voyage across the world. Their past gives them a great depth. Majority side-female characters look like Nami, but with a different hair style/color. Luffy is an average baka character that sometimes gets angry. Sanji is a cliche pervert. Zoro has got a dedicated-for-revenge personality, but isn't. Nami is typical damsel-in-distress, that sometimes is badass. Other animes cannot focus on more than maybe four charachters, One Piece has done so. Villians get beat up more because of the antagonists' willpower rather than tactics. The fights capture emotion, and are plot- driven. While characters have depth, they lack development. Enjoyment: 6 ITS SO GODDAMN SLOW. Pacing is downright horrible. For the love of god, stop talking in middle of fights(talking about post-timeskip ones). Used to be better, but now as the Toei Animation streches a single panel of the manga into a 5- minute long animation, pacing becomes tragic. It was fine pre-timeskip, but now people stay clashing midair for a fucking minute without zero ability yo do so. There are comments on every punch hit, every major move made. Three- panel clashes in the manga is translated into half of the 24 min episode. Other than the fights, everything else is watchable. Used to be entertaining, but now its so slow, its painful.

"Really long review with some spoilers. I will devide my review in Story, Art, Sound, Character and Enjoyment *Story* The story started really interesting. A boy who wants to search for the great treasure One Piece and searching for Nakamas for his pirate group. One Piece is devided in arcs. So each arc has a own story that leads to another arc. The problem was not the goal.... It was how long the anime/manga is being going on. Since 20 years+ . I see a lot of parts of the story repeated in every arc. Sometimes it gets boring when for example someone gets in a jail or the same jokes were made. But the story has good aspects too. I love the deveplopment of the hidden mysteries in One Piece. Thats what takes me deep inside. Or the sad parts in flashbacks... Sometimes my tears wont stop. Thats why I love that show for. *Art* The art is really inconsistent. Thats because the anime is going on for 20 years. Digital animation become a thing and changed the art from the 90s and 00s. There were minor changes throughout the series so far: First after Skypia arc, then while Sabaody second part happened and after WCI arc in Wano Arc. The art that changed during Sabaody II was the worst. The art felt really shiny and the characters looked a lot of times off model. Sometimes we got slower action moments due to the pacing issues. ANd sometimes we see no animated scenes. In WCI arc though it got better with better time schedeules. The other change was in Wano arc inspired from the Broly movie. They changed the whole upper staff from One Piece with 3 series directors. The art has no shining colors and looks more modern. Also we get better animated fights, better angles and some more. The art looks more consistent too. The only problem is how directors of the episode handle One Piece episodes. Some are really bad that leads to stiff characters... *Sound* One Piece has one of the best soundtracks in the whole anime industry. The only thing I dont like are the sound effects from Dragon Ball that are used in fights. Sometimes same soundtracks are spammed in every episode... *character* That aspect is really a problem. I liked how Oda (The creator of One Piece) focussed a lot to the characters before the timeskip. After the timeskip he focussed more on side characters in the arcs to develop their characters. I will focus on the main characters Luffy: Luffy is the main protagonist in the whole series. He has the ambition of being the King of the Pirates. Till the one life changing thing around the timeskip he got no character deveplopment. After that one thing that occured the character of Luffy never changed. After that moment he wanted to become stronger. He has a humourous character and tries to be funny. The thing that I hate of him is that he is still childish in his mind and not listening to important things. But I love his strong determination Zoro: The badass in One Piece. No one gets better fight scenes than him. The fangirls would love his abs. He is my favourite character in whole One Piece. His ambition to be the best swordsman in the whole world is really interesting to follow through. But after Timeskip he barely got any good sword fights. Mostly he cuts the opponement with really easy sword slashes. Chopper Really nice backstory and nice touching moments when he cares for his nakama. But also he is the most disappointed character in whole One Piece. He could have been a lot stronger after timeskip... Nami The most annoying character of One Piece but also the most sexy woman who is favoured by Sanji. But the jokes become really really boring when she hits someone if someone ask for panties or being pervert. In the anime she is being sexualized and I dont like it every time. Sanji I love this man but also I have mixed feelings. I really feel sorry for Sanji that he cant get ladies. He is a nice man but gets hit or unlucky. Oda should give that man something. Robin I dont like her character. She had one of the best moments in One Piece in Enies Lobby and after that her character has been ruined. She feels more like a robot or Amazon Alexa when you ask her something. Thats really sad and a waste of oppurtunities. Brook He is a pervert skelton but after the arc where he got introduced Oda focussed less to him. In WCI he got more attention and I want to thank Oda for it. His pervert Jokes are not funny anymore though. Every time asking women for panties gets really annoying. *Enjoyment* Thats what every One piece fan says: The pacing is really bad. I agree its bad. Sometimes I ask myself why it is how it is. But I try to bypass that fact and try to enjoy. Sometimes I really enjoy the episodes and sometimes not. The thing is that 5 Minutes are being gone due to the Opening and retelling. Sometimes you get good paced episodes where no much stalling happens and sometimes really much. Its like a classical western cowboy film where you wait who takes the gun first but stalling with 4-8 Minutes. The cliffhangers sometimes make you less looked forward to the next episode. I dont know if I should drop the series for 3 months to binge watch it, but I cant do it cause Im interested how the story goes on... Overall a 7/10 from me for the recommendation",7,Recommended,"Oct 6, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a2a099d7f4,26,5225
"Easily the best anime I have ever watched and I have watched 14 different action-shounen anime. At the beginning it seems bland and pretty meh but as the episodes go on the story expands and so does the world of one piece as well as the animation and you realize how much of a genius the writer is. Be patient with this anime, It's like an rpg, Bad at the start but once you progress it gets more and more enjoyable to the point you become obsessed. Also make sure you watch the SUB and not the DUB because the voice acting for the DUB is horrible and they also water down the story depending where you watch it. There is a main character but all the other characters in this anime also have a role of importance and strength even many of the antagonists aren't just one-arc characters. The writer will plant a seed early on in the start and reveal the tree 300 episodes later and there is many examples of this. Everything is meticulously planned and everything ends up falling together, I am up to date now at episode 924 and there is still so much of the plot shrouded in mystery and so many questions left to be answered which the writer also plants in your head. Absolute genius of a story! For an anime to be rated 8.5 on MAL when it started airing in 1999 speaks volume that the story is so extravagant that it is akin to fine wine that gets better with age. There is one or two arcs you might find a bit boring but hustle through because there's always a bigger picture at play in this anime.",10,Recommended,"May 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_070917a64c,26,1500
"No single review could ever amount to the magnitude of mixed feelings i've felt watching this anime over the last 12 years, but it's a risk worth making should i only succeed in making this single point crystal clear. Story: 10/10 I often ask myself ""What makes a good story?"", but quite interchangeably I now ask ""What makes One Piece's so good?"" - what separates it from everything else, and why would anyone in 2017 commit to the behemoth of episodes? Well ... for the most part I don't think many people 'can' watch it. It's my belief that had you joined the roller coaster 18 years ago, it would be much easier to love because this anime certainly hasn't aged well for those without the highest form of patience and it's excruciatingly slow-paced. Yet, returning to my former question what separates it's story is the 'Flow' - and it my belief this is what has made it a masterpiece (Filler & Specials excluded). Sadly, we're seeing less and less emphasis on this basic storytelling technique, as sophisticated plot and characters take the center stage. I've yet to see a new successful action anime without apocalyptic stakes and drama we've all seen many times. The brilliance of One Piece is that the stakes and drama unfolds onto the characters themselves and their friends but never onto the World. As a result the plot is naturally driven by the characters as they frequently react to their needs, wants, loves and desires. New land's call to them, but they have a choice and some of this anime's drama in the beginning revolves around Captain Luffy's leadership but as the anime progresses a group-friendship born from love, tragedy, desperation and forgiveness rises, and with their loyalties - so, too does their Standing (Power) to the World. Characters: 9/10 The Captain and First Mate of all Pirate Crews are hierarchical of strength, however to Luffy's Strawhat Pirates the title is mainly a formality, however for the sake of time, i will argue the strongest of the group are reflective of the rest and it's also worth noting that exclusive 'best friends' don't really exist among the Strawhats as their friendship is mutual across the crew. The unique bonds between characters may at times be confused as a character's preference to one another but when boiled down, they treat everyone the same. Monkey D. Luffy To the onlooker, I could understand how Luffy appears as cheesy 'Comical Relief' character and to an extent this is true. In the face of danger that would otherwise strike fear or anger into his peers, he will be remembered by me as the most light-hearted anime character of all time, but also the most wrathful. I see many similarities between Luffy and Goku (DBZ) only Luffy's living in harsh world, forcing a more human/realistic character. For instance in his mistakes and weakness, he'll weep and apologize. There's no coming back from the afterlife, and death leaves it's scars on him . His passion and dream for discovering the One Piece treasure far exceed anyone else in the World, however he wouldn't hesitate to throw it all away if it meant saving a friend. The very little ego he bears is seen in the rare times he must stop being a friend and act like a Captain for the sake of others and his dream. Roronoa Zoro Best defined as the untameable beast with swords, who is indifferent from all his comical friends in his seriousness. I'd once wondered ""Why three swords?"" but this oddity is quickly pardoned by the mastery of his techniques. Ironically he's pretty normal in the world of One Piece and Devil Fruit powers. Again, to ignite perspectives i'd draw as many similarities to differences between Vegeta (DBZ). Pride, separates him from sharing moments with the Crew, and the case is strong for Zoro being more powerful than Luffy, and for what begins as a ""I help you, you help me"" deal between Zoro and Luffy quite slowly turns into a friendship defined by Zoro's actions and never his stubborn words. Character progression is strongest with Zoro Sound: 3/5 (Excluding Openings and Endings) Music throughout does perfectly drive excitement, however these instances come far too rarely and could probably be counted on one hand. It's my belief that those who believe Sound and Art really define good anime are the very cause and death to Creativity in anime, and i can quite easily look past One Piece's under-performing music - though one would do well to note that my standard for 5/5 is one track's 'timelessness' and transgression from anime to communities worldwide (try Shirō Sagisu's - Never Meant to Belong) Art: 3/5 (Subject to the scrutiny of 2017) - Old art = 2/5 + New art 4/5 Truly original artistry, however i believe the Story deserves the credit after all it's the catalyst for the artistic flexibility that's hardly ever allowed by typical plots. Overall: 25/30 ~ 83/100 ~ B Performance To conclude, the anime isn't perfect. Many deter from it, or Drop the series by virtue of it's art and slow pacing which are fair considerations to have especially when subscribing to an anime debated to be only 50% to 80% completed at 700+ episodes. My advice would be against the average viewer attempting it. Many of today's action series run fast towards the cataclysmic conclusion. Only once you get bored of the same recycled plots and character template should you consider the voyage of One Piece. Everybody searches for an anime that will leave them wanting more, but with One Piece you don't have to wait, but you still need patience :D Sincerely, Willowboy. “Join my wander, to a yonder.

"One Piece Review: One Piece is an anime I would highly recommend watching and trying it out. It is about someone named Monkey D. Luffy and his journey in becoming the King of the Pirates. It is a very mysterious show and there are so many different possibilities and theories. It also goes over and illustrates real world problems such as government corruption, racism, slavery, genocide, epidemic diseases, human trafficking, and many more. It's a show that's been going on for quite a while. The first episode aired in 1999 and the story goes on with many mysteries such as the void century, world nobles, the reverie, devil fruits and so many more.",10,Recommended,"Nov 8, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_516e1cc793,26,651

"It's pretty peak, after 1k+ episodes it's really bingable but also really good for watching some here and there. The characters are nice and you feel along with them a lot. Some might be intimidated by the episode count, but it's a chill anime, it's something you can watch when you're a bit braindead and don't want to pay that much attention, so the episodes go by quickly. But when it has its moments oh my god it has its moments. I won't spoil anything, just give it a go. The way I remember everything about the earlier arcs, and how it's tied into the story, means to me that it must be a great show. As a final word, learn how to use the 'skip 5 seconds' key well then you will have a splendid time with this anime :) every time they show one face they're probably gonna show 5 other faces which you can gladly skip. The show makes sure to set the tone when dialogue becomes important, so you will most likely not be missing out. After episode 500 I spend an average of 10-12 minutes per episode, depending on if it's essential to the plot it might be more. But I haven't missed anything yet, you can skip a lot in this anime that is just made to pad out the time.",9,Recommended,"Jun 18, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9d31ec70f1,26,1171
"""One piece is one of the greatest pieces of fiction of all time""-a former one piece hater, charlie ""moistcritical"". why did he say that even though he thought at first luffy was just an annoying main character? why did he say that when at first he thought it was long and boring for no reason? its because of its depth and worldbuilding. i am still seeing theories from things that happened in the first episodes, and no other anime had me interested in locations as one piece. oda makes you think everything has meaning because everything does have a meaning, every place is tied to the mystery of the void century and every detail might say more about the people who lived at that time (OP fans you know who) and its all together in a battle shonen that's ""for kids""... its battles, mystery and adventure, sometimes even really deep. not to mention the characters are the best from design to personality like buggy (i love buggy you will love buggy too you dont have a choice to join the buggy agenda) anyways it very goog and me likey it",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e82b7fc8ff,26,1040
"I have been converted into a One Piece fan... there I said it. But that would make for a poor and short review so, let me start off by saying, I hated one piece for many years. I cannot stress enough how much I disliked it. This wasn't for the usual reasons either like the unusual Art style or the english dub (I haven't heard that since it first aired on toonami when I was a kid). I blame it mainly on the anime just being flat out boring for the first 200 episodes. even the Alabasta arc, which was the first major arc of the series was sub-par at best. I was committed to watching this show though in order to find out what all the fuss was about so I must have re-watched up to the sky island arc over 9 or 10 times but still I couldn't figure it out. Eventually I decided to just power through sky island and i didn't regret it. I discovered that the greatness that is one piece begins at the ""Water 7"" arc. it is the first time That you can see the characters really come into their own and not just win through luck or crying really hard. It is at this point that the fights hit that ""Let me find an AMV of that"" kind of level. This is also the point when the artwork goes HD and stops looking like a first grader drawing pirates over a water color. So aesthetically the anime becomes much more enjoyable as well. This is especially true when the crew reaches saobody, the artwork becomes absolutely spectacular and you begin to look forward to what amazing scenes you will see next. the Characters are all relatable and the stories can be really difficult to pull your head away from. I will admit though, sometimes the constant crying from the main cast can be a bit too much and their general stupidity can also be a bit trying at times, but beyond that, if you can push through the first 200 episodes, you wont regret it. i would give it a 10/10 but the first bit makes it really hard.",9,Recommended,"Oct 19, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_07d1e403d5,26,1898

At the start, the boy was panicking about not succeeding. However, Luffy knocked on his head and said the possibility doesn't matter, but he wanted to be pirate king cos he wanted to.

"The story of Monkey D. Luffy's quest to find the One Piece and become the King of the Pirates offers a blend of uniqueness and familiarity. The concept of a treasure hunt is a classic trope, yet the story sets itself apart with its richly detailed world, imaginative settings, and the sheer scope of the adventure. While some plot developments might be predictable due to the genre's conventions, the journey itself is filled with enough surprises, quirky characters, and creative scenarios to keep it engaging. Personally, as a fan of epic adventures and grand quests, I found the predictability to be part of the charm, enhancing the comfort and excitement of the narrative. The characters in this series are well-rounded and diverse, each with their own strengths, flaws, and distinct personalities. Luffy, for example, is incredibly strong and determined, yet his carefree and sometimes naive nature often leads him into trouble. His companions, too, exhibit a range of abilities and characteristics that make them feel real and relatable. They have their own motivations, backstories, and personal growth throughout the series, adding depth to their roles. This balance of attributes ensures that the characters are compelling and believable, making their interactions and development a key highlight of the story. I believe many people will enjoy this series, even if it isn't to everyone's taste. The blend of adventure, humor, and emotional depth, coupled with a unique art style, makes it appealing to a wide audience. Fans of epic quests, character-driven narratives, and imaginative worlds will find much to love here. However, those who prefer more grounded or serious storytelling might find the series' whimsical and fantastical elements less appealing. Overall, the series' strengths lie in its engaging characters, vibrant world, and the sense of adventure that permeates every episode, making it a standout in its genre.",10,Recommended,"May 30, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a795975cd5,27,1937

"This show was a masterpiece up until the underwater island . I definitely encourage you to see it for up to episode 750 i guess (so around 250 hours) of quality anime with incredibly awesome character development and back story. Afterwards the show reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaallly slow down . each episode now contain the minimum ""content"" you can put into an episode. However if you can read the manga unlike me , you will have all the fun. The anime Arc system is one of the best , because each island is like an arc (more of a level) . each island got the same idea of progress , which sound boring but is extremely fun . Every here and there he is collecting a crew member some are better than other (as for you the viewer) . Art style back then is kinda shitty because it was made in 1999 now its ... more shitty but in HD . As i said , you will be faced with an awesome anime that will sadly loose its brightness . Mostly if you wanna know why I recommend this it will be because of emotions this anime give you . in each backstory you will cry , in most arcs you will cry . both of sadness and joy",9,Recommended,"Sep 28, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f6b62a67c8,27,1103
"One Piece stands as a monumental testament to the power of storytelling in the realm of anime, captivating audiences worldwide with its boundless imagination, intricate plotlines, and an ensemble of memorable characters. As a devoted fan, it's genuinely exhilarating to delve into the multifaceted world Eiichiro Oda has crafted, and I find myself compelled to share the reasons why this anime has not only endured the test of time but continues to reign supreme in the hearts of its admirers. First and foremost, One Piece's narrative brilliance lies in its intricate world-building. The Grand Line, the Red Line, and the myriad of islands, each with its unique culture and challenges, form a kaleidoscope of diversity that fuels the anime's adventurous spirit. Oda's ability to seamlessly weave together complex political intrigue, profound philosophical undertones, and lighthearted humor is nothing short of genius. Whether it's navigating through the mysteries of the Void Century or confronting the emotional upheavals of the characters, One Piece is an intricate tapestry that unfolds with each passing episode, leaving fans eagerly anticipating the next revelation. The heart of One Piece undoubtedly beats within its characters, a diverse and captivating crew that has etched itself into the annals of anime history. Monkey D. Luffy, with his unyielding determination and infectious enthusiasm, leads the Straw Hat Pirates on a journey that transcends mere piracy. Each crew member, from the enigmatic Roronoa Zoro to the empathetic Tony Tony Chopper, contributes to the synergy that makes the crew a familial unit. Oda masterfully crafts their backstories, creating emotionally resonant arcs that delve into their dreams, fears, and aspirations. Witnessing their growth and the bonds they forge is a testament to the anime's ability to explore the human condition, making it relatable and inspiring to fans of all ages. Beyond the crew, One Piece introduces a myriad of compelling and often morally ambiguous characters, from the Shichibukai to the Yonko, each adding layers of complexity to the overarching narrative. The enigmatic and flamboyant antagonist, Gol D. Roger's former crewmate, and now the Pirate King's successor, Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard), exemplify the series' ability to create formidable and intriguing adversaries. The ongoing clash between the Navy, revolutionaries, and pirates keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, as alliances shift and the balance of power in the world undergoes seismic changes. The animation and art style of One Piece have evolved over the years, culminating in a visually stunning spectacle that does justice to Oda's rich and dynamic universe. From the picturesque landscapes to the heart-stopping battles, the animation studio has succeeded in bringing the manga to life with flair and fidelity. The meticulously designed characters, inventive Devil Fruit abilities, and the grandeur of the battles are a testament to the dedication and talent of the animators, ensuring that each episode is a visual feast. One Piece, however, isn't merely about the grandiosity of its battles or the intricacies of its plot. At its core, it is an exploration of friendship, resilience, and the pursuit of one's dreams. Themes of camaraderie, sacrifice, and the relentless pursuit of freedom permeate the narrative, resonating deeply with viewers on a personal level. The emotional highs and lows, coupled with the humor that seamlessly punctuates the intense moments, create an emotionally engaging experience that transcends the typical shonen formula. In conclusion, One Piece is not just an anime; it's an odyssey that has left an indelible mark on the landscape of animation. With its expansive world, deeply layered characters, and a narrative that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and philosophy, One Piece stands tall as a beacon of excellence in the anime genre. As a fan, I eagerly anticipate each new episode, knowing that Oda's masterpiece is destined to etch itself further into the hearts of both longtime followers and new converts alike. Embark on this grand voyage, and you'll find that the allure of One Piece is as boundless as the sea itself.",10,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fd7a3e2a9e,27,4215

Each episode from the Fishman Arc onwards only really has about 10 minutes of new content and a lot of that is looping animations to pad run time. Once it got to the Big Mom Arc I started to notice the extreme drop in animation quality as well. Because of this slow pacing and excessive drop in quality it is hard for me to even watch a single episode now.

""""" From the outside, I always thought One Piece just didn't look that great. 900 episodes later and I couldn't have been more wrong XD.. Honestly never saw myself rating this show a 10 o.o The episode count alone used to be one of the things that kept me from watching in the past. Sadly now that I've made it through almost all of them I only wish I had another 900 left to watch. Compared to other long-running animes One Piece has managed to find the sweet spot on how to continue a story without making it feel drug out or boring. They did an amazing job at keeping old characters that you met at the start of the show feel relevant much later into the series. And having so many episodes helped to drive a more natural character progression over the years. I kind of look at this way. Take Naruto and Fairy Tail, trim off all the bad parts and take the remaining good stuff that you may have loved from those shows and that's One Piece. Good exciting fights, high adventure, enjoyable characters, engaging story, sprinkled with justs enough sad bits to balance things out. Oh and very few fillers compared to the number of episodes.

I don't know what's the fuss about One Piece getting rid of all the filler, the animation is still repetitive, pace is slow and at worst cuts off from storybeat to storybeat. But by the gods, the hype. It hits in a special way when you've watched or read the series on/off since Alabasta. I never hated OP, just the path it took during Fishman Island and especially Punkhazard. It has remained close to my heart nonetheless. I've laughed and cried with it for years. I've grown with it, lumped my understanding on it many times to see layers upon layers of fine tuned entertainment. I adore One Piece for what it is.

This is all from my personal experience, and it probably won't be same to you. All I'm trying to say is please join this crew of millions. This decades old journey. One day it will end. To see the sails burst wide one last time... I want all of you to be there with me. Let us set sail together, to the endless dream. (original below) Don't hate it, but dropped it around Fishman Island due to decrease in production quality. Continued after that in manga only. This is my choice of the old ""big four"" and the only one that is still ongoing (apart from the restarted DB). I highly suggest One Piece even as an anime even though it has horrible amounts and many kinds of filler stuck with it. Some moments of the story are delivered with just that much punch that it's worth it. The animation quality decreases drastically after the time skip, so be wary. The time skip also kinda splits the story in two halves. Join me, millions of others and Luffy as he gathers his crew, captures everyone's hearts and seeks out to be the one true king of the seas. Your efforts will be paid off.",10,Recommended,"Jan 10, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_cd5b592449,27,2335
"Now , I understand everyone that says one piece is too slow it's way too predictable etc , even though all the fight shounens have the same story and we still like them I mean at least I do. I believe if you like animes like bleach , naruto , black clover , demon slayer and others you may also like one piece, about the art style in my opinion I have seen worse and the characters are beautiful in their own way for example Jinbe , Zoro , Sanji , Nami, Nico robin, crocodile, donflamingo , trafalgar law and a lot more .

"One piece is masterclass. The art grows on you, the characters are irreplaceable, and the soundtrack and intros fit One Piece's story so well that it's hard to find another like it. My personal favourite anime(s) stem from each genre and follow no real path. I like anime like AOT, Eureka Seven, Blood+, and Code Geass. That said, one piece's genre was something I was never really into. I've always been into more of a psychological/drama/action type person, so it is interesting to say that one piece is one of my favourite anime's of all time. I'd only recommend this anime to people who ONLY care about enjoyment of an anime. Don't watch one piece if all you care about is a certain genre (ie action, fighting(martial arts), etc) or even an overly complex plot. It's an adventure anime at heart that brings you along the journey as a way of narrating the plot. So, for those who like wholesome funny anime with good fighting scenes and an amazingly well thought out adventure plot, this is the anime for you. If you're looking for a good amount of gore, any bit of romance, or even strict fighting everywhere in the anime then this isn't for you. Who knows though, just like me you might still somehow enjoying it more than any other anime you have seen.

"I started watching One Piece on a whim to find out why it appeals people so much, I gathered the intention to watch One Piece because of the very large number of episode. At first I thought it would be impossible to finish this series in the long term. Then I tried to watch spoilers to make me more interested in watching One Piece. After I watched it it pulled me into its world where fans theorize each other about the One Piece ending, not wrong theorize because in the anime there are still many plot hole. I'm confused as to why people are not interested in watching One Piece, I think they missed the opportunity to watch the best anime ever.

"When I first embarked on the journey of One Piece I honestly did not know what to expect. After catching up with Naruto and found myself perusing different anime trying to find something similar to Naruto. After watching a few rather short series, I was intrigued by One Piece but quickly became dissuaded as the episode count was around 400+ at this point. Well I decided to wait till I had free time to watch it. Fast forward a couple of months. It's the summer break, I'm bored at home one day and decide to give One Piece a go. I'll admit that while the first couple of episodes were enjoyable, I could tell that I was not truly hooked on the series. The art style was rather strange, a lot of characters had disproportionately large feet compared to their bodies. The animation in the beginning is also not that great as this is an old series(however both the art style and animation improve over time). The episode that threw all doubt about this series was the Baratie Arc. In the early East Blue saga, Baratie is my favorite arc for a numerous amount of reasons. The themes touched upon during that arc spoke of the power of will, ambition, and dreams. This is was the moment I knew I was in it for the long haul. One Piece is still continuing with the end still quite a distance away. This anime while containing basic shounen elements, such as a not too bright protagonist with a goal and having friendship be a key aspect, is able to contain a lovable quirky main cast, most of which are not one dimensional characters, a vast and unique world which is brimming with adventure, and a milieu of interesting characters and plots contained within it. My favorite aspect of One Piece is the adventure and exploration, the mangaka Eiichiro Oda was definitely successful in creating an interesting and vibrant world, and the anime for the most part conveys it well. The animation quality is the biggest complaint I have with this anime. For a majority of the series the animation quality is actually pretty good,it started off poor but steadily improved. After the Skypiea arc the improvement is significant. The quality lasts like this until the Marineford Arc, after which it devolves. Currently, due to almost catching up with the manga in terms of content, coupled with the poor animation quality by Toei has made the One Piece anime drop in quality, which is a shame because One Piece has a sacred spot in my top 5 manga.",7,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_400ca86e52,28,2431
"Before I begin my review, I would like to tell you that I will be completely honest about what I like about One Piece and what I don't. I'm not a fanboy, and I've been a HUGE fan of Naruto/Naruto Shippuden for over 8 years prior to starting One Piece. Few other long running anime I've watched and loved, Hunter X Hunter, Gintama, Detective Conan, Dragon Ball Z. (I've watched/read all of Fairy Tail, loved it then started hating it, just like many others). I say this so that when I say One Piece is my absolute favorite among shonen anime, you will understand how much I actually love One Piece. I started One Piece a little over a year ago and it has quickly become my favorite. I have never regretted starting One Piece..except for the fact that I'm kind of obsessed with it now. Lol. P.S: Ignore any typos. And grab some snacks because it's a very long review. My review will be quite long (too many good things about One Piece) but I will include a shorter/summary version at the bottom if you don't have time. But I suggest you go through it all :) Let me start with the negatives, which is only one and is only concerned with the Anime. Negatives: The Anime has terrible/painful pacing, especially during the Skypiea, Thriller Bark, Punk Hazard, Dressrosa arcs. This however, is exlusive to the Anime version and can be overcome by skipping through episodes, skipping fillers (if you wish), etc. So it's not too much of a concern. You'll just have the trouble of waiting for at least a week just to get an episode that cover one or less than one chapter (which is quite less). Now coming to the pros. There are a LOT of amazing things about One Piece. Plot (10/10): The plot of One Piece is the single largest plot of any popular anime that has come out thus far. I say this with confidence as other long running series like Detective Conan, Hajime no Ippo (which are very good themselves) have a narrower plot. One Piece has phenomenal world building. Without spoiling too much, it occurs in it's own UNIVERSE and time. In terms of the vastness of the setting, only Dragon Ball Z comes close. There's several hundreds of different/unique powers. Most of these powers (including that of the protagonist) are completely fresh/never before seen anywhere, not just in anime. (And no, it's not just Devil Fruits) The plot intensifies exponentially and increases in complexity as it progresses. The first 100 episodes, it's just the pirate Monkey D. Luffy, the protagonist, and a his first few crew mates sailing to find the One Piece, a legendary treasure that has been left at the last island of a harsh, destructive Ocean called the Grand Line. But soon we realize a lot more. In the next 100 episodes we learn more about the ACTUAL plot. By the 200s, we have a very well established plot line, but it still grows. In the following 100-200 episodes we learn much more..and so on. By the first 400 or so episodes, the setup is done and everything that follows is just pure awsomeness. With every passing arc, the story gets better and better. However, there is on not-so-important arc which is mostly for comedy which I personally loved (like almost every other One Piece fan, so you probably will too) People often complain about how long One Piece is, but let me tell you this, that's how big and vast the plot is. It REQUIRES time. You will have to be patient. Everything that happens in One Piece happens for a good reason, but it does take time. So be patient and try to watch as many episodes as possible. You can binge watch it and finish it in 3-months (Like I did) (as of 28th March, 2016) or watch it slowly over the course of a year. The plot is always, ALWAYS filled with mysteries. Some answered soon, some so EPIC that we can only learn of them when the series reaches it's end. This is one of the things that keeps me going. It always has comedy. Many many epic moments and even more to come (it'll be obvious once you catch up to either the Anime or the Manga). Honestly, I've been a One Piece fan for very little over a year now but I don't see myself disliking it ever. I have more than enough confidence in Eiichiro Oda's story writing that was built through 734 episodes and 820 chapter (and still counting). I was never disappointed with any aspect of the plot of One Piece (Except maybe one, but that's completely insignificant). One Piece has many great/amazing/epic fights. However, let me warn you, there's many mediocre/decent to good fights as well. I would recommend Dragon Ball Z, Hunter x Hunter, or Naruto for fights. The fights in One Piece are are not as good as in these but are still very good and enjoyable so no worries here. Even if everything else (art, sound, fights) were terrible, (which obviously is not the case. It's the exact opposite) the plot alone is worth a 10/10 overall. Trust me. There's a 90%+ chance that you will feel the same. If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into this. Also, contradictory to what some might say, One Piece is not repetitive. There is always a reason for why something happens and its almost always different. So be prepared for an exciting, adventurous, enjoyable, funny, action packed, suspenseful story...I mean epic. That's right, One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. ------------------ Characters (10/10): One Piece is filled with several amazing characters whom you will love and several others whom you will hate (amazing evil-minded, hateful villains). Shanks, an amazing character introduced early on, has in fact inspired the creation of a very popular character in another series! Gildarts from Fairy Tail. There's a vast variety of personalities you will find in One Piece. and many important characters have great character development. Both the antagonists and the protagonists have great moments and undergo proper development. --------------------- Animation (7/10): The animation of One Piece is not good. However, epic moments, epic fight scenes, etc. are almost always very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie level animation! If you don't believe it, watch it! (Full of spoilers though, obviously) The animation is great when required. Other times, it's quite still and stocky. But this shouldn't be much of a concern either as the important parts are seldom badly animated. The series goes HD somewhere near the early 200s because it started in 1997 so don't judge it too soon :P You can look up Naotoshi Shida scenes in One Piece. He is a very famous animator and has created several beautifully animated scenes for One Piece. ----------------------- Art (9/10): You must've heard, One Piece has a very unique art style. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD The backgrounds are always amazing and full of detail. There are thousands gorgeous shots/panels. --------------------- Sound (9/10): The One Piece soundtrack is also one of my favorites. The background scores fit the situations perfectly. Suspense building, action, adventurous, uplifting, you name it. There's tracks for all this. It's heavily orchestral. I often find myself listening to the soundtracks as they are quite epic. ---------------------- So yeah, that's it. Overall, One Piece is superb, excellent, amazing, awesome, etc. Few downs here and there but those are very insignificant in comparison. --------------------- SHORT VERSION The plot of One Piece is absolutely amazing. It grows in complexity as it progresses and is always filled with intriguing mysteries. The main plot line is more than just finding treasure and becoming the Pirate King. It's unbelievably huge. One Piece has a vast setting and amazing world building with epic, unique powers that were never heard of before. There's always comedy, adventure, action, mystery, and fun in One Piece. Due to it's vastness and complexity, One Piece is very very long. However, ignoring the bad pacing of the Anime (only) it is never boring. If you feel like an episode is being dragged, forward it, or skip through a few stretched parts (Like 30 seconds of smoke, 5 minute stare-downs, 6 minutes of recap, etc.) The slow pacing can be easily overcome. Everything in One Piece happens for a reason, and it is seldom repetitive (contradictory to what a few others say). Has many great fights that are often very well animated. The infamous Marineford arc has almost movie-level animation. But fights aren't it's strong point (though they are epic). If you've heard someone say ""One Piece sucks, no one dies"" do not believe them. They probably watched only a few episodes. Another great thing about One Piece is that only characters that matter the most die. And as I told you, the plot intensifies exponentially, this means character deaths are ever increasing (but not by much). But this is as far as I'm willing to go into deaths. Amazing variety in characters. There are characters whom you will absolutely love, and others, like villains, whom you will hate (in the good way. Evil villain = more hate). And there's villains who are badass as well. Many intriguing personalities and backstories. Great character development Art style is unique and character designs are almost always amazing. It has heavily exaggerated character designs (which I've come to love). I mean the badass characters look badass as hell, gorgeous characters look absolutely gorgeous, ugly characters look ugly as hell, etc. If you're new to it, you're in for a surprise. It's unrealistic yet epic. Plus whoever said unrealistic = not good? One Piece is evidence against that xD Has very good soundtracks that capture the moment perfectly. One Piece can be considered an epic. That speaks for it's complexity. ----------------------------------- One Piece has quickly grown to be my favorite shonen anime. I hope you enjoy One Piece and one day we could probably spend hours and hours just talking about it. Patience is key when watching One Piece. But you will most probably get hooked to it pretty soon. But make sure you have time. For those on mobile Story 10/10 Art 9/10 Animation 7/10 (Damn you Toei Animation) Sound 9/10 Characters 10/10 Enjoyment 10/10 Overall 10/10 (Plot is absolutely amazing.

"One Piece is as close as you can get to a perfect series. It puts Oda's hardwork from these past 20 years of putting his body through hell to produce the best of content for his fan's enjoyment. Character work, Backstories, Drama, Adventure, Mysteries, Over The Top Goals, World Building, you ask and Oda does it better than anyone. But Oda's work doesn't gets as much recognition from the newer generation to which 800+ episodes is a daunting task, which is true to say the least. Although getting into One Piece is hard to said the least i mean the number of episodes crushed my urge to watch the anime a couple of times until finally i decided to watch it. One Piece is all about pirates travelling through the vast seas looking for the great treasure named ""One Piece."" The one who will find the treasure will earn himself the title ""Pirate King"" something which every pirate on the seas wants to become. The former Pirate King, Gold Roger ushered the world into a great pirate era. ""You want my treasure? You can have it! Search for it! I left everything i gathered together at that place!"" - Gold D Roger's dying words that drove countless people to become pirates in search of his treasure, One Piece. The Main Character named Monkey D Luffy idealizes Gold Roger and dreams of becoming the Pirate King by finding the One Piece. He is so obsessed with his dream, that his catchphrase is actually ""I am Luffy and i will be the king of pirates"" and he doesn't lets a single opportunity slide to let everyone knows about it. He later recruit his loyal crew as they travel through the harsh seas of the ""Grand Line"" while solving mysteries and defeating strong enemies in search of the One Piece and fulfill their individual dreams. If you want to start watching the anime i recommend you to watch the movie special : ""The Episode Of East Blue"" -The Special Covers The First 44 Episodes of the anime The First 44 Episodes focus on the Main Character Luffy looking for members for his pirate crew. These episodes feature character arcs for the members he will recruit across 5 arcs. The arcs focus on their Character, Backstory and their motives so the audience can connect better with the characters. With this you could easily be hooked into watching the anime as was i If you find yourself interested in One Piece after watching the special and want to continue then continue on watching the next episode which is episode 45 and forward. However i have to say there are a lot of filler arc in one piece therefore the wiki is your best friend. All filler arcs are non cannon and just a waste of time in my opinion since it bring no plot driven trivia and just gives small jokes and in all honesty just by filler we can eliminate a few tens of episodes. And with that you should watch One Piece. Because if you don't you're missing out on a one of a kind show that make you experience all kinds of emotions.",10,Recommended,"Oct 8, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ed77219495,28,2909

"One Piece it's one of the longest running titles of all time, when I started to watch it, I was really impressed by the huge ammount of episodes and chapters, but I have to say that most of the experience was really quick. This review will be divided by the first four sagas of the show (East Blue, Arabasta, Skypiea and Water Seven), because if I do the arc by arc thing, it will be just long as the bible. This isn't totally my personal opinion of the series, it's the most objective review that I could do for one of my favourite (not best) shows. EAST BLUE (Episode 1 to 61): The story starts with a kid in a little island, he wants to find a really important and searched treasure, when he grows up a bit he starts the journey, in this saga he will form his crew, and go to the next area, the Grand Line. This saga it's one of my favourites, it has a lot of effort on it, you have a lot of fun moments with the characters and most of them have a significative backdrop and a bombastic personality, also each character of the crew has a labor to do on the journey (study the weather, cook for the crew...) but also all of them have a singular way to fight the enemies. One thing that many people points out as bad in this saga are the visuals, for me the Toei anime adaptation here captures totally the magic and the exageration of the manga, with one of the most unique styles I have ever seen. As I have said, I won't go on many details, I find most of the arcs of this first part from good to great, the best one beign Arlong Park for having each character doing something, a menacing villain and one of the best backstorys on any character that I have seen ever. Maybe it's a bit messy that this saga doesn't have a main villain (maybe Smoker but he cames only at the finale), but I like most of them (Buggy, Gin, Arlong, Kuro...). So this part it's very basic and simple, but has totally EVERYTHING for a great action adventure, it has comedy, drama, creative battles and great world building. Final mark: (8/10) ARABASTA (Episode 62-135): In the previous saga, there wasn't a real plot in general, only plots for individual arcs, but the principal one was just doing a crew for finding a treasure, in this saga this is no longer the thing, the story here starts with an island full of people celebrating the arrive of our heroes, but they are in reality a big corporation controlled by someone called ""Crocodile"", the protagonists have to help a princess of an entire kingdom to stop this corporation that wants to kill the king of Arabasta. So we have now a main objective, a more interesting plot and a main villain. This was for me a really great decision for part of Oda, and I have to say that he didn't only had a great idea, he executed also pretty well. The heroes go on some islands before Arabasta, they fight some kings and people that work in the corporation of Crocodile. This is probably the weakest part of the saga (specially the Chopper arc), beacause even if this arcs weren't bad at all, they were a bit slower that the ones of East Blue saga, but at least they had really brilliant moments, like thhe giants realtionship, Chopper's flashback or some of the main battles. When they arrive to Arabasta they meet Ace, Luffy's brother, they meet with Smoker and Tashigi again, Crocodile it's shown with a ridiculous powerful habilitie and the setting of this desertic island it's just great. The slow pacing works here because there are a lot of things going on at the same time and we need a bit more time than before for understand what is going on. This arc have my favourite battle of them all (Luffy VS Crocodile), and the rest of the side battles are also pretty good and interesting (except Nami's one which was boring sorry). Speaking of the villain, he's just great, Crocodile has a lot of personality, their motives of removing all the water of the desert are justified, it has a lot of pressence and it's always trolling the heroes mentally. The finale it's one of the most satisfying ones that I've seen, it's just really epic and also has the tragedy of Vivi lefting the crew, it was pretty real and not out of place. My main problem it's the plot armor, seriously there's a lot of it in the last 20 episodes, a guy just survived a nuclear explosion, wow that was bullshit. Overall, was a great saga with many problems but with a ton of good stuff too, I personally liked more than the previous one. Final mark: (8/10) SKYPIEA (Episode 136-206) Robin joined and she has no personality or backstory in the whole saga, it's really akward for like 100 episodes and by far the worst companian by now. I can't say many things about this one, I liked the first 15 episodes or so when they go to that island full of unrespectful people and then shows Bellamy as the villain of the arc, I find him funny and also had an interesting philosophy about dreams and goals, also Luffy's punch was epic. My problem with this saga it's, that it kinda has a plot but at the same time doesn't, the heroes are changing their objective constantly and it's even frustrating. So yeah I liked the Jaya arc, my problems are with the main arc, when they go to this sky island where it's God and also a bell that they need to find to prove that a guy that they just met (and was not there anymore) wasn't a liar or something. It's a bit messy and also the pacing here is even slower that the one in Arabasta, and here there isn't that much going on, the people just goes around in a giant jungle and tries to survive, that's it. The villain it's called God Enel and I really liked him because, even it didn't had the intelligence of Crocodile, he has charisma and a power of mass destruction, but his showdown with Luff was disapointing and really dumb actually. I don't know, this saga was really promising with a cool setting and themes like religion and believes, but nothing was executed properly. Final mark: (6/10) WATER SEVEN (Episode 207-325) And this is the part of the review that the fanbase will hate so if you are just a fanboy that thinks that this is the best part, please get out of here. I'm not longer hiding it, this is for me by far the worst saga until now, it's the last that I watched of the anime (now I passed to the manga for better pacing and art). Let's start with... a dumb tournament of 20 episodes long? WTF, we pass from a god of electricity to a silly tournament and then to evil corporations again like in Arabasta. I will skip the foxy arc, it's just not worth-watchable and overall a waste of time, if you want to laugh okey, but I think that this arc was situated terribly. At least at the final of this one, we get to know Robin's dreams a bit more, and there's a really overpoewered guy that... doesn't appear again in this entire saga until the ending just to go again. Then the Water Seven arc starts and I have to say that was pretty interesting and tense for a while, it works as a mystery drama action adventure for like 30 episodes and I really hoped something great out of this. Usopp was lefting the crew, the ship was broken, the enemies looked undefeatable (weaker than Enel I have to agree) and most of the arc is really serious and intriguing, Franky is also introduced and it's way better than Robin, he has charisma and he's really useful to the crew. So everything seems great for now, yeah? Well, then Enies Lobby starts and... it's the worst arc yet, maybe worst than the foxy arc because that was only awful filler, but this was awful real plot. First the pacing is again slower than the previous saga, but they also putted filler in middle of important battles and events for no reason, the animation changed to a more static one most of the time and not even the battles were fun at all. I only remember Nami and Franky ones, the rest had awful powerups and predictable resolutions (maybe Luffy VS Lucci was all right but that's it). Speaking of Lucci, he's... eh? I mean okey he looked cool for a while but he has no personality and only wants to kill people, also he's not even the boss, he's the subordinate of an awful guy with no strenght basically, that's lame! The whole plot also seemed like a rehash of Arlong Park and Arabasta, change Nami for Robin, Baroque Works for CP9 and you have it. In this part of the story it's also revealed that Luffy has a special family and basically from here to now the marines and the revolutionaries will help him not for who he is, by who their progenitors are, what is this Naruto??? I have a lot of problems with the saga, even if I don't consider it bad at all it piss me off that this is the most rated one, like c'mon!! Usopp turns to be a cool hero for a while but naaah he just comes back and status quo duh, he's not my favourite character anymore, I prefer Sanji or Franky now. Final mark (5/10) It's a shame that a show that hooked me in so much, now just became another generic shonen with no much to offer, I'm now reading Thriller Bark and it's fun, I also heared great things about the Marineford saga, so I will still viewing it, but I think that I will drop it in the timeskip thing. Still one of my favourites and the overall mark still possitive so I will hope better things after the mediocrity that Water Seven was.

"One Piece is by far the best shounen anime out there that I have watched. But not all share the same views as I do, lets remedy that, shall we? A long time ago, there live a fearsome pirate king who goes by the name of Gold D. Roger. He was able to attain everything. But alas he was captured and sentenced to execution. In the brink of death, he proclaimed that he left the great treasure, One Piece, somewhere in the Grand Line and it is for anyone to claim. This event ignited the Great Pirate Age. In the world of One Piece, there is such a thing as a Devil Fruit. A devil fruit is a fruit bearing some supernatural ability and whoever devours it will get a unique ability however its origins are unknown. There are three types of Devil Fruit, Paramecia, a fruit that can materialize your body into a property. Zoan, a fruit that gives humans the ability of a certain animal, but if its an animal, it gives the ability of humans. And the last but certainly not the least Logia, is a fruit that makes the consumer manifest a certain element. But of course nothing is perfect. If you eat any of the Devil Fruit, you will be rendered immobilize when submerge in the water. And where is our protagonist? The anime revolves around our mentally impaired boy, Monkey D. Luffy or a.k.a The Straw Hat Pirate(title came from his worn-out straw hat that he always have on). When our boy here ate a devil fruit that turns the consumer's body into rubber, he sets off to find Shanks, his pirate idol to return his straw hat as promise and find One Piece to be able to earn the title of Pirate King. Along the way he gathers all kinds of oddballs for his crew, The Straw Hat Pirates. Now how exactly is One Piece different from the hundreds of shounen out there. Well, it isnt. It is exactly what a shounen should be. It follows the lose-train-win formula. So how is it any better? Bingo. Because it incorporates the formula into something fresh and simple. One Piece arcs can be surprisingly good. There were even times that I was shocked at some plot twists and revelations. It has a very interesting setting as well. And what might that be? The World. The whole world is One Piece's oyster. It varies from vast, scorching deserts to cold snowy mountains, the concept of adventure here is well defined, it really makes you feel that world isnt small after all. And that my friend, is what an adventure anime should really be. One Piece knows how to pull it off, be it comedy or serious, and believe me, One Piece knows how to be serious when it needs to be. But it never forgets its roots at the same time, and that is the emphasis of friendship and the bond of Nakama/Friends that glues the whole crew together. Most shounen anime's suffers immensely from originality. Because of this, it is hard to distinguish characters from each other, especially in my case as I have my fair share as an otaku. And most of the characters in em lack depth and substance, its hard to remember a character when you know very little about him. But One Piece is immune from this disease. Each character of One Piece is very... say....unique that you'll find it hard to forget about them. They all have their individual motives, strengths, weakness and even quirky traits. Plus, each individual of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew has an immersing past, that'll be hard for you not to get delve into. And they all have a certain role, not one character gets overshadowed by the other. They do meaningful interactions with each other. And regardless, that each member is vastly different from each other, they all formed a formidable bond. Even the by-passing characters are memorable. In contrast to the majority, I find the animation to be creative. Just like how the characters are different and distinguishable. Unfortunately people see it as something of a turn off, and quickly judges One Piece as something infantile. I am not going to lie. One Piece will not go beyond the borders of a shounen. It is not mature. But thats not the point here. An anime doesnt need to be ripe to be good. It just needs to be entertaining. Although I do enjoy a deep, thought-provoking anime, an anime doesnt need to be complex to be satisfying. It can be anything, as long as it offers gratification. And One Piece does. Another potential problem is its popularity. Most people consider mainstream anime's to be somewhat of a failure because of its targeted demographic, and that is everyone. &quot;If its able to attract toddlers, then it sucks&quot; that seems to be case for most people. Some people neglect any anime that is able to summon countless little children in its area, thus abruptly convicting it as over-rated. Heck, some people even constantly hunts threads, just to be able to crack Narutard jokes off some newcomer. Do not judge One Piece from its fans. Judge it for what it is. Do not be mistaken, I am not saying One Piece is for everyone. In the end, its all about taste. But if your have any hint of love for shounen surging in your veins, there is no reason for you not to watch this, not one bit. In short, the plot is very promising, the main cast is several but well flesh out, the battles are very diverse, and engaging and the comedy doesnt get old, even after 300 episodes. But One Piece is not a masterpiece. It does not break any ground whatsoever. No matter how you see it, its still your typical shounen. Regardless of this, the level of enjoyment I receive from One Piece is insurmountable. And sometimes thats all you need. Scratch that. Most of the time that's all you need.*copied review*",10,Recommended,"May 9, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33b6ca576d,28,5582
"I rated One Piece a 5 even though I have rewatched this anime 13 times since it had 498 episodes, am I an idiot? maybe, but my personal enjoyment cannot cloud my eyes over what this anime did with the series. the only reason it gets a 5 is because it's a horrible adaptation of the manga which is immaculate. One Piece the anime is a fantastic way for manga readers to relive the experiences of reading One Piece for the first time again but not as the first experience. yes, I know many fans had their start with the anime but some of our NA friends had their start with the 4kids dub which everyone would rate a 0/10 even though it is One Piece. If you're reading this and want to experience One Piece in the way I always advocate it, watch episode 1 to 126, if you love it, read chapter 1 until current chapter as of writing this its at 1022 which I understand may sound overwhelming but one piece is an experience of a lifetime. it is my soul, my heart and my life. Get a friend who can send you clips of the anime that's super important and for the love of god, DO NOT SEARCH FOR ONE PIECE ON YOUTUBE, you have to avoid all spoilers. get off twitter for Fridays and I wish you luck on your journey.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 25, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_62bcef3a5b,28,1203
"In the episodes I have seen so far, I have only really encountered two things that keep it from being perfect. The first being the art - it is far from being the best art I have seen in anime. However, for me this is easy to look past as the story and music is amazing. The other qualm that I have is the slow pacing. Because of this, I have not been able to continually watch the series. I watch an arc or two, then I put One Piece on hold. I watch other shorter anime until all the One Piece discussion and videos popping up on my Youtube feed rekindles my excitement to watch One Piece. Whenever I come back, I do not regret it.Each arc is thoroughly enjoyable with its character development and unique plot. The filler arcs in One Piece are some of the best if not the best filler arcs in anime. One Piece has made me cry more than any other anime - that may be because of the sheer amount of episodes, but that's not the point. Even if it takes you a decade, One Piece is definitely something worth watching. It has a bit of a rough start, but stick through it. Give it a shot, at least watch the first hundred episodes.",10,Recommended,"Feb 12, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f249ce10d0,28,1125
"TO PEOPLE WHO CRIES OVER THE NUMBER OF EPISODES: GO READ THE MANGA. It's faster, addictive, beautiful background and still with funny jokes, and you waste less time with unnecessary frames of a character's face of suspense. Disadvantage: You'll loss the amazing and memorable seiyuu actors of each character, beautiful fighting scenes, and the amazing openings/endings they have. My introduction: I love One Piece since it aired on TV (Brazil) with few episodes. Besides the brazilian dubbing were extremely awful, it's story got stuck in my head: ""Did he already found One Piece? What it was?"". And then I found the sequel at Skypiea saga. OK LET'S GO Story (9): Every Island, and every character got deep story/past. the winning and funny moments gets repetitive to you give all your heart in it and then Eiichiro Oda can smash your heart and your soul with his hands. Some societies, government, objects also have deep story. The thing really irritates me is the filler. Everytime they want to put a new monster/friend/enemy with unique powers and want strawhat's crew to solve it in a few episodes. Dude, to the story gets OK they have to kick enemy's asses, clarify mysteries, and let some message to spectators. YOU CAN'T DO ALL THIS IN FEW EPISODES IT GETS MESSY, that's why Oda's work last a lot of chapters. If they need to do a filler, make something off-story, nothing too deeper, just an episode for fun. Art (9): This part is where I'm really annoying. Look, I don't care about it's traces since they've changing a lot each arc, improving and getting better. But seriously, why is it getting so colorful? The tons of colors are getting annoying in background, and side characters that don't need it. Seems like the TV series are trying to convince children's audience to keep watching by adding a lot of vibrant colors. The only need to put a vibrant color was to a character with a significant meaning to the plot, and now it's in everywhere. It's cute but makes a unnecessary mess. This is one of the (dumbest) reasons I recommend people to read manga. That's my -1 for Colors. But +5 for improving traces, +2 improving attack effects, +3 Gorgeous backgrounds. Sound (9): The soundtrack are gorgeous, I would really love it if they use more of the old ones. Some sound effects seems already used from another series (like dragonball) and I don't have any reference of a remarkable original sound effect from this series that make me jump OH I KNOW WHERE THIS CAME FROM, only for OST. Character (10): GURARARARA. oh damn, characters. That's masterpiece seriously. Each one have a memorable lore, or habit, or laugh, even the shape of the body. Well, I can't say that for most female characters tho. Their costumes, clothes are unique. And oh my Lord, the seiyuu they choose for each character are REALLY accurate. Enjoyment (9): If you're watching few episodes, this is your gold moment to laugh, find those videos of funny moments strawhats and give them a like, but the jokes overeactions from characters are getting too repetitive in anime, but manga is still good. Overall (10): I know I rate mostly 9 in each type, but I'm giving it a 10 since there're few works that could achieve 5 types and combine very well together with few failures.",10,Recommended,"Dec 19, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4fd2b0961a,28,3258
"One Piece is the legendary treasure said to be of unimaginable value. It was said to be hidden somewhere deep in the Grand Line, presumably on the last island, Raftel, by the late Pirate King Gol D. Roger. Before Roger was executed, he announced to the world that this great treasure could be claimed by anyone who could reach it, thereby starting the Great Age of Pirates. No one except the surviving members of the Roger Pirates actually knows where and what the great treasure is. The most popular theory is that they hid it on Raftel, the final island of the Grand Line. Given the recurring theme that a treasure is merely something of great personal value (e.g. Luffy's hat) and that Roger, like Luffy, did not value money or gold, One Piece may be nothing more than an item Gol D. Roger valued. In Buggy's flashback to his days as a member of the Roger Pirates, he discussed with Shanks the meaning of a treasure, and he found that all the crew shared the same views regarding personal value.[1] The closest the Straw Hat Pirates have ever come to finding out the nature of One Piece was during the Sabaody Archipelago Arc when Usopp tried to ask Silvers Rayleigh about it. However, Luffy stopped him on the grounds that learning about it from someone else would defeat the purpose of their adventures and that becoming the Pirate King would have little merit if he already knew anything about One Piece.[2] After decades of speculations and doubts, the treasure's existence was confirmed by Whitebeard with his last breath. He mentioned that ""a grand battle will engulf the entire world"" and ""the world will be shaken to its core"" when One Piece is found.[3]",10,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c31c0676dc,28,1665

"I know what everyone thinks when they see One Piece because I have friends who use to tell me these gripes about it. It's too long there's no way I can watch all these episodes or it's not interesting enough for me to pick because the mc looks weak. The art style is too old school for me wouldn't try. I get all these points but I promise you One Piece is a journey worth starting and you won't regret it. Art: 8/10 I know what you're thinking how can you give this an 8 when it looks like an old-school pokemon but I promise the art style is way better than what it starts off with. Obviously, the art style starts off very old school since it first aired in 1999 but during the skypiea arc, I noticed it went HD. The most noticeable change in art style was after the time skip making the fighting sequences more fluid and smoother on the eyes. Story: 9/10 The story has always been a big part of why one piece is so good granted it has fillers like any other long-running series but it's not as bad as Naruto fillers. Currently, only 10% of one piece is filler meaning there are 900 episodes worth watching of good storytelling and world-building delight. The show always made sure to connect all the pieces of one piece's story and made them connect so well it's insane. You'd see a character in an episode or an event happens and then 300 episodes later it comes full circle and connects making the story much richer. There are so many twists and turns as well as many different emotions to be had throughout the series and doesn't shy away from showing the world in a very gritty and dark aspect sometimes which makes it all the more thrilling. Sound: 8/10 The art and sound generally evolved and got better over time together so there is not much to say. I could tell you that they do use music in a very well thought out way making certain scenes more thrilling or suspenseful. It's definitely one of the reasons why so many emotions are had while watching the show. Also, the use of sound effects brings out the depth of a fight, and sometimes events taking place at the time. Character: 10/10 Yes, 10/10 the characters themselves are the biggest reason why One Piece is so damn good without them the show would definitely be harder to watch. The writing of the characters is exceptionally well and is most noticeable for the Straw Hat crew. They each have very deep character build-up and very interesting stories that also connect well with the world around them. They also have their own flaws and their personalities set them apart from other characters. If you think that's it well you're in for a surprise because not only is this done for the Straw Hat crew but also for every character in one piece aside from low-level pirates and marines cannon fodders. This makes most characters in One Piece unique and different from other characters which leaves you with a refreshed feeling when being introduced to a new character. Enjoyment: 8/10 One Piece is differently very enjoyable to watch especially for first-timers who get to binge watch it. I admit at times the show does leave you frustrated at times throughout the series. Such as when Luffy always ends up in the dumbest predicaments leaving him to get washed by low-level grunts who he should easily beat up other times he always somehow avoids the big fights until the very end. Zoro is another case who always gets lost and it makes you want to strangle him or tape a compass to his hand. Aside from doing little things like that the show does a very good job at making feeling a lot of emotion, like excitement during a fight or it makes you cry with its amazing storytelling, and it is especially good at making you laugh. Overall 9/10 Like I said at the beginning of the review this show is differently a journey you should start because you won't be disappointed. With its amazing writing that leaves you wanting more to its character that instantly makes you attach yourself to them to its evolved art style and sound that makes the scene all the more amazing. I promise you you'll feel every type of emotion with this show and it'll make you think that you're grateful you gave it a try. So by all means I recommend you try this show and experience a journey like no other.",9,Recommended,"May 7, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_49c3fde2f7,28,4254
"This is gonna be short review that might seem like I'm about to commit seppuku. By the way it might contain a massive spoiler so that i might get my point across I like One Piece it's an awesome anime with lovable characters and a great story line. The fights are good and the progression is at a steady pace but it really isn't for everyone, doesn't mater when you started watching it or at what age but it might not be for everyone and the reason I feel like such is its conflict/fights in it. This has time and time again got me frustrated to a point where i put off the show and get on a self put hiatus. People might say I'm being petty but it is really annoying, it feels like every fight they either have to stop and talk about their feelings or the good or bad guys trying and convince the either side that their way is best. I know most shounen shows do this but how one piece does it is to a frustrating level. Where my spoiler comes in is in the fight between Luffy and Doflamingo. Since this is after the time skip and a lot of episodes into the show you could say why is it that this particular fight is the reason I'm writing this review, well I always had a slight prick in the back of my mind when i watch the show and never really knew what it was about until i watching this sequence of episodes. The fight just drags on and on and never really reaches a point till luffy unleashes his bouncy man move. The reason this fight is so draggy are those that i previously mention and why i wrote the review is when i re-watched Naruto Shippuden and watched the pain fight. It blew my mind and i got chills, the exact same ones i got when i was in grade 9 watching it for the first time and then it hit me the way this fight is portrayed and done is so good. It give you the time for breathers and then throws you back in the action and if one piece could do this it might be skyrocket up my favourite anime list!",8,Recommended,"Apr 28, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_65abf4d884,28,1924
", no long summaries, only good words. Let me start of by saying that, the love I have for One Piece is beyond of what I could ever write down. I grew up casually watching the show since I was a kid, to binge watching all +600 episodes three times in total, until now, where I’m waiting for a new episode every (other) week for years and reading the manga as well, which the show is based on. Firstly, the world of One Piece is enormous, and I think THAT is what makes the show so unique. Oda’s strength lays in his flow of storytelling and the way he introduces new islands with its own history and its own folks plus new characters in every arc. Everything you learn, you learn slowly, for sure. However, since the world building itself is so unreal, it takes and actually NEEDS time for the viewer to fully understand and comprehend (reasons, explanation of different gears and powers, backstories, side stories, all involved characters and their reasons and backstories) without being completely overrun with new information every new episode. There is a reason for everything that is shown and Oda eventually explains why something happened this way and in that order. Secondly, every arc, hence, every character you will see and meet is different due to its own culture. While it might feel as the story gets drawn out, the chances that you actually forget an island and everything the arc consists of, is quite low. Thirdly and most importantly, Oda somehow manages to address real-life issues as racism, corruption (especially by the government), in/- justice, following your dreams and people that try to take you down, or even slavery, tyranny and murder, while still making it entertain to watch. Intentionally or not, it blows my mind. Additionally, you either fall in love with the characters or you don’t. There is not much character development, only a stronger bond between the crew members. Just to give you a perspective, the story begins with Luffy assembling the crew which already takes 300+ episodes, minus one who joins the crew another 500 episodes later. You will for sure find at least one character or side-character you will enjoy. Also, friendship is a big factor here which helps the crew to protect each other or even strangers that turn into friends when they are in danger, yet, every crew member has their own dreams and goals that they try to achieve and reach while still working as a team. Further, the filler percentage is thankfully very low but even those are funny to watch. The background music always fits well. The art style: an ongoing issue. Oda started out when he was pretty young and the adaptation of the manga started 1999/2000s. I actually really enjoy it, after the first 100 episodes you get used to it and after that, it continuously evolves for the better (minus the exaggeration of unrealistic body shapes for female characters). After all, One Piece is not only an anime but a life-changing experience and will forever hold a very special place. Thank you for reading! P.S: even if it means to watch, read and wait another 20+ years for the story to end, that ending better be gooooooooood!!",10,Recommended,"May 24, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e8ba78ab8d,28,3148

The Story is Awesome, my only problem with the story is the filler in the anime. From Episodes 1-206 I give the art about a 6/10, but starting with Episode 207 the art really improves as starting with this episode, the anime was in HD. The Sound and Music are good and the Voice acting is good nothing bad there. For the main I love there character! Luffy is dense but in situations he really is smart! Zoro is Bad-Ass even when he sleeps and its funny when he gets lost! And every other straw hats character are awesome to! The anime very funny and comedic, and the fights are awesome. I would have my favorite is the Enies Lobby Arc because I like how it told Robin's backstory and the fights through they show that all of the characters are useful unlike DBZ where Goku gets most of the spot light.

"One Piece is a pirate story centered around the Strawhat Pirates and their captain Monkey D. Luffy Story: The story is a fairly simple one yet amusing. A boy wished to be the Pirate king and step on the footprints of the previous pirate king Gol D. Roger, How will he accomplish his goal? By finidng the mythical teasure left from the former pirate king, the treasures name? One Piece. The quest starts w/ Luffy trying to recruit members for his crew and making his dream come true. His crew though has dreams too which can be accomplished by following the crazy meat-eater Luffy. Ahoy maety, time to set sail. Did I mention that Luffy has eaten the Gomu-Gomu no Mi which gave Luffy the abillity to stretch himself like rubber? What awaits as in the this Pirate world is a mystery yet to see it unfold to it's fullest. 8/10 Art: The animation is this anime is rather dull in the 1st part and get more joyful later on. It's nothing to be amazed at, but it doesn't let you down, We colorful setting and stuff and fanservice for both gentlemen and ladies. I'll say just two sentences for this and end this here. 1st part We get a flat chested Nami and on second part we get a BIG chested Nami. For our ladies? All males have a pretty muscular body which sometimes makes me wonder why I'm not like that. 6/10 Sound: The sound in this anime is quite good and relaxing or intense depending on the situtation. One Piece has usually good OPs and EDs but not to go crazy about which is kinda dissapointing for such a legendary anime. The OST can make you grow some feelings be it anger, laugh or being on the verge. 7/10 Enjoyment: If you like shounen type anime this is definitelly for you since it's fully action packed and has everything a shounen fan loves. The bad thing isn One Piece though is that the recpas are pretty damn annoying in he latest episoded cause they happen on each and every episode, that's riiight!

"The story of One Piece is interesting and sometimes engaging. The art is not really appealing and could use major improvements. The sound is not really special or catchy. There are very few songs that will make you cry or jump out of your seat. The characters in the East Blue arc have really heartbreaking and solid background stories. I like how all of them have goals that they want to accomplish. It is nice to see a group of characters with different goals, but overall the same purpose. Which is to help Monkey D. Luffy become the pirate king. Sadly, with all this said I'm still disappointed. I do not like how the characters are just brushed over and there is no expansion on their foundational stories. It feels like they are introduced, their stories are told, and then immediately cast aside as side characters. I would like to see them develop more and actually see the progress they each made to fulfilling their goals.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 1, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_2363683721,28,932
"I love One Piece. I love its story, the way they set a goal and deliver to their audience, the character developement, background... you get it. The thing is, I can not recommend this anime to anybody. All the things mentioned above are found in the manga and in the anime, but the latter absolutely destroys the hype, the pacing, and the viewer's eyeballs. So I just recommend reading the manga. The reasons I cant recommend it are the following: - As of right now, one chapter of manga equals one episode of anime, meaning that every anime episode is extremely slow paced and with excessively long and frequent freeze frames. - The animation is just dreadful... at the beginning it was fine, but around episode 400 the animation has gone downhill non-stop. And yes, I am aware that the animation gets better on the latest arc, but still, it's a good 500 episodes of thrash animation. It is really hard to watch something that you love get mistreated. That is why I decided to stop watching one piece and started reading it, the experience has been amazing so far, living each moment again, with proper pacing this time, and not feeling like I am wasting my time.

Overall I really think I would enjoy this anime if there wasn't so many episodes and the pacing wasn't bad people say to read the manga instead it has almost no filler and the pacing is a lot better.

"For a long time, which series has been heralded as the best shounen of all time? DBZ? Hokuto? Naruto? Yu Yu Hakusho? Well it's neither. Because One Piece is one such shounen. Story wise, it is one of the best. The arcs protrayed are unique and interesting at every turn, with Oda always finding a way to surprise the reader with curve balls. The world of One Piece is one of the best, never have I seen such a world ripe with originality and creativity. Art wise? It evolves over time in the manga, and the anime art is a bit stagnant, but when the good fluid art is called for, it gets called. Not as good as most shounen but hey, art shouldn't be the be -all end-all. Sound? It's...okay. Some parts are good and unique and fit the story, although the soundtrack can get repetitive and they haven't really added anything new in a while. Plus the OP themes are hit or miss for me. The characters are fun to watch and it's cool to see them grow. Luffy? He's wiser now after the Marinford War(in his own way. See Fishman Island arc). Usopp? More like MANSOPP. I don't want to go paragraph into paragraph but all the characters grow and seeing them bloom is great. Plus they are fun to watch, love, hate, and admire. Plus there is some good comedy. Enjoyment?

Roger marked the start the Great Age Pirates — thousands of people in the pursuit of their dreams went to the Grand Line, the most dangerous place in the world, wanting to become owners of a mythical treasure... But every year the romantics became less their gradually squeezed pragmatic pirates-robbers who loot was much closer than some «worthless dreams». But then, one fine day, a seventeen year old Luffy cherished dream has executed childhood — went to sea. His goal — neither more nor less than become the new Pirate King. Over the short enough term the young captain manages to put together a team consisting of not less ambitious adventure seekers. And let by them driven by completely different aspirations, most importantly, these guys are not as important money and fame, how much much more valuable — the principles and loyalty to friends. And yet — the service of a dream. Well, while on the Grand Line swim such people, the Great Age Pirates will always be with us! Brief introduction. The story itself, though quite simple at first glance, but it quickly evolved into something huge. Most of the very first episode focuses on team building and meet new characters. Although this is certainly not enough more action. But as soon as they catch up with the Grand Line, adventure go for adventure, and you can see a lot of fantastic-story arcs. Battles and fights well developed; fight the final boss is always completely full of epic. The episodes are full of lots of funny moments, not too much and not too little. There's always a delicate balance of action and humor. Design. At the expense of design. It is true, it is completely different from all the anime I've seen. But even so, you'll love it. Style change over time... still would! After a few years will pass and «One Piece» we will see in «new light». Cinematography (4:3) change in the anamorphic image (16:9). As a result, there will be more clear, bright, clean and colorful image. But despite these changes, the schedule 1999 has not lost its uniqueness and I love her still. )) Review. Some few years ago, «One Piece» promptly rushed into my life by becoming an integral part of it, decorate her own, unprecedented up to this point, paints. This anime was the ray of light, which I did not have all the time... a ray that shines to this day and will shine for me a very long time, if not forever. In fact, «One Piece» became my way of life, without exaggeration. In it there are so thin «highlight» that if the catches, then so thoroughly and deeply that permeates through the soul, and forget it ever anime, but rather that track that has left more than 350+ episodes of view, which looked at one go in record time, it is impossible. Of course, this is purely my personal opinion and experience. «One Piece» — is a constant drive that runs through you from head to toe. It's so crazy adventure, colorful characters, and a great atmosphere, I believe that «One Piece» One of the few things that can be considered perfect. At the moment, more than 678 episodes drawn, and it's not a terrible figure to show, on the contrary, each episode is so interesting and fascinating that when viewing exactly half of the episodes, you begin to frighten the thought that there is still the same, and in fact looks at one go and episodes of flying is not noticeable. «One Piece» — is one big pirate adventure story, with the supervision of that, you become a witness, unimaginable adventure through the red tape that goes the theme of dreams. This is another huge plus for the whole idea of «One Piece», for this many thanks Ode Eiichiro. Dream - it's an incentive to go forward, to make progress, as well as live. This motif is thoroughly imbued with the entire anime series and its protagonists, who are each his dream, but they are making it all together. To sum up the above logic, although I believe that I could write at length on several pages of this wonderful anime, the conclusion suggests itself: «One Piece» — a bright pearl among all the anime genre shounen and adventure anime-series. He remains in my heart for ever, and do not forget while watching another anime. Those who did not look — look, those who viewed themselves soon want to reconsider. Of course this is again my personal opinion, but, hell, «One Piece» — a masterpiece! Soundtrack. I want to give due attention to the soundtrack. He is a great! Not only OST's but OP&ED. General impressions. Best Anime and best Shounen who saw and probably ever will see. Anime rest on his background seems boring and predictable set of fillers... Finally. The most beautiful and noble of all the anime I've ever seen. I think that «One Piece» in Russian — a world of the soul. Verdict.

"This show does not deserve such a high score. Not anymore. For the longest time it baffled me that this was such a popular series in Japan. I caught glimpses of the 4kids dub on TV and was immediately turned off by it. Then in 2011 I actually knew some Japanese friends who liked the show and they eventually convinced me to give it a chance with the original version. I remember their claim that Oda (the creator) said the series would likely go on for another fifteen years. Given that and the fact that the show was already near the end of the Punk Hazard arc, or over 600 episodes, by the time I began watching, I was more than a little daunted by the whole undertaking. After giving it a chance, for several years I was obsessed. A huge fan. But, I don't know: I grew weary. Here's the short of it: For what it is, the story, and by extension the manga I assume, is quite good. It can really only be compared to other long-running shounen type shows, and in that respect it is much smarter in the construction of the story. Story beats and elements are thought through well ahead of time and not just pulled out of nowhere week after week. The characters are both likable and memorable. The comedic moments are funny, and the dramatic moments are really sad. The music is repetitive if you're bingeing the whole show in one go but it does achieve the proper effect on the listener in evoking a sense of adventure on the seas. Now here's where I give it mediocre score for enjoyment: The pacing gets abysmal after a while. The opening theme gets longer and longer with shittier music, followed by a secondary opening, and then a recap almost as long as the opening itself. Once you've caught up and you're watching the episodes premiere weekly it becomes even more of a slog. You've waited an entire week to see the continuation of the story and when the new episode finally drops you get like two minutes worth of content stretched out to fill 20 minutes. It feels as if watching the episode didn't even matter. As a result, almost no stand alone episode is good. Cumulatively the story is good, but this show would be so much better if they took time off to let the manga gain some distance from the anime. Another issue is the constant use of flashbacks to fill up time, sometimes entire strings of episodes are just flashbacks piled on flashbacks with a minute of new content. They used to bother me but lately not so much because often times it has literally been a decade or two since a scene they reference has premiered. I just don't remember what happened anymore. I'm going to continue to stick with the anime and not switch over to the manga, but that is not a recommendation for everybody. I hope that one day they release a ""Kai"" version of this show that gives it a more consistent style and has tighter pacing for the story. THAT I could give a higher score.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_953ba972f9,29,2877
"Many people tend to criticise One Piece by pointing out its rather lengthy episode list. Whenever I ask someone why One Piece is bad they either refer to the phrase 'I don't want to watch it because it's too long' or 'It's bad because it's too long' and in my personal opinion those are quite stupid criticisms. Yes, whilst the length of One Piece is quite long the whole journey of the characters is extremely intriguing to delve into. You easily get attached to each character and their development. Oda's genius writing skills really hook you in. Although the start of One Piece is quite slow, it's a good build-up into the epic journey the crew goes onto. The storyline and characters are just so unique and compelling. If I could pick an anime with the most interesting characters I would definitely consider One Piece as one of them. Each character is so unique and have their own traits that make them stand out to you. You feel yourself getting emotionally attached and rooting for a plethora of characters, even side characters that barely get any screentime. Another attribute that I love about One Piece is Oda's representation of real world problems, he portrays slavery, poverty, racism, injustice and how people we view as good authority figures hide so much from us and cause havoc. It's so heartbreaking and compelling to watch how characters struggle from such real issues. I would really recommend anyone who is too nervous to watch One Piece to give at least 20-50 episodes a try and drop it if they find it boring (which would be rare). For those who don't want an anime with suffering pacing sometimes, I would definitely recommend the One Piece manga (In my opinion one of the best mangas to ever be written)",10,Recommended,"Jul 9, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a8575b6e86,29,1730
"One Piece is overall, a amazing and alluring story. The story is really well thought of. It has its originality of Devil Fruits, Haki and such. Especially the Pirate Era, the shichibukai system and the 4 emperors of the Grand Line. Though it took inspiration from the anime ""Dragon Ball Z"" an Oda took some real life pirates and turned them into his own, taking bits of them into his characters. One Piece, as a long-running anime, was and is a very large piece of hard work. Oda has to keep it exciting with epic fight scenes, cliffhangers (Which I think he's amazing at), and emotional touching scenes. Oda is also really good at foreshadowing, because he has foreshadowed many things from the very beginning of One Piece up to even episode 500+. I do not wish to spoil any of those foreshadowing. Back to the subject, Oda makes One Piece successful by keeping the interest flowing (Which he does by the good plot lines of each arc) so that at the end of each anime/manga episode/chapter makes you crave more and more. But that interest will sometimes drop when the fillers come, though some of the fillers are also interesting and hilarious on some occasions. The interest also seems to fall rapidly because of the extremely slow pacing in any arc Oda makes. Like each big arc (Like East Blue, Alabasta, Sky Island), they all have more than 50 episodes. And 50 episodes is about as long as a year. That's why some people don't want to watch One Piece. But, if you have the patience to sit down and just watch, I can assure you, there is a very high change you'll enjoy One Piece, a lot. Art? No, it's not the best. At the beginning of One Piece, I have to be honest, the art was pretty bad. But remember this was drawn in the 1990's and they didn't have good technology. The story sometimes can distract you from the art so sometimes when the story gets good, you'll just get dragged into the story deeper and you'll forget everything about the art. Thankfully, the art improves greatly as the story progresses. The most noticeable improvement starts about around the Water 7 arc which is about episode 200 or so. By then, the story gets amazing good and you'll start to not care about the art. Then, by episode 500, the art is really good. Compared to episode's 1 art to episode 500's, 500 is like the king of pirates while episode 1 is a small frog in a well (Couldn't help but quoting Mihawk there XD). It still isn't the best animation but it still earns about a 8/10 by episode 500. One Piece has a very large variety of sounds that fit the scene super well. From the slurp of noodles to a cymbal clap. As for the soundtracks... 10/10, no question. Now I don't know about you but One Piece has many soundtracks that you could fall in love with and each scene in the anime, Toei Animation knows exactly what soundtrack it goes with and it fits so good, it's like finding the last piece of a puzzle and fitting it in, completing the puzzle. How do they do it? The soundtrack they choose is literally like finding a couple that were meant to be soulmates. The music can go to happy, then immediately go into a emotional melody. The openings are the same too. The first opening, ""We Are!"", is super catchy and I just can't help but sing along with it. And I love it when they make ""We Are"" with different voices or recreate it into a different opening. There are a total of 3 ""We Are"" openings. Actually, all of the One Piece openings are catchy and loveable. I also enjoy the narrations in the openings too! One of the best pros of One Piece is the outstanding character development. Each introduced character has a very unique personality. I don't think any of the introduced characters in One Piece have very similar personalities. That's just my opinion. Like Nami, who is pretty mature and takes things serious but then turns into a deceiving mischievous cat when it comes to getting money. Like Zoro, who is very strong but gets lost super easily even when someone is telling him directions. Sanji, who acts cool and is a great cook but loses his cool immediately when he comes across a pretty lady. And Luffy who is a drooling dog when he sees food but can be the most loveable, understanding, mature idiot ever. I don't know but Luffy knows the exact words that people need to hear. I really enjoyed this anime, as you can tell. My brother started watching One Piece about 4 months before me and it was all I heard him talking about. So, when Winter break started, I decided to start watching One Piece. My brother told me that in the beginning, One Piece was very slow but too me, like him, I fell in love with One Piece on the very very first episode. I actually caught up to episode 700 in a month. That's how good it was for me. Overall, I rate this a proud 11/10.",10,Recommended,"Apr 18, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_52517b30e8,29,4780
"I'm totally in love with One Piece. Years ago, my friend once told me that the top three best anime in the world were Bleach, Naruto and One Piece. Since I have watched Bleach and Naruto, I totally agreed that Bleach and Naruto were the best. But One Piece??? I was very doubtful at that time. Why? Because there's no way an anime that is childishly drawn could be at the same level as Bleach and Naruto. But my friend keep persuading me to watch One Piece and one fateful day, I tried to watch it continuously for one whole day. Oh my God!!! I was completely stunt! This anime is beyond my expectation. What an epic. For me, it was better than Bleach and Naruto. Now let's talk about the anime itself: STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward,a young boy Monkey D. Luffy(17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King,Gol D. Roger.Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates.The series is divided into arcs,each featuring its very own story and setting,each island,each place the straw hat pirates(Luffy and his crew)visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances.And that's one of the best things of OP,you never get bored.You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it.Everything is interesting and everything is fun,Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers.Thats something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly.Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series,especially Luffy,don't really care about their destination,hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all.All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things,get stronger,meet new people and face powerful foes.Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers(episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto,Bleach anyone?).Also the fillers are actually not that bad,sure they are not good but many of them are OK.And thats a huge plus for an anime series. CHARACTERS:This is where OP really shines.Each character is presented with great detail,they are all quite unique.Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are,why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams.Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other.We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other,they become something very close to a family.That's the kind of bonds they make.Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines.We see why they make the kind of choices they make.Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good.Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause,in their own justice and in their own dreams. ART AND SOUND:One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation.The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics.The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other(that's a huge plus in anime).The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors,I'm always talking about the original Japanese(don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters.The music,for me at least,is very catchy and actually really well made.However that depends on personal taste,if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it.Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime. OVERALL ENJOYMENT:One Piece is one of the most,if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find.It really excels in pretty much every field there is.It is the only anime series,or any series,I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me,have I seen a lot).I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure.If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not(oh you will want to continue).Trust me and you won't regret it,just like I did.",10,Recommended,"Jun 16, 2016",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fc7a7b63a2,29,4955

"The overall premise of One Piece isa that the world is divided between pirates and Marines! Constently at each others necks resulting in grand battles, exhilarting fights, tear- worthy moments, meaning a whole lot of snot! Such moving story lines, that truly make you fall in love with the characters, and become invested in their dreams and aspirations. If during this anime you don't get emotionally moved, then your most likely dead inside. As we watch our heros battle their harships and as we fanboy/fangirl over their sheer badassness moments that not even the biggest narutards can object to! If this review will get at least one person to watch One Piece than I'd write it a thousand times. The voice acting is fantastic, especially when emotional moments are demanding more. Themes such true companionship, following your dreams no matter the hardship, and truly putting your life on the line for what you believe in, are played out truly beautifully. Almost changing part of the person experiencing the world of One Piece! Hands down this is truly a wonderful adventure. If i had one wish is that One Piece's grand existence never disappears, because this anime/manga is importilised in the heart of it's viewers. By the first episode this 'Monkey . D.

"One Piece is one of those anime that really pull you into its world. It had me hooked from episode 1 and before I knew it 8 months had passed and I had caught up on its many episodes, movies, specials, and any other content I could see. Now every Sunday when the new episode comes out I'm like a kid on Christmas morning. I know I'll be sailing with Monkey D. Luffy until the show's conclusion. Story: 10 I gave the story a 10 because of how imaginative it truly is. Revelations and new developments in this story are constantly coming at you. This means the story never gets repetitive or boring. Additionally the story will have you asking yourself many interesting philosophical questions. Here are just a few of the questions this show may have you thinking about: What is Justice? What is good and evil? What is really important in life? What does it mean to be free? Better yet it does this without ever feeling preachy. The story also has great themes of friendship (friendships as strong as familial ties) and amazing adventure! Art: 10 The art-style in this show is really unique. It is instantly recognizable and fits the show perfectly. All the color really brings the expansive One Piece world to life. Character designs are all very distinct and some of the most eye catching in anime. The fights and all the special attacks are breathtaking. Sound: 10 The soundtrack in this show is extremely versatile and varied. It has pieces that fit every mood. The openings and endings all sound great. These tracks really provoke emotion. Songs that will make you smile ear to ear, songs that will make you sob, songs that make you feel tense and excited - It has it all! Characters: 10 One Piece really shines in this category. Every character has a distinct personality, motives, beliefs, and their chance to shine in the story. The cast of characters are extremely lovable and quirky. Monkey D. Luffy and his crew all have hearts of gold. Enjoyment 10: I find One Piece extremely enjoyable. It has everything I am looking for in an anime. It keeps me excited, invested, and completely enamored with the characters and plot. It pulls you into its adventure so well! Overall: 10 I would strongly advise watching this show. It is a time investment to watch all the way up to date, but I did it and it was well worth it to me. It is the kind of show that has something for everyone and so can be enjoyed by nearly anyone!

"This is a positive review. I am going to express my spite for many parts of the show in a brutally honest way, but overall I am arguing that this is a beautifully rare specimen of the world. The FLAWS of One Piece: 1) It is an epic, and it is dragging us around. It is too long and slow, and they want it that way: to keep us watching for 10 to 15 more years. (I personally think that the series could have had an open-ended finale at the Summit War) 2) It's a Shounen. We are all familiar with the flaws here, some weird race to ""who is the most powerful in the universe"", nonsensical arguments about the rankings of strength, Highlander ""there can only be one"" sentiments, shitty intro music, etc. What really irks me is that this has really gotten worse over time. The first few seasons are actually guilt free these problems. During the Skypiea saga Oda really signs the lease on a Shounen when enemy attacks have DBZ sound effects, and the action scenes are outsourced to fight scene specialists that botch Luffy's facial expressions (which are a highlight for me). 3) It's repetitive: as said in other reviews, every country they visit has more or less the same dilemma: evil ruler, Luffy kicks their ass. Except it takes 100 episodes. Every female character is mostly boobs, supporting characters have weird laughs, Luffy protects his nakama, and anyone who sees Luffy fight believes he will become pirate king, which is meant to keep the drug-addicted super fan on the edge of their seat for another 15 years thinking ""OH MAN IS HE REALLY GONNA DO IT??"" THE GOOD PARTS OF ONE PIECE THAT MAKE THESE THINGS FORGIVABLE 1) It's really fucking original and creative. On one end, the Shounen aspects seem unoriginal. But I don't think we can overlook the fact that the main character is a happy-go-lucky adopted straw-hat rubber-man, and he is but one of the hundreds of amazingly interesting characters. I haven't seen any other anime that unleashes the author's insane ideas as much as One Piece. In terms of content, this show is definitely one of the most unique I have come across. 2) The dramatic side is actually really interesting. Earlier I mentioned a shift in the show during the Skypiea saga. While I dislike much of the production quality that changed at this time, this saga added an additional layer to the show that I think becomes one of the reasons that keeps us watching. While each individual saga is predictable (mean ruler, Luffy beats them up, nobody dies), the overarching story has multiple levels of intrigue, and the length of the show is actually effectively utilized to create a multi-dimensional story arc. 3) The MOST important: the universe... it's amazing. The characters, the geography, the islands, everything. Since the show is so slow, I almost want to recommend the manga, but truthfully it's fun to see these ideas come to life with color, movement, and sound. While I have mostly talked about suspense, I would here like to say that One Piece is good because it is FUN. Despite the repetition, I think it's amazing to see Oda/Luffy/Roger's idea of what a pirate is: someone who sets sail in search of adventure. With that premise in mind, Oda took aspects of Earth and made them cartoony, dangerous, and exciting for Luffy to encounter throughout his journey. This craving of adventure sets an optimistic tone for the whole series, and while it is often cliche and predictable, that doesn't depreciate from my liking of the Strawhat pirate crew when they are already such a unique hodgepodge of individuals. I truly believe that buried in this crazy story, are Oda's opinions about how people should genuinely treat their human position. Any hesitance to watch the show due to the fact that its is already almost 800 episodes long is totally valid. But if you are capable of diving into a lengthy series, and are making the decision betweens epic sagas, I think that One Piece is the king (yeahyeah, funny) of this genre.",8,Recommended,"Mar 5, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bb31ebe401,29,3963
"Let's start by saying that i'm really really nostalgic about this anime. One Piece, after DB and Pokemon, was one of the first big anime that aired in my country post 90s. I fondly remember the Skypea and Enies Lobby arcs from elementary/middle school, and i think i could say it's, together with Dragon Ball and Maojin Guru (an anime that seemed to have disappeared from the collective memory but i really loved it as a kid lmao), the anime that really got me into this world. But, like for Dragon Ball, 15+ years later i'm forced to face reality and admit that, among the more mainstream modern ones, it's probably one of the worst adaptation ever made. Yes, it doesn't have the same amount of filler Naruto or DB has, but honestly i've never considered filler arcs that much of a problem, since you can always skip those. The fact is that, beside filler arcs there's A LOT of filer scenes in canon episodes, making them impossible to skip, and a lot of times those filler aren't just useless, but straight up ruining the story, for example Ace joining the straw hats in Alabasta (completely contradicting what is supposed to be the relationship between Luffy and Ace, that is of affection, yes, but also of strict mutual indipendency), and them finding a goddamn poigne griffe before they're existence was revealed in the MIDDLE OF THE DESERT (for real Toei? Are you really going to pull out such a bullshit ruining one of the most interesting and important plot point in all One Piece?). Graphically it has some great moments, especially in some of the most tense scenes (for example the celestial dragon punch was greatly made), but on average it isn't particularly good (especially when compared to the great style of the manga, very toriyamesque but still original in the beginning and very detailed later on), and sometimes straight up bad and weird. Of course the main problem, at the cost of being very unoriginal, is the dreadful pacing. One Piece is a long manga, no doubt about it, it will soon hit the volume 101, but that in NO WAY justify a 1000+ episodes series. The episodes/chapters rateo is basically 1:1. Now, sometimes One Piece, manga-wise too, is very slow, especially read chapter by chapter (i'm sincerely convinced most of the talk about ""One Piece decline after time-skip"" is due to the fact that the people that started to binge-reading the series when it was around Marineford had to start readng chapter by chapter and found it slow, but actually OP always had its slow moments). On the other hand read in volumes or binged the feeling is completely different. That's not really true for the anime tho, by rewatching some of it i really understood why Skypea arc (imo in the top 3 arcs in the manga) is perceived by a lot of anime-only fans as boring and skippable, because it is there, it's very slow and most episodes really feel like useless. I suggest anyone that could think this and have only seen the anime to try reading the manga, they'll notice that most criticism defenitely doesn't apply there. I didn't reach the anime version of Dressorosa because i'm no masochist, but i have to say that i got the chills down my spine seeing that a 10 volume arc (and already pretty low-paced) was in total 120 EPISODES. That's insane, there's no justification for that, any filler arc to let the manga catch up (or, listen carefully dear Toei, maybe even A PAUSE, yes i know it's a scary word that doesn't make you do katching) would have been better than such a choice. This obviously is an enormous smack on the enjoyment of the series, and i genuinely believe the only reason why i didn't notice this as a kid was because, well, the Dragon Ball anime had a similar problem and already accustomed us to this kind of production. But nowadays, that luckily anime air in seasons and the pacing isn't screwed up like it was (One Piece is the only one still produced that way), this aspect become way more evident. Let's finish with the sounds, here i had to make an average: the opening and endings of this anime are really top tier, incredibly iconic and brilliant. On the other hand most times i found the music during the scenes sometimes useless and sometimes really annoying (well, except when thet play ""We Are"", that will never not be cool). I would like to explain this using some examples: on one hand we have the two great Luffy/Nami scenes in Arlong Park, ""Luffy, taskete"" and ""Nami! Omae wa ore no nakamada!"". Those scenes are obviously great in the manga, and they are actually very very good in the anime too, the absence of music during these moments, with only some fleble background noises, with the music starting only at the peak of pathos are brilliantly realized. On the other hand we have the Robin ""I want to live"" moment, another incredibly iconic moment in the manga, that arguably even surpass in pathos Nami's one. In the anime? Not so much, specifically because of the music that doesn't really match the moment and wasn't really necessary in general. I get this will be the most controversial aspect of this review, since a lot of people actually prefer anime over manga for this specific reason, but i really don't see the necessity of it at all in a scene like this, it only subtract atmosphere. Since i really don't want to exclusively be negative on an anime that basically made part of the person i am now i'll close with the two only scenes that were actually extremely well done in the anime specifically because of the music/visuals relation, the end of Alabasta and the Sogeking theme song, those were top tier but sadly it's not enough to save this anime. If you take a look at my profile i gave the One Piece manga an 8, sadly when we go to the anime version i really can't go higher than a mere 5",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 9, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_20d5623feb,29,5766
"I just can't anymore. Every episode is just the same thing over and over. It's a show that had maybe 48 episodes at most of entertainment to provide but they just keep dragging it out. And I wish it was something warranties extending it. Maybe making new seasons about new characters, where it's just set in the same world. But this is a plot that should have a start and a finish but drags it out. I'm sad to say it's very reminiscent of what the 90s was to DragonBall series, it's an amazing intro anime that draws fans in and never, ever let's them go. You love it because you LOVED it, not because it's still great. You could skip a few dozen episodes and at most you just need a 5 minute intro to the new flavor of the week side characters. If this is your first animals, i don't judge you at all for keeping it going. There's a nostalgic feeling. Much like DragonBall and even Pokémon fans.

"I'm biased, since i watched it when i was a child, but i absolutely love it. it's not exactly for adults (read the manga instead if you are), but it's incredibly entertaining for young children. It's a bit gory too, but not in a shocking way. The storyline is frankly perfect. i do find it a bit sad that the female characters the crew currently has don't have one on one fights too often, but that's because one of them is currently too weak and the other one's too strong. the animation is also great (although i think it got a bit worse lately, based off the clips that i see on crunchyroll) but the fights are still really goofy and intelligent. don't get discouraged by the amount of episodes there are!",9,Recommended,"Jan 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4dc3907c65,29,708
"One piece is the richest universes of anime, mysteries that hold him during the work. Character development, dreams and beliefs are one of the best points of the job. The comic relief at the beginning of the job is good, but it can take some scenes unnecessarily. Another point is the lack of significant impacts in relation to deaths or tragedies that really impact history and events, which can cause much more impact or drama in scenes that are important for the development or landmark of the story, but this is an author's perspective that does not kills characters. Besides, it is an excellent work in development that is approaching its final stretch, recently completed 1000 chapters and we still do not know the greatest mysteries in the universe, that is, it still has a lot to say about this incredible mangá.",8,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_ce00f1d3fc,29,820
"One Piece Review – The Treasure of Storytelling In the vast ocean of anime, One Piece stands tall like a lighthouse—an enduring symbol of storytelling brilliance, thematic depth, and sheer narrative ambition. Created by Eiichiro Oda and first serialized in 1997, One Piece is not just a story about pirates; it’s a tale of dreams, freedom, found family, sacrifice, and unbreakable will. With over 1,000 episodes and counting, and a manga that's entered the final saga, One Piece is a cultural juggernaut that continues to shape generations of fans across the world. At its heart, One Piece follows Monkey D. Luffy, a rubber-bodied boy with a straw hat and an unshakeable smile, as he sets out to become the King of the Pirates. To do this, he must reach the end of the Grand Line and find the legendary treasure known as the One Piece, left behind by the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. But the story isn’t just about Luffy’s ambition. It’s about the journey—the people he meets, the struggles they endure, and the bonds they form. Storytelling That Ages Like Wine What makes One Piece special isn’t just its length—it’s what Oda does with that length. Each arc, no matter how long or short, adds a meaningful piece to the puzzle. From the comedic and heartfelt early arcs like Arlong Park and Drum Island, to the political and emotional roller coasters of Enies Lobby, Marineford, and Wano, the series continues to raise the stakes without ever losing its core identity. Every arc feels like its own world, with unique cultures, villains, and emotional payoffs. Oda crafts intricate lore that ties back into itself even hundreds of chapters later. A minor character introduced in episode 20 might return 500 episodes later with crucial information. This long-term storytelling rewards loyal viewers and rewatchers alike. Rarely does an anime so sprawling feel so cohesive. And when it comes to emotional highs, One Piece delivers like few others can. Whether it's Robin’s “I want to live!” moment in Enies Lobby, Ace’s tragic end at Marineford, or Luffy punching the Celestial Dragon to defend Camie, the show punches you in the heart while pushing the narrative forward. A Cast as Rich as the World One Piece’s greatest strength lies in its characters. Luffy is a refreshingly straightforward protagonist. He isn’t the smartest or most strategic, but his moral compass is so unshakably pure that even gods and kings must bow before it. He doesn’t want to conquer the world—he wants to explore it, and his charisma naturally pulls powerful individuals to his side. Each Straw Hat has a dream, and each dream feels worthy of the journey. Zoro’s vow to be the world’s strongest swordsman, Nami’s quest to draw a map of the world, Usopp’s wish to become a brave warrior of the sea—these goals might sound simple, but the emotional baggage behind them is anything but. Watching these characters grow, face their pasts, and support each other is one of the show’s richest rewards. Even side characters and villains are layered. From tragic enemies like Katakuri to grotesque tyrants like Doflamingo, Oda has a gift for making even his villains sympathetic or at least entertaining. And with political entities like the World Government, Celestial Dragons, and Revolutionary Army, the lines between good and evil are often blurred. World-Building Masterclass If Tolkien built Middle-earth and Martin built Westeros, then Oda has built a world that could rival both. The One Piece world is made up of a fragmented ocean with powerful currents, strange islands, and cultural diversity that mirrors the real world in exaggerated form. Each island feels like its own novel. Skypiea gave us sky warfare and religious oppression; Water 7 gave us political intrigue and shipwrights; Thriller Bark dabbled in horror and gothic tropes. This world is not static. The actions of Luffy and his crew ripple across the globe, changing governments, inspiring revolutions, and shaking the foundations of power. The world has a history—an ancient one involving a forgotten kingdom, the Void Century, and a mysterious group of powerful individuals known as the Five Elders. Oda seeds this lore subtly, building anticipation for answers that may only come hundreds of chapters later. Art and Animation Visually, One Piece can be a bit of a mixed bag. Oda’s art style is distinct—full of exaggerated expressions, quirky designs, and imaginative creatures. However, some early episodes suffer from dated animation and pacing issues. Thankfully, the quality improves over time, especially from the Wano Arc onward. Toei Animation revamped its approach with cinematic direction, fluid action sequences, and bold color palettes. Episode 1015, which adapts a crucial moment from the manga, was hailed as one of the best anime episodes of the decade. Still, One Piece’s greatest visual asset is its creativity. The Devil Fruits grant outlandish powers that fuel unpredictable fights. You’ll see everything from a man who can split his body like a jigsaw puzzle to another who can manipulate gravity. It’s cartoonish, sure—but that’s the point. One Piece doesn’t try to be cool in a traditional sense. It embraces absurdity, then makes you care deeply about it. Themes That Resonate At its core, One Piece is about freedom—the freedom to dream, to live by your own code, to fight for what you believe in. It’s about found family, loyalty, and the cost of chasing your ideals. It’s anti-authoritarian, often critical of corrupt systems and the people who uphold them. It asks tough questions about justice, revenge, and redemption. These themes are explored not through preachy dialogue, but through action, sacrifice, and choice. When Luffy declares war on the World Government to save one friend, it means something. When the Straw Hats burn their ship, the Going Merry, and cry together, it’s not just a ship—it’s a symbol of their journey. Flaws and Pacing No masterpiece is without flaws. One Piece’s biggest weakness is its pacing, especially in the anime. Due to its close proximity to the manga, Toei has often padded episodes with flashbacks and reaction shots. Some arcs that felt tight in the manga become sluggish on screen. New viewers may struggle with the sheer volume of content and the slow burn of early arcs. Additionally, some designs can be off-putting, and the humor—while charming to many—can feel juvenile to some. The sheer scope can also be intimidating. Watching or reading over 1,000 chapters is a major commitment, and One Piece demands patience and investment. Conclusion – A True Epic Despite these issues, One Piece remains a triumph of serialized storytelling. It is anime’s greatest long-form epic, a tale that rewards endurance with unparalleled emotional and narrative payoffs. Few works of fiction can match its ambition, creativity, or heart. If you stick with it, One Piece isn’t just a show you watch—it becomes part of your life. The Straw Hats feel like family. Their triumphs become your triumphs. Their sorrows hit you like cannonballs. And when they smile, it reminds you why you started watching in the first place. Final Verdict: 9/10 One Piece is not perfect, but it’s undeniably legendary. It’s a story that believes in dreams—and makes you believe in them too.",9,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c12fa67a94,29,7272
"On the bottom is my original review when I decided I was disappointed with One Piece. I stopped watching it in 2019 and decided I don't care about it anymore, but recently in 2025, I had the urge to catch up again on what I've missed. I started watching the One Pace version and in a few weeks I caught up on all I've missed. What I realized was that I was heavily invested in the series and in the end it had lead to a massive burnout. I liked every part of what I missed for the past 6 years and the way the story progressed really evoked feelings in me and I was able to empathize with the characters and was excited to see how things will pan out. Probably all the points I listed in my original review, now I don't agree with anymore. You can literally read my old review with inverted meaning and understand how I feel about One Piece at the moment. The story has progressed very well, it has become more mature, characters have evolved and their personalities as well. The happy-go-lucky story in the beginning that I liked and later missed since it started becoming more serious is something that was needed to happen and now I totally understand why. The way events are unfolding up to the latest episode at this time (1133), it means thing will become more serious and grand as they move on. I have actually become excited once again to see One Piece through to the end. I think at this point, I can say that the story of One Piece is and will be the most massive, exciting and well thought out story in any Shounen anime so far. All the conspiracies and mysteries will be well worth waiting for. To conclude my updated review, I want to express the opinion that it's possible for a lot of people to experience burnout from such a long story and feel like it's progressing really slowly. And what I've done without doing it consciously is probably the best way to deal with it. If you reach the latest episode and for a while you've felt like it's boring, slow and you can't wait to see what happens next, but feel like you can't stand the waiting, just give it a break. Give it a few years to evolve and while you wait do other things and watch other things and when you come back, you will definitely rekindle your excitement about One Piece. I don't know how many more years there are until One Piece is finally concluded, but I felt between Wano and Egghead, events started moving really fast with no place for fillers or fooling around, and that waiting several years for the last arcs to be animated (or drawn) will be worth it, so don't give up on it, just put it aside and come back later. This is my original review from February 2019: I started watching this in 2008 and I was immediately hooked on it. I loved every bit of it - the pirate theme, the art style, the characters, the story. It has been pretty much amazing until episode 381, or in other words - the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Up to this point, the plot lines of the arcs were really fantastic, the art style was good, the fights were engaging, I just couldn't wait to see the next episode. But after that point, where they were entering Shabaody Archipelago, the show somehow lost its ""magic"" for me. I suddenly didn't care as much about what happens next and the excitement was diminishing. At the time I didn't take notice of that, but around the time of writing this in 2019, I finally realized that I no longer care about One Piece anymore - I did not care about the characters, about the fights, about how the story goes on, I just kept tuning in every Sunday morning to watch the new episode, because it had become a part of my routine for over 7-8 years. Now the art style has changed and at first I was on board with with, but later on I started noticing that the unique character of One Piece is gone with this new style. The colors of everything look somehow really bright and vibrant, and yet, at the same time - really washed out and dull, especially now in Whole Cake Island Arc. Where everything is so colorful and yet it looks dull and boring. The cannon fodder enemies that get knocked out by the dozens and once and don't even have names used to look somehow more unique and quirky, now they look really generic and similar. The same observation can be made about the main characters and even the supporting characters, main villains and supporting villains. Enemies like Captain Kuro, Don Krieg, Enel, Crocodile, etc. looked unique and interesting, but now enemies like Charlotte Family who never made an appearance before look very uninspired, it's like the author wanted to make some random, generic weird characters for the sake of making weird and quirky characters, but he failed at making them unique. Even the art style of the Straw Hats changed from being quirky and likable to overly-perfect, refined and with that - somehow boring and unlikable. The story arcs in the first part of the series (up to and including Thriller Bark) were interesting and unique, but now they feel boring, prolonged and utterly uninspired. Even Dressrosa, which people praise as a good arc, I found it to be very boring and a drag. Arcs like from when Luffy fought Alvida up to Loguetown have been a precious experience for me that I will never forget. When they crossed Reverse Mountain and entered the quirky otherworldly Grand Line, everything on the excitement scale got turned to 893593548935843. It has been the most epic part of the series (all the way up to episode 381). Character development has been insignificant and at first that was okay, because the show remained happy-go-lucky without being boring, but by episode 870, the character development hasn't been very significant and coupled with the other (and growing) negative aspects of the series, it is becoming very hard to watch. Overall, I think that the author Eiichiro Oda's inspiration for One Piece has diminished or has completely disappeared. He probably only draws the manga with the only goal to finish it and retire. His passion seems completely gone and what made the anime/manga/series interesting and exciting doesn't exist anymore. At this point I've lost all interest to continue watch the series and will be dropping them, I'm considering moving to the manga at this point only to see how it ends. In my opinion the show stops being good after episode 381 and my personal advise would be to stop watching there and move to the manga. If you don't believe me, you can go ahead and continue to watch, but you will probably feel the same way like me after you catch up. EDIT: I tried reading the manga into Wano Arc and even that's boring and horrible. At this point I've completely dropped One Piece. I tried to rewatch it again from episode 1 to episode 381 with the original animation, but around episode 125 in Alabasta, I lost interest, not that it's bad, it's just not the same after seeing it.

"At first it seemed a little slow but finally things started to get interesting somewhere around ep. 50 maybe (the Loguetown Arc). I didn't even realize and I was hooked. Then, the pace started to get extremely slow. At the Dressrosa Arc (around ep. 600) I had to drop because, I don't exaggerate, it was so slow that it became painful to watch. It's a shame they ruined it like this, but I plan to continue with the manga, hoping for the best there. Apart from it's pacing everything is really good so I'd recommend giving it a chance. Maybe already start watching with the idea of having to switch to the manga halfway through it, so it won't be that disappointing that way.",9,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d0f569ca6,30,675
This is easily one of my favorite anime's with some of my favorite characters ever but I have some serious gripe with how I feel about the anime. I have literally stuck around since the beginning and I believe it has one of the stronger stories in anime. I feel it has been around so long without losing interest with people because the story and side arks lend to the main body and character evolution very well. However... the past I want to say 2-5 years the substance of the individual episodes have begun to feel like a dragon ball z power up episode. The introductions to each episode have become so long and boring you can skip the first 10 minutes of the episode and barely miss anything. With all that said when they eventually get to actually moving the story it has a great amount of silliness to emotional sadness that have made this a rather enjoyable show to watch.,9,Recommended,"Jul 13, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_94ebdc41b6,30,879
"After all the anime series I have watched since I was a kid, I was quite jumpy to browse any series that I wanted see based on the concept. Unfortunately, unlike any other people around me, I am not the kind of person who hopped on a hype train when it comes to the modern mainstream anime media. I am not driven to watch Spy X Family, Demon Slayer, or Oshi No KO, regardless of my nostalgic nerd or boomer nature. But I can agree that there some damn good anime series that are worth a watch such as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Hunter X Hunter, Death Note & Vinland Saga. Let me start by saying that as who enjoys anime as usual, I already met the requirements for watching Dragon Ball Z & Naruto. But I didn't watch One Piece at all, up to the time Netflix arrived. I can tell from the core to my heart I honestly got hooked up from the first few episodes and it brings me up to have the energy as an anime enjoyer. I am currently at episode 500 of One Piece and what do I have to about this? There is a reason why I have Luffy profile on my account. I guarantee you that even though it has more than 1,000 episodes, IT WAS A DAMN GOOD EXPERIENCE!

"One Piece....an anime I was so hesitant to watch for a very very long time, but now here i am writing a review about it meaning ive successfully catchup with the series (actually i catchup with the series almost 3 years ago). One Piece, an anime with a diamond solid fanbase ever since 1999 and manage to keep growing until this day. Also among the shonen title with lowest new watcher but somehow also the lowest to have ""dropped"" rate, which mean most people cant escape One Piece rabbit hole. To put it simple, One Piece is addictive. Lets look at One Piece as a whole again. In term of originality, none.....not a single anime One Piece story concept is derived from and not a single anime take One Piece as inspiration from. In other word, One Piece is the most unique and original anime ever existed until this very day, yes since 1998. Cant find any other anime with the pirate concept or having the same character design as One Piece does etc. One Piece was simply built different. But believe me, that is not the strongest point for watching One Piece. The strongest point or reason why so many trapped in One Piece rabbit hole is simply because of its ""story"". Naruto might have cool flashy fight scenes, Dragon Ball have their Sci-Fi diverse universe, Bleach have their cool looking character design and power...but lets admit none of this is as important as a good story. And there's One Piece which suck at most of these parts but exceeding in story perspective. Some might say the story pace is so slow and some might say the story is too frickin long. That obviously mean they dont even attempt to watch One Piece yet. Little did they know that for us who catched up with the latest eps regret watching One Piece so fast and now worried that the series will end sooner. To show how addictive and great One Piece is, unlike other anime where fans are looking forward for their fav anime ending, One Piece fans in the other hand wish for another thousand episodes. Just to show how desperate fans dont want the series to end because it is so dang good.

"One Piece is truly a masterpiece. The characters and the world they live in completely pulled me in. I’ve never been this excited watching an anime before. Luffy brings happiness wherever he goes and he really grew a lot during the timeskip. The world is incredibly vast and most islands have their own unique style, which makes every new place exciting to explore. Luffy and his crew perfectly represent true friendship. Their bond is the heart of the story and what makes it so special. The story is told at a slow pace but I actually think that works better for it. The fights are top-notch and always thrilling. The music is almost always great, and some songs especially hit hard during emotional moments. When something sad happens, I felt like I was part of the crew—I cried when they cried and laughed when they laughed. The only downside for me is the art style after the Wano arc—I didn’t like it very much. I hope it improves in the Elbaf arc or maybe it makes more sense to read the manga instead.

"The world-building. One of the things that keeps people from getting into One Piece is the length. The reason it’s that long is because Eiichiro Oda is the master of world-building. Each island the main cast travel to will introduce a new element to the story. However, whether it’s a new character, villain, government or piece of lore, Oda will take as much time as he needs to make sure that you understand before moving on to the next thing. If you watch episode 1 and then immediately watch the latest episode it would be like entering a completely different and confusing world. The characters. When thinking of memorable characters in anime, shows might have about one or two that you’ll remember long after finishing the series. 75% of One Piece’s enormous cast of characters won’t leave your memory as easily in the next foreseeable future. Like with the world-building, Oda takes his time to let you get to know the important characters so that when he goes back to the character you don’t go: ‘’fuck who’s that again?’’, you go: ‘’MY BOI IS BACK!!!’’. The anime. This has all been praising the story, which is prominent in both the anime and manga. But what are the pros and cons on watching the anime? The score. The music of One Piece is amazing, ‘nuf said. My favorite is Franky’s theme, give it a listen. The openings are also great, opening 1 is probably one of the most iconic openings (coming from someone with not as much non-mainstream experience so sorry if you think there are more iconic stuff). The shit. Let’s be real, the anime did go downhill after they stopped doing filler arcs and started stretching out episodes. When almost the entire episode is intro, recaps, and flashbacks then it’s honestly better to read the manga. Overall. As much as I love the One Piece anime with its soundtrack and iconic voice acting, I’d say read the manga and then watch the anime when you’ve finished a story arc. DO WATCH the anime but the manga is better in the end. If manga isn’t your thing then watch the anime. It goes downhill with dragging out episodes about halfway (keep in mind halfway is like way over 500 episodes in) but before that it’s amazing and the filler arcs are pretty okay although skippable.",7,Recommended,"Feb 4, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_98cff1cf70,30,2228
"Let me start off by saying this; I am watching the dub, and it is not as bad as people make it out to be. It's a classic, and deserve all the love it gets. I have seen some people criticising the art, however, the art match the vibe of the rest of the anime. The anime has an ongoing story, that has a new plot every time, making it interesting all the time. The music can get a little repetitive, but it is good overall, as it is only played in low volumes, giving life to the scenes. Often, I watch animes, and the music doesn't fit the scenes 100%, however, it flows very natural in One Piece.

"One Piece, a sea of pros and cons. If you are thinking on starting One Piece, maybe this review can help you to taking a decision. To clearly expose my ideas I will structure the review by dividing it into two blocks. Pros: If there is something to spare in One Piece is epicity, giving unforgettable moments for a true fan of the series, but if there is something I love One Piece are the ""comebacks"". The moment in which a character that you had almost forgotten reappears unexpectedly (even after hundreds of chapters), whether or not it is very important for history, is simply magical. Another aspect to praise is humor, which is generally acceptable (although sometimes it can be sometimes repetitive, especially the one surrounding Sanji). In addition, the context of the story is well built, a world that must be explored little by little, with a system of powers (the three great factions) that are gradually explained as the story progresses. Last but not least, all the mysteries and riddles that arise and are not solved until the right time, leaving you an anxiety that encourages you to continue seeing it. In short, Echiiro Oda is a genius playing with the time. Cons: Here comes the ugly part of the review. The first, the filling, and I do not mean the chapters that do not follow the manga, but for example, endless battles that can last 3 or 4 chapters, and personally this has made me insufferable many on many occasions. Another reason why One Piece can irritate is the large number of characters that can simply be summed up in their ability and their phrases that they repeat constantly. These characters also tend to be quite flat and with a personality without any depth, which can sometimes be funny, but almost always makes them boring and predictables. NOTICE, the next paragraph could be considered spoiler! My last complaint is about the death of important characters. In One Piece the main characters (at least the mugiwaras) are like untouchables, and while a fight you, do not feel fear for them, because you know with certainty that they will not die. Now I am watching One Piece in streaks, it is an anime that requires a lot of time to see it and that sometimes I can't stop watching and sometimes I need to take a break. Despite its flaws, it remains a legendary shonen. Sorry if i made mistakes writing, english is not my native language.

One piece is something i like many other people said i could never watch because it is to long and i feel like i would be bored. But i still gave it a shot and started watching and boy am i glad i did. The art is not amazing the story is not the most special thing but the charachters and world building in this series is amazing. I have not seen this much charachter development and amazing backstories for every charchter before. The characters can be extremly annoying at times for me mostly the long gag of someone in the crew punching someone else in the crew for the stupidest shit but otherwise it is good. And it may be long and i may have skipped countless minutes in the span of the 911 episodes i have watched but when you finally get to the emotional and amazing parts it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo worth it.,10,Recommended,"Jan 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bc0c3e142f,30,825
"*A few spoilers ahead One piece is truly an energetic, exciting and binge-worthy anime. The animation has improved. I rewatched some episodes from the beginning and it interesting to see how sharp and clear the animation became. The characters have grown a lot throughout the years and the viewers are able to see their progression in their abilities and maturity. The original seven crew members are the best in terms of strength. Luffy, Zoro and Sanji are the strongest, then Franky, Robin and Chopper, and then Brook, Nami and Usopp (the weakest). Additionally, I feel the series was better in the beginning.The attack against CP9, the Alabasta Arc, the fight on Fishmans' Island, the fight against Gecko Moria and the Sky Island has brought the Strawhats closer, and then being separated for two years allowed for their development. Getting to know each character and their tragic pasts made the story much stronger. The return of many important characters won't list them here happens past 700. Luckily, we know that Jimbei may or may not be joining the Strawhat crew. he last two hundred episodes were a bit exhausting. It's the same thing over and over where Luffy fights a strong character and almost gets destroyed but then wins. My least favorite character would probably have to be Usopp. He provided no support or backup the whole time on Dressrosa and all he did was scream for backup. His character development hasn't many any strides since the first 300 episodes it feels like. There are some surprising elements that I feel made the story less tight recently. Usually the story is more tight. It was shocking that the whole crew didn't attack Big Mom's Island - instead Luffy took Nami, Brook and Chopper who aren't the strongest. Zoro should have been there along with Franky. Also, the fact that Sanji was related to the ""elite"" Vinsmoke family should have been made much more prominent at the beginning. I just feel that the story is a bit unraveling and isn't as concise as it used to be. Overall, I've fully enjoyed watching One Piece since middle school. It has stayed with me for a really long time and I still feel attached to the story. I was surprised to hear that the anime has no future ""end"" yet though I'm glad I can keep watching it for awhile now.",10,Recommended,"Nov 6, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9bb5ae77a9,30,2279

I really enjoyed what I've seen. Now I am at Water 7. Overall my favourite arc is Skypiea. East blue was a great start. Orange town and Syrup Village were kinda boring but ok. Alabasta was a very good saga. I almost cried at Chopper's backstory. I am waiting to see Robin's backstory, too. Little garden was ok and Whiskey Peak was funny. Zoro vs 100 men.

"My best anime ever, granted that it has been too long for this anime to close out its ending. It has that appeal for me to seemingly want it to go on as long as it can. I love the adventure that it has shown me, the characters, the depth, morals and the nature of life itself. I find it sad that other people have rated it so low but that may seem justifiable as it clearly began 24 years ago which appeals to the older generation. The new generation does not appreciate the old art, but to someone like me the old art was the present. It was one of the fresh arts of its form and I appreciated it as it was, as opposed to how the newer animes look today with impeccable CGI effects and what not.

"i was one of those people that said i would never watch one piece because of how long it was. curiosity got the best of me and i also thought it was a good idea to begin watching all episodes before it hit 1.000. At the start, it was only for curiosity and i ended up liking it so far but then i took a long break from it watch another anime. this month is when i got the idea to continue my one piece journey to watching before 1000 and so far, i am doing a good job at it! some people might not find it as their cup of tea but as someone who loves action, I’d give this a solid 9.2/10. deducted points are obvious for killing off my favorite characters lolz (and for the repetitive sounds). the art style isn’t weird i don’t know why people use it as a reason as to not watch it. i would rather watch animes of different art style than the same one over and over again as seen as most newer anime’s. the characters are sometimes likeable i’ll give them that. don’t let the art style or the amount of episodes or people saying it’s trash but haven’t even watched it get in the way of you enjoying this show! it’s up to your taste and if you don’t enjoy it, that’s completely fine. have fun watching!",9,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_02855e59d3,30,1200

"The manga is a 10 for me. The anime could have been something better but no, Toei just had to ruin it with that pacing. The pacing issue causes the anime to deviate from the source in small but significant manner. And I can't believe people still defend it saying things like ""Hey the animation quality is good now so its fine"", ""The dragging on is better because it adds to the enjoyment"" or ""they have to do this as it will catch on with the manga"". That's utter BS. One piece is not the only anime that has the problem of catching up to the source material but no other anime adapts HALF A CHAPTER of the manga in ONE EPISODE. This is nothing but a massive disappointment.

See wano has GREAT art but now kinda shitty animation however in contrast the pre-time skip era had GREAT animation but shitty art. And yes I am aware that none of this is oda's fault, it's toei's. See the manga art gets a 10/10 but toei is toei so they ruin it. Story: Ahh yes the single longest story I have every had the fortune to read/watch.

From alabsata to dressrosa to fishman island it has a variety of villains and yet Luffy and crew almost always win. I love this story! I will say however there was one arc I was not fond of and that was Punk Hazard. I found that arc boring and bland but aside from that one arc it is great. Characters: Well where do I start? There are thousands in this anime. There are just so many and they are all so different. Many of the side characters could each have their own manga or anime. A short(ish) one yes but their own. I think that alone says how great they are. If shanks were to have his own manga then I would be reading that thing so fast you'd think I was the flash. Or if ace or sabo or whitebread or maybe vivi.

"Lowering the MAL score is what I did when I was disappointed with Gear 5 Luffy, it's not that I hate the jokes in this anime series, but the joke was told at a critical moment which was not appropriate, it should have been seriously thrilling because that moment was the end of the Wano arc where the fight was the one you had been waiting for. after hundreds of episodes of this series and really this is a big mistake in my opinion. I like Sanji's joke about beautiful female characters, I like the joke where Zorro is always lost or blind, I like Luffy with his silly behavior and I like when Luffy is serious in fighting for his friends and ideals, it looks very cool and that's not me the discovery in the wano arc when gear 5 is active looks like a disgusting joke very disappointing. What I heard was that the author was inspired by the Tom and Jerry parody series, which was too forceful in inserting it just to get a fresher and new reaction, but actually killed one of the elements of the main character who always looks cool, like the main hero in many action stories with unfounded ridiculous behavior, which I think I don't know what's funny about the context, there are silly scenes like the Disney series in serious battles in the One Piece world?! Wano arc Wanting to achieve a plot twist, it actually became the worst plot twist in the time I have watched a lot of anime so far, my advice to the author is to better consider carefully the right moment where to place the right joke, where to be serious in battle or where the right moment is. sad scenes, a complex story will be created that is relevant from the beginning to the end of the story. If you force extreme thoughts into the framework of a story that has been mature for hundreds of episodes, it actually kills one of the important elements of the main character of the story, that is a futile action. So consider it more carefully, I don't hate authors who want to surprise their fans, but don't be so extreme that the fans become ignorant of your work. Honestly, when I watched the Gear 5 action, what I felt was not funny, not amazed, amazed, not epic or cool, but actually really disappointed, speechless and lazy about watching it in the future. So don't destroy fans' hopes just for a moment's extreme thought, it's easy to destroy a good work but it's difficult to build a work from scratch until it becomes a brilliantly good work. Update : In addition, it seems that I will lower my rating of this One Piece manga/anime again, because I am increasingly disappointed with the storyline where the supporting character, namely ""bonny"" in the egghead arc, easily becomes overpowered by imitating the power of gear 5 without any effort and training. This is very different from the main character Luffy who struggles to train and develop his strength step by step with all the obstacles and strong enemies.

"The prospect of watching through One Piece at this day and age is daunting, to say the least. Past 800 episodes at the time of writing, joining the One Piece hype train can seem impossible; however, if you even think you might be interested in the show, please pick it up. Allow me to explain why: The story of One Piece is an exploration of a world which has more layers than I hazard to comprehend. Shows which run even an eighth of the length of One Piece often make the mistake of presenting the world in a way where each new segment feels like it was made up for that arc, with hardly a thought beforehand. One Piece, however, unfolds its story and interlocking parts in ways which feel like a rug rolling out before the viewer. The flow of the story feels natural, and One Piece is notoriously good at playing the long game when it comes to characters, places, or information becoming relevant. It's a masterful exploration of how to build a world and then fill it with a story which adequately satisfies the grandiose and the intimate. (10/10) The art of One Piece, however, suffers greatly. As a TV anime--a TV anime which has aired practically weekly since 1999--it is subject to having to make do on a lower budget than preferable, leading to a lot of dicey background drawings or long-distance drawings. It has shining moments, but it is largely merely adequate. I can comfortably say that if you want to experience One Piece as a visually impressive art form, you are better off reading the manga, which is a masterclass in how to panel a visual story and, by comparison, puts the anime to shame. (6/10) I have a very soft spot in my heart for the sonic universe of One Piece. Whether the staff which helped put together the first effects and insert songs for the show knew they would be in this gig for the long hall, I do not know; I do know, however, that they have played the long game just as well as Eiichiro Oda himself. A tracklist for an episode today may have two songs introduced in Romance Dawn, two tracks introduced during a Grand Line arc, and two tracks introduced during a New World arc. With nearly two decades of material to recycle, One Piece could easily make do with what they already have; but Kouhei Tanaka and the sound design team are constantly working to outdo themselves and boost the anime to new heights by means of their labor. In episode 826, for example, an entirely new arrangement of the series' very first opening was brought in for an emotional moment, and it quite actually left me in tears. We may never have a long-running series again in our lifetime that will have the opportunity to use music and sound in the same way that One Piece has. Toei's team has taken an area that many overlook in long-running shows and turned it into an integral part of the world and storytelling of One Piece. (10/10) The characters of One Piece are without peer. Without exception, we see each and every main character at their best and their worst. It's easy to fall in love with an ensemble when you're with them for over 800 episodes, but the humanity and power behind the interactions of the Strawhat Pirates and the people they come in contact with are to die for. (10/10) One Piece is a romp which does anything and everything you could want in a show. You will laugh, cry, leap from your seat, and cheer for this series. On more than one occasion, I have gone back to rewatch an old arc once I had caught up to a current arc, and the wealth of callbacks in the show thoroughly rewards viewers who make sure they are up to date. (10/10) Though its art is lackluster, One Piece is practically the perfect battle shonen. If you like action, adventure, fantasy, or a good drama, One Piece has it all in spades.

The world itself is always moving while our cast are which is a major plus over other long-running series which seems to have the out-side world frozen in place. One Piece is a living breading world which constantly has fans creating theories and going over every little detail with a fine-tooth comb, something the author clearly has planned for again and again and again.

"First Impression: Wayback early 2000’s when One Piece is televised in our local television. When I first saw One Piece what the f*ck with this character with unusual figure long legs, long arms, big head and what the hell is with the MC with expanding arms and legs and neck. Its so lame that nothing compare to naruto and ichigo. And the story is so simple the MC just wanted to be pirate king he doesnt want to save the world from big evil antagonist or something. I dropped it 5 min after watching it. 10 years later after keeping up with big shot anime like Naruto and Bleach I give it another shot. After watching it and reading the manga I have an awakening this anime is probably the greatest anime/ever. Story: Its amazing that its already more than a decade but the story doesn't degrade and just getting better. One Piece is like RPG games where the author is the player and we are the audience. Every chapter discover new area, he unlock new character, new power, new discovery and another new mystery. Every time we discover something new we unlock new achievement. It amaze me how he manage with the number of character and keeps their connection. With the massive story and numerous character development there are still many things unknown within the story that make the audience to want it more. Art: Very unique artstyle. When you see a drawing you can tell if its one piece reference due to its unique drawstyle that become its own trademark. Character: Its a wonder how the heck the author manage so many character with very unique characteristic and own backstory. Sound: Very memorable OP and ED. Enjoyment: I can rewatch it many times.

My advice is don't watch this anime because of the story but rather for the characters. The drama between all the characters is what makes this anime more enjoyable than other anime. So, no wonder they made 900+ episodes just to make the audiences feel more understanding and more closer to the characters personality and feeling in every arc.

"I hate trying to review one piece because if i reviewed it around episode 300-400 then I would probably give it a 9 while reviewing it when fully caught up (read the manga starting from episode 540ish) i'm struggling to give it a 7. The beginning of one piece sets up so many interesting things and has tons of great moments. The main cast is all likable and plenty of the side characters are great as well. The villains are usually pretty meh but most of the time everything else makes up for it. Also most of the time you're excited to see what some super hyped up villains will be like so you aren't even thinking about how bad some random insignificant villain they are currently fighting is. A lot of one piece relies on hype that has developed over many many episodes, but my main issue with the show is that it almost never lives up to that hype. So many long term mysteries end up being extremely disappointing or just boring as you begin to learn more. Cool villains or new abilities that are hinted at early on end up being predictable and yet again, boring. The more you learn about the world of one piece, the less interesting it gets. Anything you probably imagine when you first hear about some cool concept in the world is probably far better than what the concept ends up being like. Some things which you think will get an explanation end up just being never explained and any potential for a future explanation is shut down (such as some characters being able to just fly through the air practically by kicking through it for seemingly no reason). That is all probably my biggest problem with one piece, though there are 2 other big problems id also say exist. The second big problem with the show is that is rarely ever shows anyone dying that isnt a flashback. I'm not even talking about just major villains or main characters, I mean anyone at all. We rarely even see villains killing random people in the present, and we never see the main cast killing anyone even though they have never once said or even hinted at having an aversion to killing villains. Plenty of times they'll just leave a villain on the floor after beating them without even tying them up or anything, and then that villain will obviously get up from the floor and cause big problems either in the same arc or much later on. Plenty of times you'll think a minor side character will be dead and they'll even have this sentimental death scene, though then they'll just be inexplicably alive. This also makes it so that when someone really does die, the scene is sometimes ruined just because you don't believe they're actually dead. This problem is not nearly as noticeable early on and is again something that you really start to see being a big issue in the latter half of the series. The third and final big problem in one piece is that after the time skip happens the characters are all suddenly significantly worse. Luffy is originally portrayed as naive and impulsive but not legitimately stupid, though later on he seems to only get dumber and dumber. Other characters who were originally shown to be both cool and also funny, get turned into nothing but a gag character and they rarely get any good moments. Plenty of people just don't do things anymore and getting a significant character moment for any of the main crew is an extremely rare occurrence. Some characters might get an extension to their original backstory that is just worse in every way to what they originally had. The crew rarely has interesting interactions with each other anymore, and they never have any sort of conflict with each other despite them having had it before. TLDR; The first half of one piece is really good but as you learn more about the world it begins to seem more shallow than you likely originally thought, characters (including nameless background characters) don't die nearly as often as would logically make sense, and every character just gets worse about halfway into the series. If I just stopped watching/reading the show after about episode 400, it'd probably still be one of my favorite shows though after seeing what it turned into its hard to think of the good without thinking of the bad.",7,Recommended,"Dec 2, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b501a4f9b,31,4191
"This is a must watch for any fan of anime. While the length can be off-putting, what you gain is worth it. Reasons to watch: . The world building is second to none and it truly feels like your part of it . The characters are all well developed and interesting with great backstories . The fight scenes are immense and brutal at times . The villains are all interesting with their own individual and pretty original backstories and reasons . I don't know if it's just me but i love the soundtrack and honestly think the pre-fight hype songs are the best out there . And the best bit it that is doesn't seem like it's ending anytime soon :) I honestly believe when this does finally end it will go down as one of the best animes/ mangas of all time. It's hard to believe there is still so much we don't know about the world and i cannot wait until all my questions are answered. Despite all this the first few arcs of One Piece can be quite boring and might not draw you in. However, after that i promise it gets more interesting and you won't be let down. Furthermore, it should be noted that the manga is widely considered better than the anime and if you up for the immense read i'd recommend reading it. Overall, despite all it's imperfections with some arcs, the charm of this anime is so amazing i cannot recommend it enough if you have the time. Hope this helped :)",9,Recommended,"Sep 25, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_880367cea6,31,1370

"The first thing anyone who wants to watch One Piece should know(And I'm assuming most do) is that it is quite lengthy, currently clocking in at 905 episodes, with no present sign of stopping. (I'm currently at episode 800, myself) I think it does a fairly good job of fleshing out characters, giving them their own personal strengths and flaws - like the inability to have any sense of direction, even if they can physically see where they're trying to go; or an irrational obsession with treasure. I don't think it really skimps when it comes to the crew; there's several of them so I think it would be easy for some of them to fall to the wayside. One thing I enjoy the most about One Piece, is that it tends not to take itself overly serious. That's not to say there aren't tense moments, bits of drama, or whatnot, but it tends to skew a little in the direction of lighthearted. I think Luffy is a great main character, because he tends to act a bit goofy, but still has his own personal idea of what he wants to do as a pirate, and where he desires end up in the world. He's straightforward and doesn't waver on his target - he protects his crew and works to become King of the Pirates. I'd recommend anyone who wants to try out One Piece, to at least dedicate themselves to watching the first 'Saga' which ends with episode 61. It would give you a real feel for the story, and have time to suck you in or spit you out. I would warn anyone that wants to watch this; be wary of burning out watching it. I burned out at episode 791. I think if you're going to watch this, you should stop after every Saga or so, and watch something else, even if briefly, to let what you've seen process and give your brain a break. All in all, One Piece is my favorite Anime to date, after decades of watching them.",10,Recommended,"Oct 11, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_18973899f2,31,1802
"""Deep into the Grand Line"" Ohh One Piece how you continue to impress me with your mind blowing adventures, awesome fights, character development and overall remaining fresh from arc to arc. Honestly, and I mean truly One Piece might be my favorite anime of all time. However, I do love my cyberpunks anime but One Piece just never seems to bore me whenever I start watching again where I left off. Eiichiro Oda is a mastermind and I'm just amazed of how he brings these characters together and how he comes up with these amazing arcs! I love everything about One Piece and I understand why it's so successful. On the other hand, there are some people that might not agree with me and that's ok. However if you're new to One Piece, please don't get hung up on how long it is. Take your time with it. Because there's no way a story like this could've been done in 60-80 episodes. And frankly, there's no reason to. Watch this masterpiece of storytelling with a open mind and let Luffy and his Straw Hat Gang take on a adventure unlike any other.

"The thing most people criticize about One Piece is it´s length, for me I was able to watch all of One Piece during the lockdown in one month. While watching One Piece it got better and better until it became my favourite Anime and here is why: 1. Story 10/10 1.1 Story in general It is a shame that it seems like many people quite don´t understand the story of One Piece. For a show running for over 2 decades it is impressive that there are no plot holes, the story arcs all build on each other and give the viewer more and more insight into the world of One Piece. One Piece also, unlike other shonen, talks about the dark sites of society, it talks about slavery, racism, korruption and many more things you wont see in anywhere else. The story grew up with it´s viewers from a childish show for kids, to a show anyone can enjoy with everything from funny aspects to pure cruelty. 1.2 Storytelling/pacing This is one thing that is criticizable about One Piece, it has a very slow pacing, especially in the anime. But unlike other big shonen it has a very low amount of filler with 13% or so compared to almost 50% in Naruto and Bleach. But this low amount of filler comes at a cost, the anime, to prevent getting too close to the Manga, has to stretch it´s episodes which leads to a slow pacing. This slow pacing sometimes feels a bit boring but for most of the time the show is so exciting, that you are surprised when the episode is over because it felt that short. 2. Art 9/10 2.1 Artstyle The artstyle of One Piece is very unique, this is a bit uncommon at the beginning, but you will get used to it very fast. Man ypeople are arguing that the artstyle would be bad, but it just isn´t your generic Anime artstyle, it is something special. 2.2 Animation The quality of the animation varies from a 6/10 (f.e. at the beginning of the show) to a 10/10 (f.e. Wano Kuni). Sometimes One Piece has a very low quality in animation, this is a result of it´s weekly release. But for most of the time the animation quality is very good. There are also episodes where the animation quality is just godly (f.e. EP 983). All in all the animation quality is very good most of the time. 3. Sound 10/10 3.1 Opening/Ending One Piece has very good Openings and many of them are practically unskippable like f.e. Dreamin on, Hope,... In terms of Endings, one Piece hasn´t had any kind of Ending for quite a while. 3.2 Ost One Piece got some of the best OSTs I´ve ever heard (f.e. the very very very strongest, Overtaken,...) The quality of the sound is very high and fits perfectly into the scenes. 4. Character 10/10 4.1 Characters in general One Piece has a high amount of different characters and all of them are very likable and even have their own Backstory. For a show with so many different important characters it is amazing how nearly everyone is explained in a way that you keep them in mind, even if they only appear for a short period of time. 4.2 Character design All the characters in One Piece have their own unique design, there aren´t any characters who look similar (expect siblings of course). The different designs of all those characters are one thing that makes this show so good. I think in this show, there is at least one character the viewer can identify with, which leads to a very unique experience. 4.3 Character Developement Every main character has his/her own unique developement through the show without losing his/her traits he/she had in the beginning. As an example I will take God Usopp, he has undebatable one of the best character developements in all of Anime. In teh beginning he wasn´t brave at all and really annoyingand childish. But with the developement of the show he became braver and more grown up until he became a very likeable character. 4.4 Villains The Villains of One Piece all have their own unique Backstory and goals. You can understand why they are doing what they do and you can sympathise with them. But they still keep their evil traits. One thing One Piece does really well is the contrast of Pirates and Marines, you can´t tell which one is evil, because the Marines think they work for the good site, aswell as the Pirates/Revolutainaires. 5. Enjoyment 10/10 One Piece is something you wont experience another time, it is a great adventure you get closer with the characters and overall One Piece is a big Adventure noone should miss, it is unique in its own ways and for me it was the best experience in my life. 6.Overall 10/10 7. Summary One Piece is an Adventure on it´s own. Everyone should give it a try, because it´s clearly worth it. It has very unique characters, probably the best story you will find anywhere and the Sound is incredible. The Animation quality might vary from time to time, but it is always on an adequate level and on it´s peaks it .s just amazing. For People who consider watching this show right now, I suggest to watch at least until the End of Arlong Park (Ep 60)",10,Recommended,"Aug 3, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d3400a6e4,31,4946
"(DISCLAIMER: I am going to be talking bad about One Piece. I know this is a sin and so if you must, avert your eyes.) Like many others, I really did not want to watch this for the longest time. I tend to be really skeptical of shows that everyone else likes mainly because I know how weird my tastes can be. Furthermore, starting this would seem like the biggest chore just because of the sheer amount of episodes. One Piece has been airing for over two decades with almost 1000 episodes and counting. I did not want to watch that many episodes. However, after giving this show a preliminary chance, I can say that One Piece was a somewhat enjoyable experience. The story is about pirates on a mission to seek a treasure that no one dares to venture for: the One Piece. It has a nice start to it and we see some small character development immediately from Luffy, the main character, as he searches for members to be in his pirate crew. The plot is relatively interesting and can keep you wondering what happens next. However, I was just left utterly disappointed in it regardless. Unfortunately, One Piece was far too over-hyped for me to the point where I developed astronomical, unreasonable expectations that it could not hope to meet. The art and animation is dated, obviously, but is still good at doing its job. I do like certain aspects of One Piece's artstyle and can see its charm and appeal. In a similar vein, the music also gives it charm. The use of the brass and strings in particular makes the soundtrack seem painfully late-1990s/early-2000s. I don’t have much else to say other than it works well with the scenes its in and that it makes watching the show that much more bearable. Some of the songs can be rather catchy and hard to get out of your head, so I suppose that is a positive. What's not a positive, however, is how godawful the pacing is. I recognise that this is a very popular complaint, but it is also not completely unfounded. You see it quite a lot with in One Piece with fights that are extended through ridiculously-long wide shots, background commentary by uninvolved characters, repeating shots (both in and out of recaps), and much more. Like a lot of longer shounen, this is extremely slow-paced and takes a while to introduce the main elements of its plot. Ask any One Piece fan and they will tell you something along the lines of, ""broooo i swear shit gets real by episode 400 bro come on just watch it."" Since I am more accustomed to the traditional 12-episode format of anime by now, I simply lack the patience to allow One Piece or any other longer anime to get good. If a 12-episode anime cannot pull me in within the first few episodes (sometimes just the first episode), I usually will not watch it. Similarly, I try to allow these longer shows at least 20 or so episodes in order to demonstrate their potential. One Piece somewhat failed at that for me. While it was by no means terrible, I do not believe I would have gotten as ""far"" as I am in the series if it were not for me being forced to watch a set number of episodes as the result of losing a bet. The characters of One Piece are obviously supposed to be pretty good. I mean, you have 900+ episodes with these guys; if they're all annoying, how the hell are you supposed to get through the show? I don't think One Piece disappoints too bad here except with the backstories. The main cast all have clearly-defined personality traits that each add to the experience in their own way. However, some of their backstories are rather uninteresting. This is more of a nitpick. Comparing the backstories of Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp—which are somewhat generic—to those of Nami and Sanji is like comparing your grandpa's 1987 MS-DOS Packard Bell to a NASA supercomputer. [MINOR SPOILERS] Both of their backstories are just so much more emotional and impactful than being killed by Down D. Stairs. [SPOILERS END] Perhaps I am too early in the series to say yet, but some characters clearly seem to be getting preferential treatment as far as backstories go. Another nitpick I have is the voice acting. Even to this moment, I cannot quite place what bothers me about the voice acting; only that it seems to be more prevalent in the male characters. In the Japanese version, at least, everyone seems to be talking with the ""ueeghh"" dialect and voice. Luffy's voice also isn't very good. For female characters, it seems like they could be classified with either deep, Nami, or lady-like. Like I said, this is more of a nitpick. One Piece is by no means a bad show. I just do not like it as much as other people do. If I'm ""not at the good part yet,"" I am sorry, but I feel that I have given it a fair chance. 52 episodes is more than reasonable. I might come back to One Piece sometime in the future given that I stopped at what seems like a crucial moment to begin/continue another arc, but for the time being, I leave it with a sideways thumb.",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 29, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_3bd7e1d867,31,4937
"The story is just literal perfection. It might sound like I'm over exaggerating but if you have the time to watch all the 900+ episodes , its definitely worth it. There are so many iconic characters and so many mysteries yet to be solved, so it never really gets boring. It is an 9/10 till it reaches close to 90 but after that it is a 11/10. The pacing isn't the best but when u have time to watch, it is almost negligible and I never had issues with it. This show is definitely a 10 for Enjoyment as it has right amount of Comdey, Action, Adventure. Some may complain about the animation , and I agree that it is bad in some parts but Toei has improved and its recent episodes are really good (about from 630-right now).

"When I first started the anime i didn't had much expectations because I hadn't seen it anywhere except when I googled top anime of all time. So I decided to watch it. The first arcs of the story were slow and boring but enjoyable at the same time. The Marineford arc was very good. # CHARACTERS I found Luffy to be very energetic and seeking for adventure all the time without caring. Zoro is my favourite character. All members of straw hat crew are really exceptional from all the other pirate crews. All Yonkos are really powerful and interesting characters. I didn't find the marines to be interesting except Garp and the admirals. #STORY Story is very slow and intriguing. But I couldn't care much or less because this focuses more on new island adventures. The most enjoyable thing about this anime is it's world building . With every arc they go to new new island find new obscure creatures,characters,sceneries and this is the best thing which makes it so likeable. If you ask anyone who wants adventures like me ,this world will be on their top of the list if they get a chance to enter the world of anime.

"I dropped this show twice over the period of several years and the course of about 100 episodes because it started off so boring/slow and the art sucked. The third time I tried watching, I was completely hooked. I'll keep it vague, but all the random characters you think you'll never see again and don't matter are suddenly relevant later. That super subtle detail from 200 episodes back could suddenly be quite important or at least contain great symbolism. The arcs get better and better. The music is so hype, especially battle music. The power leveling and plot progression gets more and more complex, but in an elegant way where everything makes sense.

"When I started the early episodes one One Piece, honestly it was a bit of a chore (it took me 150 episodes to actually see the genius taking route in the series). The only reason I kept going was because of my curiosity- there had to be something that made this behemoth of a series so successful and enabled it to go on for so damn long! And there definitely is, it's just a matter of whether the payoff is worth the extremely large investment, and whether you're willing to dive into an ongoing 750+ episode anime packed with not entirely original content that's already been done before, seen before and displayed with much more visually impressive and compact Shounen series like My Hero Academia, Nanatsu no Taizai & Magi. Personally, I'd say yes it most definitely is, but not for the reasons you'd initially want or suspect. Despite being a battle Shounen, the fights in One Piece are somewhat lacking in creativity and excitement. Which is ironic, because the world of the series is outrageous; many of the abilities outlandish and downright bizarre- I mean the protagonist is literally made of rubber. But good lord, do not watch this series if you want insane fights and balls to the walls action because the anime does not bring it to the table...aside from maybe a few times. The animation plays a huge part in that though and honestly I'm torn on how to rate it- because sure, there are a lot of lazy parts & tons of still frames during fights, but the color palette is bold and the character designs are just zaney as hell. Most notably the antagonists who somehow manage to look equal parts ridiculous and intimidating; the charactarizaton is nothing to scoff at. So I'll cut One Piece a little slack- it has been airing continuously for nearly my entire life span! However menacing that statement seems, it also means that One Piece has over 800 named characters, all playing some role in their respective arcs. With such a large cast, it's impossible to not find hundreds of them endearing! The only problem being that they almost always never get enough spotlight because the plot of One Piece NEVER STOPS MOVING. Love that new character? Don't get too attached because you probably won't see them again for another 300 episodes! The main characters go from island to island to island to island, which makes sense because they're an infamous pirate crew with a thirst for adventure...but sometimes the story needs to just take a breather, and so do I. So many things are going on with so many different characters in different places, that One Piece has developed this terrible habit of jumping about frequently, simultaneously making me want to both slow down & speed up the damn thing. Confusing, I know! Despite this, with so many arcs, sub-plots and backstories, there's a lot of good content to sink your teeth into. After all, One Piece isn't afraid to step away from its main characters unlike many other series of the same genre, and that's something I can't help but admire. We delve into the pasts, plans and aspirations of many side characters, as well as the history of the world of the series itself and whilst it may not always be done to a T, it does a damn good job trying. Nobody is irrelevant in the story however small their role might seem. The true appeal of One Piece doesn't come from action or cool fights, but rather from affairs happening in the background or the possibility of exciting future events. Really, watching One Piece is like watching somebody building a mansion from start to finish. It starts with such a basic concept, but before you know it you're tangled up in this huge web that never stops spinning, and One Piece is definitely one big web. The characters are treated much the same way- simple, yet suddenly not. Now, One Piece is not an introspective series by any stretch of the imagination (just look at Luffy, the representative and heart of the story) but it is not one where characters are good or evil, black or white. Yes, some are more good than others and some innately more cruel...but most of the characters do good and do bad, and I think that makes them instantly more likable and relatable. The development of the characters might not be great, but the fact that they're greatly flawed makes up for that most (not all) of the time. The world-building however, is consistently impressive. With it's own intricate political system and flourishing world, it's not difficult to find One Piece's setting astounding, and the amount of creative genius that's poured into it's fictituous world is nothing short of admirable. One Piece isn't always great- some arcs flop, some go on too long, character gimmicks can be grating and half the main cast disappear for episodes on end, but when the series shines, it shines bright. And to me, a series is pretty damn magical when you can roll with its flaws and still love the hell out of it. One Piece is a journey of numerous ups and downs where you can't have the good without the bad; individual taste dictates whether it's worth the investment.",9,Recommended,"May 27, 2017",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_f97682f218,32,5063

"As someone that is reviewing one piece that actually is caught up with the anime I'll give a full in depth review of it... It's ok, first half before time skip has a few good arcs, after time skip most of the arcs are good. More specifically some of the best arcs in the first half I can think of are Impel down, Sambodey, and Marine Ford. The arc that is bad after time skip is just fishman island which wasn't even too bad tbh, but still way worse than all the other arcs after time skip. Most of the characters in one piece are very good near the end of where the anime is right now, because they have gone through tremendous character development and have strengthened their skills so much which is what I really appreciate when I watch an anime. At the beginning of one piece the jokes and animation can sometimes be outdated and the characters for me at the beginning where hard to get attached to. Another big problem with one piece is the obvious one which is the pacing. The pacing wasn't too much of an issue for me personally because I had a lot of free time that I could kill just watching this series for days straight (sometimes 100 episodes in one day), but for others this is a real and reasonable drawback to not watch this anime. The solution to this problem is to either use the sight one pace or to just read the manga. One piece in Wano has some of the most legendary animation and fight scenes and some of the character backstories and literally tear jerking and the show is just absolutely awesome lmao. Overall one piece is a great show or manga that I think everyone should at least try to get into and watch the first 400 episodes before it gets to be the best anime of all time (not really but it's up there), and I hope you enjoyed reading my scuffed review.",9,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d8afb9a509,32,1786

Story (10/10) The world of one piece is big hence the story pacing is slow but accurate for the story building, later in the episodes I realized how important were the backstories and how dots are connected.. overall story is very good... it sometimes I can connect to reality... Character (10/10) Every character plays an important part in the one piece world, with one character missing from the world can cause big change... the character development with every arc is worth watching of the people around luffy... and how he influences every characters..:) though every character gets a chance to shine.. Art (9/10) & Sound (10/10) Art is not much good before red line... but after red line it improved and now its. becomes a masterpiece (especially in Wano arc) Sound is good from the beginning from op, bgm or ending everything. is good and some becomes addictive Enjoyment (9/10) I enjoyed everything though pacing is really slow but after arlong arc I stated to liked it...and then after enies lobby arc I come to loved it...and there's no turning back... Overall (10/10) Patience is the key to enjoy this beautiful anime .... as in my case at first I was reluctant to watch the anime but now I have become a big fan of One Piece :)",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_365c77fdcc,32,1652
"One Piece. One of the most well-acclaimed pieces of Fiction in history, Topping the manga charts and becoming the longest-running shonen anime, apart of the Big 3, its hard to not have some curiosity why this series is so popular. During the beginning of the Covid-19 Pandemic, I began to watch One Piece, I realized its length, but something about pirates always interested me, so I decided to watch it over the span of 4-5 months, and let me tell you, when I am glad I did. Story 10/10- One Piece has an absolute stellar story. It is simple, Luffy wants to become King of the Pirates. Well, it isn't quite that simple Luffy is like a small fish in a huge sea (no pun intended). His goal is nothing short of near-impossible but that won't stop our favorite stretchy pirate MC from achieving this by any means possible. Luffy and his crew will not stop until they each have reached their goals and will find the mythical treasure left by Roger himself. The story is broken into individual arcs and while pacing may be an issue in some, it cannot simply takeaway from the greatness this story presents us. There is a quote from an anime that represents One Piece perfectly for me. ""You should enjoy the little detours to the fullest. Because that's where you'll find the things more important than what you want."" - Ging Freecs (HxH) This highlights that while attaining Luffy and our crew's goals, the adventure they are having is what is strengthening them as a character and as a human/reindeer hehe. Yes we want to find the One Piece, but many of us also do not want the story to end. Art 9/10- Many people will not watch One Piece due to its low quality from being animated in the late 90s. But the art style is something that makes One Piece stick out from its competitions much like JoJos. The animation is not the greatest at first, but it's simplicity/cartoonish vibe is something that paints our story so well and we have to give credit to Toei for making it so close to the manga in terms of Art. One Piece art is something that will grow on you, just like me and many other fans Sound 9/10- One Piece has a great soundtrack and great voice acting. The soundtrack fits perfectly whether that be a sad moment in the show (get your tissues ready... Not for Nami or Robin you pervert) but for the sad OSTs or the badass ""Overtaken"" when our boy Luffy is ready to kick some ass. Character 10/10- One Piece has the best cast of characters I have ever seen in anime. With such a heavy amount of characters, Oda make sure not one is forgotten. Each character added especially the straw hats serves a purpose for the story and will not be forgotten about down the line. The Straw Hats remain the best team in anime, simply due to the fact that each one is well-written and isn't just ""there"" they have their own ambitions and goals that compliment Luffy perfectly as well as themselves. One Piece has antagonists, who we as viewers, can usually empathize with and actually understand what their motives and goals are in a complex but also simplistic way. Enjoyment 10/10- One Piece is very enjoyable, it has a perfect amount of exposition and fighting, and you never once have the feeling of, this show isn't going anywhere. Some parts may be slower than others, but once you watch, you will realize how these slow moments developed our characters and the story in its entirety. One Piece you will enjoy all the way from East Blue to Wano Kuni. Overall 10/10",10,Recommended,"Jan 12, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_c3c83ae4e6,32,3460
"The anime have finally reached 1000 episodes but the plot is still pretty solid and even though it is still expanding, they are all connected. So let's move on, I agree that the animations was not that good but hey, I didn't watched this anime because of the animations. If you're not used to watching animes with old school animations, you might find it hard to start watching it. I bet it is much better if you'll get used to watching old school animes before watching the modern. As I said in the first part, the plot is masterpiece and it is super hard for any mangakas to pull that off since it is a pretty long anime. If you'll watch the anime carefully, you'll understand that the plot was not just something that came from nowhere, as if it felt like Oda actually thought about the whole story before even starting the manga. I've seen lots of theories about the plot of One Piece. It is actually commendable that most of those theories are wrong, since Oda made the plot as if it is almost unpredictable. You'll probably need to use lots of your brain cells just to predict one important scene in the story. I really like how Oda construct the plot. The more I watch the more mysteries will show up and more of those mysteries will be solved. There are lots of cliffhangers especially in this current wano arc. This anime won't run out of mysteries and you will definitely crave for answers. For the characters, I'll say that its been a long journey and they've grown stronger than before. I like the developments of each straw hat member, they've literally improved than the first time they were introduced. Their back stories are all interesting and some are still a mystery. I've already watched more animes but this anime was the most unforgettable for me. I easily forgot the name of the characters and the details in other animes but this one is clearly different. It is pretty long so it should be easy to forget but I think it is because we're talking about One Piece that's why. Please don't say that the anime was bad if you haven't watched all of it's currently existing episodes. Also, make sure that you're paying attention when you're watching it or else you won't understand most of it.",10,Recommended,"Nov 26, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_9c46411b69,32,2210
"you have all heard of the same praises so i wont talk about it but ill give you all the negatives. -the repesentaton of the woman and lgbtq community is not that good showing the gays as gross hairy men covered in hair and wairing dresses and woman all looking the same. although the author has been better with lgbt representation recently its still very far around ep 900. the woman have not gotten any improvment as everybody is fat and ugly or tits on a toothpick. the female characters dont get a lot of shine either dispite how strong they are. -the arcs in one piece are incredibly hit or miss which is sad. thriller bark was very slow and none of the fights were fun and there was nothing to add to the story and the main villian of the arc is pretty lame too. fishman island was hyped up and was pretty fun but its extremely forgettable for me, i cant remember any of the villian names in that arc and its sad that its the first episode after the time skip. skypia was a nice arc but the main problem was pacing as it was painfuly slow and if their powers were never explained as haki later on it would be a very bad arc in my opinion. im not going to talk about long ring ring long land just skip it. -timeskip battles seem to be alot dummed down and just summed up as whoeveres haki is stronger wins and that just how it is. pre time skip the fights were way more amusing making use of suuroundings and devil fruits abilities to the most potential. haki is not a very good powersytem but rewards us with very flashy fights and seems also mandatory to deal wit some opponents. i wish we could have a better power system and that pre time skip battles came back but we will never get that -the pacing is horrific downright torture and i dont blame people for not watching it. its also makes unlikeable arcs even worse and in my example punk hazard was not a very good arc and lasted way to many episodes. dressrosa was a great arc but 118 episodes was torture and was hard to watch. do yourself a favor and if your not fully invested at arlong park or alabasta you should drop it because then youll never like it and youll waste a lot if time -one piece is very repetitive and usually goes along the lines of 1)land on island and marvel in its wonder 2) find some dirty secrets and introduce the villans. step 2 also takes way to long 3) flashback to give the battles weight and add to the story 4) defeat the bad guys and liberate the land and then move to the next island",9,Recommended,"Apr 17, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_22de413d2c,32,2482
"I know many people complain about the lenght of the anime, but in my opinion that's part of the experience. One Piece is already a reeeeeally long anime (977 episodes up until today), adaptating the also reeeeeally long manga of the same name (1015 chapters up until today). It may seem as a really tedious anime to watch at the beggining, but once you start, it feels as though you can't quit watching it anymore, and that's not an issue whatsoever. Let's analyse it's traits: Story: 10/10 Eiichiro Oda has indeed the knowledge on how to build a story on which the world where it's set actually feels alive. The story arcs (not every story arc, but most of them) are meticulously made so the story as a whole has a meaning. For example, all of the arcs of the second half of the anime, even though they're set on completely different places and with different characters and objectives, they all are made for a final objective, which I won't say, but that final objective is a vital point for the realisation of every crew member's dream, which would be the final final objective. Apart from that, the world on which the story is set evolves with every arc, generating new obstacles for the Straw Hat's crew and even changing the whole story setting. It feels as every character shown has had, has or will have repercussion on the story, which is quite unusual among other animes. Art: 7/10 Let's see, Toei doesn't do a bad job, but it still isn't a great job. Let me explain myself. The anime's art is quite loyal to the manga's but... there's something that feels off sometimes. The animation has changed a lot these 20 years, but if you ask me, the animation is generally quite monotonous. The actual animation (Wano's arc's) is really cool imo. Sound: 7/10 Well, the openings are VERY good, the endings are OK but the sound effects are just... dull. They've been the same since 1999 and little changes have been made. But I'm saying this while getting critical, when I'm watching an episode, I don't pay attention at the dullness of the sound effects at all. Character: 10/10 As I said back at the story review, every character (with a name of course, not faceless background characters/marine soldiers) is unique and feels as if it has had, has or will have repercussion on the story. It doesn't matter if it is a character that has only appeared once in the whole anime, that character is most likely to appear and do something somewhere in the future. The Straw Hat's crew members are completely different from each other, each one with different dreams and personalities. And despite that, they all blend together well, making a really enjoyable cast. That's what makes One Piece's character development a model for other animes. Enjoyment: 10/10 I have to admit that there are parts more boring and tedious than other ones, but the enjoyment is still outstanding. In most of the episodes,(especially on the last 200), I have been thrilled to know what was going to happen on the next chapter by watching the next chapter's preview. Also, the story right now is reaching a really important climax and lots of things that were unknown in the past have been now revealed, making most of the fans (also me) really excited about how the story will continue until its end. Overall: 10/10 Despite the anime adaptation's mistakes, the story and everything else is the same as the manga's, which in my opinion, is a god tier work of art, so for me it's a blunt 10 out of 10. I'd reccomend reading the manga if the person I'm reccomending this to wants to read it in a hurry, but if that's not the case, I'd reccomend the anime if that person has enough patience and time. Personally, I've watched the anime instead of reading the manga because I think that experiencing One Piece in a longer, audiovisual format, makes me appreciate more a well done story, since I have the tendency of reading mangas in a hurry and not enjoying it as well as I should be enjoying it. From now on, the plot will be getting more and more interesting and I'm really excited on how it is going to develop. I hope you consider someday giving One Piece a try and see by yourselves what value does this anime have for you.",10,Recommended,"Jun 12, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8f10dde898,32,4200

"If someone asked me , ""is One Piece good?"" I would not be able to give them an answer. The time I've invested into this series is absurd. And if I were to say ""Yes , OP is good"" , it might be cope to not feel like I've wasted my life. But I find myself unable to say no because there were moments where I also felt , ""Hey , this might be the best show of all time."" Eiichiro Oda masterfully weaves mature themes like moral pluralism, corruption, anarchy, war, and slavery into the narrative, making them accessible even to VERY YOUNG audiences. Regardless whether they could be bullshit connections or not, the series boasts an unparalleled depth of worldbuilding and details hint at events and developments that may be hundreds of episodes in the future. Given the sheer volume of episodes , this level of intricacy should be expected. There is just one problem. Episodes have had frequent issues with pacing. This is not a problem when you've just started One Piece or are in the process of binging the show. When you catch up , thats when you begin the edging process. I caught up at episode 787 , where I had to begin painfully waiting for the Whole Cake Arc to air one episode at a time with little plot progression. I was 12. I had to wait 2 or 3 years for that to complete. Same thing for Wano. Waiting week after week for countless dragged out scenes. It constantly caused me to doubt the overall quality. Then every so often sprinkled in between, there are masterfully done moments which reignite that passion for One Piece, peaks of enjoyment that have never been touched by any other series I've watched, only to realise yet again that I'll need to wait a week for the next episode which might be the same shit they've been feeding me straight from a donkey's anus or it might be the nectar of the gods pouring out of Aphrodite's breasts. But the recent episodes have truly taken a step towards cinematic excellence, which has made the slower moments more enjoyable. Greater animation, so many details from previous worldbuilding coming into play, and the deeper plots slowly being unveiled. It somehow still feels like the show is reaching new heights step by step, and I can only pray this will continue.",8,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 20, 2023",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_173124975b,32,2217
"Unfortunately I have to give this show a bad rating. I´m reading the Manga since 2001 and still love it. The show unfortunately is not appealing at all. The animation looks so cheap, it´s really ugly. worse than that is teh pacing though. 5 minutes of reading is stretched into 2 episodes. It get´s tiresome quickly. On top of that I don´t like the changes they made to make it more kids friendly. i don´t want to spoil anything but I´m sure you have already seen the lists discussing the changes made in the show. I hope it will get a reboot like Hunter x Hunter, Fullmetal alchemist and Hellsing one day.

"For starters, I enjoyed the series. I do have my issues with it as well, that might be a ""RED-LINE"" for some. However, there is a lot of good this series does have. POSITIVES: - Good for passively watching while completing other tasks. - The world's lore is so expansive that you can get yourself lost in the endless theory videos. - It's light-hearted, fairly innocent (with exception of fan-service), has interesting fights. NEGATIVES: - The pacing of the show can make it feel like a slog if you're binging it. - The main characters, although they have their arcs, don't change all to much from when they're first introduced (aside from power levels). - Death SCENES feel inconsequential 99% of the time, and when a REAL death scene happens it's hard to be present for it because you just expect the character to cheat death, because reasons. - We don't need everyone's facial reaction to everything momentus that happens. - Some of the villains feel flat upon meeting them, and some are. But that bound to happen with so many villains. One inexcusable flat character is Smoker.. So much potential wasted. NEUTRALS: - There's a swap in power-systems around 250~ish episodes in, from Devil-Fruit to Haki. -- Devil Fruit Era: The fights are more based around coming up with interesting solutions to face the oppositions devil fruit powers. Or vice versa. You can't hurt Rubber Man with a Hammer, so use a sword. -- Haki Era: The fights are more based around the users level of Haki. Solutions that worked last arc now don't work, because your haki is too weak. With a Haki infused hammer, you can hurt the Rubber Man. Making devil fruit powers more of a neat quirk than a useful tool. However, this change can be seen for the better, as Rubber Powers started to feel a bit stale. The Gear system (for Luffy) to level up his Rubber-i-ness was really cool in the Enis Lobby arc. But the rest of the crew needed something to explain their power-ups, to keep up with power-creep. All in all, I'd recommend this anime as I would recommend the use of Audible. Do it alongside something else.

"This anime in a summary, is based. The charters are based with so many diverse personalities and abilities. The writer somehow manages to create this sort of worldly feeling whenever you watch or read the show. To the point where you feel like the story isn't focusing on our main crew, But the world as a whole. The amazing sound design brings the story to life with it's iconic sound track and sound effects. I started this show on a whim and 600 episodes later I am amazed by the pure scale of this show and how it never seems to get too stale. Almost everything that happens comes back in a later scene in a sense where it keep you on your toes in excitement. Some people find the art style ugly or unappealing but I don't think this show would be as fun and enjoyable to watch without it. I absolutely adore the devil fruit and eventually haki system and how well flourished it is to the point where even the haki sound effect is well recognized. The only real complaint I could make is the bad pacing in the anime, but the bad pacing almost makes it endearing and even more fun to watch.

"When I started watching, people told me ""it takes a while to like it,"" so I asked different people ""like how long?"" and they told me about 50, 70, or 100 episodes. When I got to 30, I was discouraged. At 60, I took a break and came back much later. I watched it little by little until I got to 175, when I gave up. Is it bad? No, but I'd say that, at least, the older episodes are a matter of taste. I no longer have the patience for the directing style and pacing of the time (remembering that it began being adapted in 1999), so maybe if I could get to the more recent ones, I would like it. But since I couldn't stand it, I didn't enjoy it. It's not MY taste. The stories didn't interest me, I didn't grow attached to any of the characters, nor did I care about their dilemmas, which made it difficult to care about what happened to them. ""Ah, but Oda is a genius at creating narrative,"" okay, but that's not enough to keep me watching when I can't even engage with what's presented to me.

"SPOILER FREE! This show is a multi generational masterpiece. One piece has so many fantastic elements and is an incredible show that many fans turn away from because of the PACING. I want to embark on why you should watch this show, even with that aspect, and how to get around the way the show drags its own feet (read my part on pacing). It is truly worth watching if you are a patient type of person, because it is one of the most incredible shows I have watched. It stands alone to the hundreds of anime I have seen, and will forever be in its own class. That’s how culturally impactful it is to animation. CHARACTERS : As someone who is caught up, one thing that I was constantly impressed by was the diversity of the characters and design. The world building in the series creates an environment for many interesting characters and out of world designs. Even with the so called occasional “villain of the week” characters, I never got bored. One thing I really love about one piece is the moral reality about the characters. Most shows don’t touch on the concepts of villain redemption, or that a character can change for the better. One piece thoroughly is aware of the motives of their characters. Some redeem themselves, some remain questionable, and some straight up aren’t redeemable. Some characters are just true jerks. But each character was written with thought, and it makes them feel like real people with real intentions. ANIMATION: This show is Toei Animations prodigy and love child. When I began watching it last year I quite literally saw the animation progress from the style of the 90s through the current times. That in itself was fascinating for me because you quite literally see the development of the eras of animation through the course of the show. BUT, please don’t turn away if you are thinking the older animation can’t stand to its today. Like I said, this is the studios lovechild. The animation at the beginning is fluid and even nostalgic in a way. It has its own charm. It’s still captivating and a lot of viewers even prefer the older animation. I initially turned away because I didn’t think I would enjoy watching outdated animation but I was wrong time and time again. And despite it all the show never loses its true essence, the soul of the series is always there. PACING : (the elephant in the room) One criticism of the show is that Toei takes arcs from the manga and drags them out SO long. And I’m not going to lie, they do. I almost dropped the show at points despite how good it is because it takes them episodes at points to do what the manga does in 2-3 pages. This was because at some point Toei was releasing on a weekly basis and longer run time meant more income, hence so much beating around the bush. Of course it still releases the same way, but this was a very important cash point before streaming services, and there used to not be a digital forum to complain about the pacing so they got away with it for a while. Believe it or not the show was airing decades before you could watch it on Crunchyroll. Despite this, the show is only 10% filler. Most of the time what they are stretching out is the canon. There is a way to get around this. A very dedicated team ended up creating a series called “One Pace”. They essentially fix this problem while delicately cutting out all the overstretching while not taking out anything plot wise. They basically fixed Toei’s pacing problem, since it’s so hard to watch the show otherwise. You can access this multiple ways if you have a watching device and it’s free. That at times was the only way I got through the bad pacing of the show. They dedicated and still are dedicating years to this and I would suggest any new watchers go that route. You can actually enjoy the show that way for what it’s meant to be without thinking, “get to the point!” The pacing in the more current years is better because viewers have a larger voice now that streaming is the main. Nobody wants to spend time watching them show the same thing for five episodes so Toei seems to have fixed this problem. It drags occasionally but it’s way more digestible than it used to be. Thank the internet! PLOT: The plot of the show is simple and that’s what makes the show so intriguing. What gives the show life is what the simple plot line allows to set up for, which is the incredible world building and interesting characters and dynamics. There are some arcs you may favor and may not. I would honestly say, if there is an arc in the show you are hating and you wish you could get past it to the next one, you could do it unscathed. I wasn’t crazy about the Thriller Bark or Fishman Island arc and I settled on watching a synopsis halfway through them because I was more interested in the next part of the story. Some arcs are weaker than others. But it’s up to each viewer’s opinion. Don’t let the bad arcs take away from the good. Arabasta, Water 7, Dressrosa, Sabody, Marineford, Whole Cake, and Wano are incredible. FILLER and LENGTH: Just skip the filler. It mostly takes away from the show and I found them to be some of the worst arcs in the series. This is occasionally not the case but if you’re pressed for time please don’t worry about the filler. There is SO MUCH show and so much time in the average day. Take that for what you will. The length of the show is more than a mouthful (or eyeful?) The show is REALLY long. Even so I think it’s worth the watch guaranteed you are smart about getting past that pacing. If you are the type of person that has nothing to watch because you’ve already seen the majority of the shows out there this will keep you from being viewer hungry for a while. It took me 6-7 months to get caught up from the beginning, but I didn’t feel resentful for having to watch so much. It’s a great time killer and the show is refreshing and easy to follow so you can pick it up and put it down without getting bogged down by all the plot you may have forgotten. If you have time, watch this show. It is a true Classic and had many cultural influences on the anime industry. It is a fun and even thrilling watch a lot of the time, and most viewers wonder why they waited so long. It took me years to pick it up because of how dauntingly long it is, but once I did I regretted not picking it up sooner!",10,Recommended,"May 6, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6ef428e0fe,32,6315
"No matter how good the first episodes are - DON'T WATCH IT. The first 500 episodes are good, a handful of them are great, but unfortunately, the quality of this show went south afterward. First, the show’s story progression became even slower than it was because of the manga. As a result, every episode now includes the full opening played at the beginning and then a 2-3 minutes recap of the last episodes. Not only that, but most of the “new” episodes have an insufficient amount of actual plot progression and more annoying fillers and flashbacks of what we have seen only one or two episodes ago as if we were too stupid to understand and connect the dots without the flashbacks. Second, the art became dull. I’m not an expert, but the newer episodes feel cheap. Everything from the world to the characters is less detailed and the colors are boring. Besides that, I don’t like what they have done with the female character’s breasts - They’re too big to my taste and compared to their size before they changed the art style. The characters are boring, cheesy cliches. The new characters are all the same, they have nothing meaningful to add besides bad written and over-sentimental lines that (supposedly) should lead to some cheesy flashbacks that make the main character say something cringy about the heart of the cards... oh oops, wrong show. Anyway, maybe if the episodes were released more often than they do, then it could be more emotional, but even then these scenes are rather uncomfortably cheesy/awkward to watch. You might assume that 500 decent episodes are a good reason to at least start it, but what is the point of starting something that you most likely won’t even finish? Even if it’s not a good enough reason for you, and you believe you might like the new episodes, consider this: It took them about 2 years to complete each of the two most recent arcs (Dressora and Cake Island), and the current arc is far from being the last one. Now, considering that only few new people will pick one piece, and old fans are leaving the Fanclub, there are only three possible outcomes: Either you will have to spend the next 10 years waiting for the final episode, or the anime’s budget will become even smaller and the quality will get worse, or show will get canceled. Even if you consider the journey more important than the destination, this journey has all the chances to become bad and longer than your love for anime.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_aa3dd29624,32,2440
"Best thing I ever watch/read/seen in my life. And trust me I've seen a lot from Indian cinema to Hollywood, but there's nothing as legendary as One Piece. It is the most special thing in my life. Obviously, the manga is on a whole new level, but the anime adaptation of the greatest comic book of all time does justice to the manga. Only one reason is enough to say that the anime does justice to the manga and it is the Japanese voice cast. They give life to the characters. Art: Oda's art, duh. But the animation gets a little mediocre after time skip but that shouldn't worry you if you're a One Piece. 9/10 Story: The greatest story mankind has ever come up with. 10/10 Sound: Good choice and one of the most iconic Shonen music + the voice cast. 10/10 Character: Every character is close to my heart, every One Piece fan at this situation should be biased, cause they are the greatest fictional characters. 10/10 Enjoyment: The greatest form of entertainment a living creature can ever witness.

"I once Loved One Piece, It used to be great... YEARS ago and I'll play Morpheus here before I start the review. If you want to stay in the illusion that One Piece is the best of greatest animes of all times, let it go, dont read my review. If you wanna know why the series is saturated already, keep reading at your own risk, you have been warned: 1- No ONE. EVER. DIES. - It doesn't matter what is happening, if it is a bullet, cannon ball, knife, sword, atomic bomb, war, no one in the series ever dies, Oda only gives you the illusion that the character died to show moments later that everyone is ok. 2- Flashback Kills - This one is contraditory to my first argument, but to dont say that oda never kills, he'll enjoy doing that in flashbacks, in the actual arc be relaxed, no one will die, but in flashbacks? be sure that someone will die. 3- ""Hey, Ace and White Beard Died"" - Yes my Friend, and he made an entire arc for that to happen and who else died without being in a flashback, entire wars and civil wars happened, where EVERYONE got just bruises and scars... 4- Civil Wars : EVERY ISLAND, EVERY SINGLE INSLAND, they face a civil war, one way or another, the population of the island fight, it doesnt matter the reason, they'll just fight. 5- Random Mystery to be solved: Oda tends to throw mysteries around the series, just to solve them 100 chapters later, but it is not like lost, he doesnt give you hints about it, he just throw the mystery, and throw what it means, simple as that, but if you wanna know, keep watching for the next 2 years. 6- Moar Boobs: By the past years, the female boobs is just increasing, while his creativity is diminishing. He is basically throwing random fan-service to keep audience. 7- Hidden Royal Familly Seeking Something: Somehow the Crew will reach an island, and if that island have a monarchy, be sure that the king is overthrown and they will meet the princess and the king in coincidencial circunstances. 8- Secret Organizations: I lost the count how many shady characters and secret organizations appeared, they are always the all powerfull, just to appear another one more all powerfull than before. 9- Epic Moments: At the end of each arc, Oda tends to do something unexpected, and THAT where is his MASTER TRAP is, every arc, usually ends with luffy or someone from the crew doing something amazing or really unexpected, remember when I said about Ace and White Beard Death? That is Shocking, happened at the end of the arc, Goind Merry Being Burned? End of The Arc, Luffy Burning the Marine Flag? hum... And now that the trap is laid, the audience wants to see more, so he dont need to be deep, so shallow plots and characters are just enough, as long as he can keep giving them what they want. And that's basically his formulae, and it works pretty well, he doesn't change it, people like repetition, Fairy Tail is also a ""success"" so... if you give people simple fights with Power Ups never seen before, boobs floating, Epic Moments at the end, Rinse and repeat, success, One piece is doing that with maestry in his last years, Fairy Tail do that since the beggining, and Naruto do that Since the end of the Genin Tournament.

"Plot (10/10) There is no animated work of fiction that has performed a greater worldbuilding than One Piece. Cultures, civilizations, power relations, it's a world with an impressive wealth of details. And even more impressive is how the author, Eiichiro Oda, was able to conduct such a long and detailed script with practically no plot holes. A striking feature is how the author often manages to use information that had been left at the beginning of the story, hundreds of chapters later, no information is wasted at all. Main character (10/10) Luffy is a character based on Goku, from Dragon Ball, and just like him, he has a pure heart and is always helping others, is always hungry, and when he eats, he eats a lot, doesn't have a great intellect, but is a genius in combat. He's a character who can seem irrational and empty-headed to the first-time viewer (and he often is, after all, that's the fun) but Luffy is a deeper and more well-developed character than he seems, and that development only increases with each passing arc. He has great emotional intelligence, a very strong sense of justice and morals, in addition to being able to recognize the strong from the weak, the allies from the enemies, with very little information, just by analyzing the personality. Luffy is a brave, dreamy, determined and loyal character, capable of anything to defend his friends and achieve his goals. He is also a character who goes through an intense process of personal maturation, making him rethink some of his ideals. Side characters (10/10) One Piece has a huge variety of characters, many of them are purposely funny-looking, some even seeming like caricatures, but there are also beautiful and stylish ones. Few anime know how to present a character as well as One Piece, often the break in expectation between presentation and reality generates humor. During the journey, Luffy recruits new ""nakamas"" (crewmates), each of them has unique and important skills, that will be needed at some point. They all have dramatic pasts that shaped who they are, and I'm sure you'll be thrilled with each one of them. Luffy's Nakama are as important, iconic and beloved as he is Art (10/10) Art is an essential part of One Piece. There are several islands and even countries, with different climates, cities and cultures. Not to mention the character design, which is extremely creative, and the diverse creatures and monsters that inhabit this rich world. Animation (4/10) In an anime with more than 1000 episodes, the animation quality will not remain constant like in a season anime with 12 or 13 episodes. However, this never bothered, until the Wano arc, where the animation style changed drastically, the anime became more colorful, with many special effects (like Dragon Ball Super). In this arc, the episodes that give the most audience receive animation worthy of a movie, these are the ones that have fights or important revelations, while the others received a power point animation. And in this arc the problem was not only in the animation, but in the direction as well, the inability to put the right soundtrack at the right time, or to manage to adapt an important scene correctly. Wano's arc wasn't well-adapted, so I can't give the animation a good rating. Despite having good animations in some episodes, this is not the reality for most of them. Soundtrack (10/10) One of the best, if not the best soundtrack I've ever seen in animes.",9,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8f3c875fec,33,3449
"One Piece as a whole is a wonderful beautifully crafted story with amazing build up enhanced by its phenomenal worldbuilding and characters. Those factors make for extremely entertaining but also thought provoking lore. With all of that in mind the anime has many glaring issues that prevent it from being a perfect 10/10. The most potent of them all is the bad and even sometimes unbearable pacing which is made worse by the weak production that was evident through a solid portion of the show, this can drastically lower the viewers opinion on the show and so they would miss out on the good it offers. Extra notes: The voice acting is done wonderfully The story is good at hitting every emotional point Great symbolism *I personally believe that the positives greatly outweigh the negatives so you should give it a watch",8,Recommended,"May 1, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_39c86607b5,33,823
"It was almost 3 years ago that I decided it was time to start the grates adventure ever told. Let me tell you it wasn't an easy start. Going into One Piece when I started there were less then 900 episodes but not far off. I told myself Ill give it 10 episodes and if I don't like it after that I will stop. Ill be honest the first time watching it I stopped after episode 1. I could not fathom why this show about a kid made of rubber who cant swim had almost 900 episodes worth of entertaining content. So I gave up and walked away. Then the pandemic hit and I sat down and said well if I am ever going to watch it all then now was the time...I had literally nothing but time so I forced myself past 10 episodes and I found myself asking questions about who and why things were happening and by episode 26 I was hooked. I know I really like something if I cry and that was the first of many moments in this show that have made my cry. It took me 6 months before I officially caught up with the show and ill tell you it was worth every second. I have never laughed so hard or cried so hard at an anime before this. 900 episodes just wasn't enough I was begging for more after 6 months of only One Piece. The Characters are Lovable and grow so much over time, not one detail in this show is unnecessary everything and I mean EVERYTHING is important. Oda the writer is amazing and I can only praise him in his work! The world feels alive when you watch this show, you know that things outside of the main story are affecting what is coming or what will happen in time. I have watched a lot of anime before this and I have watched alot of anime after this but I always come back to this show and am in AWE of everything about it. If your considering watching One Piece please do! I haven't met a single person who has watched it and given it a fair chance and hated it. You need to meet the main crew and get to around episode 20 before you decide if its for you or not. I can say nothing bad about this show other then sometimes fights get dragged out but that I have to say is typical of any Shonen in my opinion so I think overall its a 10/10 for me!",10,Recommended,"Dec 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_8b6b0da291,33,2150
"I think that's a great anime, but it can't be compared to the manga, that is far more enjoyable and fun. Also, the anime is pretty slow in some arcs, like in Dressrosa or in Whole Cake, the quality of the anime fell a lot after the timeskip. Besides that, in almost every arc we have some great moments that is something really unique about One Piece, and keep you excited to keep watching the anime, i cant think in any arc of the anime that haven't a single very emotional moment that can make you cry or something, and makes you want to continue watching. Also, seems that the anime is getting better with the new arc of Wano, both in animation and in rythm. I know that the arc in the manga is definitely one of the greatest, so i can't wait to see it.

The story is amazing, what other show can make such an incredible story that can go over 1000+ episodes? Exactly, none.

The animation quality of other shows like naruto, boruto, hxh cannot even begin to comprehend the idea of having animation as good as one piece. The characters in the story have amazing development throughout the show, going from weak to powerful whilst along the journey seeing them develop gradually.

"This review DOES NOT contain SPOILERS. It took me 8 months and 21 days to finally catch up to One Piece (I took one long break along the way). For those of you who are wondering whether you should give One Piece a try, I encourage you to go do it. Why? Because One Piece changed my life. From stories, to characters, to sound, to art, One Piece has managed to catch my attention. Are there no boring parts? Oh, there are draggy parts. Are there no frustrating parts? Oh, there were, and some of them felt as if they would never end. But in the end, the journey was all worth it. It only took like two or three episodes for me to like One Piece. Then some few episodes later, I realized that I was in love with it. Ever since One Piece, no other anime ever caught my heart again. I was addicted to it, and I have not gotten addicted to anything else after it. I have to say that Oda is brilliant. For me, the first 300eps or so of One Piece were 100% perfect. After that, it went kind of downhill for me. After that, there were good and bad moments. But I stuck to it, and I don't regret it at all! Don't be afraid of starting One Piece. Yes, it's almost 1000 eps now. But I say, just enjoy the ride. Don't rush through it. Enjoy every moment. Savor the stories. Fall in love with the characters. Appreciate Oda's brain. Thank you for reading, and have fun in the world of One Piece! You will be surprised at how deep and exciting a story about Pirates could be. The story will blow your mind. The characters will capture your heart and you won't ever want to let them go. The songs will make you feel nostalgic. One Piece is 100% worth it. Trust me.

"One Piece holds a very strange position among anime. As one of the longest-running television series of all time with over a thousand episodes and at least five more years to go as of this review, it's garnered a following as one the THE must-watch series among otakus and weebs. It's art direction is stylish and often bizarre, and the overarching story features a massive cast of very well-developed characters. Too bad it takes a million years to watch. I dropped the series not because it's bad quality, but because I knew how much time it would take up and how many filler episodes there are. I can't help but wonder what the original author's mindset was when he began writing the manga. Surely he wasn't planning on letting it drag on for this long, was he? I can't give this series an objective score because I couldn't even get a tenth of the way through because far too much time is spent on villains monologuing after displaying their power or the Straw Hats needing to stop by an island to solve a local problem. I admire Toho Animation's dedication to making sure every arc is covered properly instead of skipping key plot points like Fire Force apparently did, but it's evident that this is only an extremely hardcore series for hardcore, dedicated fans. But is it good? How else has it gone on for so long???? I recommend this if you're willing to miss out on new releases for the next several seasons or potentially destroy your social life (do any of us weebs really have one?

"The most complete work of all time — that's the way to describe One Piece. The anime has its slopes because of the winding and because of toei animation. But reviewing the anime, I saw that it doesn't matter close to how good the work can offer the person who is going to watch it. Luffy from the moment of his journey is already captivating, development of each character in the bunch makes us already get used to them, cry and be happy with them. In addition to having an impeccable development, we see the preparation of the direction in the middle of the work. The sadness scenes are very good and very well developed. I cry more in the anime than in the manga. The adventure is the most closed point of the series, because we want to see more and more. The use of soundtracks, direction is very good even with the lack of animation and time drag made to extend the time of the episode. Complete work, humor, development, story, and even more, script impeccable. The work increasingly demonstrates that everything was planned by the events that occur, and it becomes increasingly impossible to let go. There's no way to stop liking this work, because we are already so connected to the absurd development, that we forget even the mistakes and ramblings in the episodes. Oda's work on the characters and arcs is amazing, and each arc there are 1000 messages spoken. Racism, power control, friendship, happiness. All together in something just to emphasize us with the work more and more. Many also say about the art of One Piece. It's done in a funny way, and in the last few chapters we got the answer as to why. One Piece is a work to be funny, but it manages to be one of the most serious too, the author manages to put any emotion into the series, so if you don't want to watch One Piece because of the animation, you don't know what you're missing. In the case of this anime, the animation doesn't matter so much, if it has an impeccable direction lurking in it. Winding yes, it is one of the great criticisms of this work, to give screen time and when they adapt only 1 chapter of the manga, the anime becomes unbearable to watch at times. With fights that stare at the characters' faces for minutes and to occupy screen time and also not get too close to the manga, we see from afar, a problem in anime, but with so much good stuff, it goes unnoticed in the analysis, that's why my note will be the same. Deaths, one of the most debatable subjects, why don't any characters die? Well, this is a big problem for One Piece, as it takes the impact of possible deaths off the series. When a character can die in the work, we don't believe it, because we always see everything work out in the end. Of course, the scenes of sadness and impact, even without deaths, can make anyone cry or be in agony, due to the great development of One Piece, and that's why I believe, that so well the characters are introduced, Oda doesn't want to kill them, only when he already raises them to die. One of the best stories of all time, without a doubt, this series, brings everything good in a very well written. I say — thank you! Because this wonder exists.

"One piece, the most popular out of the long running shows. And this show is extremely long. One piece is really good. Only downside in the show is pacing but it’s not terrible just extremely mediocre. It doesn’t make the show dreadful to watch just very boring. The manga is definitely better but both are enjoyable. The animation at the beginning isn’t the best but it has a certain charm to it that later on you kind of miss it. I feel like the animes biggest strength is the time you spend with the characters. The manga is just the story, while the anime has little character moments. For example, the straw hats on the Sunny/Going Merry, Zoro and Sanji arguing, etc. It just makes the straw hats feel more like real people. I feel like most people’s goal starting one piece is to finish it, but then around Punk Hazard and Dresssrosa (maybe this is just me) I didn’t want to finish it anymore. I just wanted it to last forever. One piece from the first episode is great but somehow it grows on you more over the course of the series.

I've lost interest in everything other than his anime. the story is soo detailed and the forecasting is mind-blowing, the evolution of the art is phenomenal. the character development is amazing in many ways and portrays maturity throughout the anime. all of the characters have fitting voices and the sound effects are on point. this anime has helped me through thick and thin keeping me happy and keeping me hooked. watch one piece and you'll beg for nothing but more. if I could I would erase my memory of watching one piece and would rewatch the whole thing. the movies are also very good, the art is immaculate with all the destruction to the work of the devil fruits powers. the sounds are amazing and the non-canon story is mind-blowing.",10,Recommended,"Aug 31, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e31962a431,33,829
"One Piece follows the story of Monkey D Luffy, a boy who dreams to be king of the pirates and his crew, the straw hats. This anime is an absolute masterpiece of the Shonen genre. The incredible mix of comedy and plot, the wacky characters, the unique art style, all of this makes for an absolute magical experience while watching One Piece. Many believe that this series is going to be bad just because of the length and trust me I was there myself at some point however, I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this series really is. One Piece is so fast paced and exciting. By ""fast paced"" I mean there is a small amount of filler and it is just arc after arc after arc.

I mean, I like One Piece but after Ennis Lobby Arc, I am no longer excited, I just watch it whenever I have time, 20 eps in one sitting. but ONE PIECE is good but overrated. just saying about the theme song, Boystyle opening is the best, livelier than others. but to me, still its a masterpiece.

"One piece has the best world building out of all the anime I have watched. I gave it an 9 because it is outstanding in many categories, the bad thing about One Piece is deaths, Oda just makes some wack death scenes, makes an emotional death scene and BIG REVEAL, they are still alive. The animation in the Wano arc is insane. Since one piece has so much episodes and chapters, it also has so much details for many characters. This gives One Piece watchers/readers a lot to talk about and predict. Each ark has its ups and downs. The Art and sound were not the best early on because it is a 20 year old anime, but It didn't stop One Piece from being one of the best.

"Genuinely a great anime, good for Veteran anime-watchers to newbies to anime, the story line (in my experience) was amazing, i am currently on the skypiea arc and cannot express my enjoyment of this series' growth in depth. The way everything lines up is astounding, not to mention the character development seen from Zoro and Nami, genuinely a great anime from the beginning, can't wait to continue and sometime get to the Wano-Kuni arc!! But there is an issue with the way the Captain, Luffy, wins fights. His power levels are a bit inconsistent, and is always fluctuating up and down, now don't get me wrong, it makes fighting scenes way more enjoyable, but i just cannot get it out of my head.

"Easily the GOAT shonen anime. Over 20 years of story and NONE of it feels contrived. That buildup has resulted in easily the most worldbuilding, character writing and adventure in any piece of media I know of. The world of one piece is just SO ALIVE. Every little islands the strawhats come across has their own histories and inhabitants with their own little backstories. Seriously, there are seemingly thousands of different characters, probably a dozen of which are interesting enough to be their own protagonist in their own story. And like I said, none of it feels contrived. It all develops naturally, nothing ever feels forced at all. The writing is done masterfully such that each new adventure comes up organically. It genuinely feels as though every single plot point had been cautiously mapped out since the beginning. For such a long running story of such a grand scale, there are very few and minor inconsistencies in the story. One piece introduces some dude in chapter 200, basically disappears, then that dude is the most important character in his own 100 chapter arc starting at chapter 500?! Sounds crazy, but it works! It works because it fits into the greater story seamlessly, just like all arcs, and the character was interesting and memorable, just like all major characters. These are just some of the reasons why one piece has remained great for over a thousand chapters, and why I continue to be so invested after all these years.",10,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fed0950c93,34,1457

Dont get me wrong, rhe show isnt bad. but it has been pretty meh from the beginning. so far ive reached the skypea arc which has been so hard to continue watching. im probably not going to stop here coz i plan to at least reach the marine ford arc before i reach a good verdict on the series. the problem i have with it is that ive tried loving it from the beginning but so far its not really worth the hype. its an ok series at best. Zorro is probably the best part of the show and he carries it for me. luffy isn't a very good protagonist and he can sometimes be annoying, the comedy in this show falls flat on its face and only serves to make the show more annoying, ussop is like the worst character in the show and chopper is an ok character. i really cant get into the show with such a boring main cast. anyway, if anyone had a similar opinion and the changed it later on please let me know when one piece got good for you coz i really want to get into this show",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 25, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_bcbddce3e6,34,1098
I love One Piece. It is my favorite anime But i would not recommend it to all because it is long but it is worth it if you like the story. If you like it you will see the changes over anime over the last 25 years from the East blue to Egghead. If you are planning to watch it I would start sooner than later because if you just go online you will see tons of spoilers. Some arks are slow like Dressarosa but if you do not like the pacing I would recommend reading the manga. Reading the manga would be faster if you can read the chapters in under 20 minutes too. But if you are willing to skip or just want to cech up fast but also want to see all the cool animation i would recommend either reading up to Marineford than watch the anime up to dressrosa than skip the first half of dressrosa to the Doffy fight than watch the anime to the current episode. You could just skip the filler and the intro and outros too.,10,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 26, 2024",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_780b4bb9a8,34,916
"Yes, it is a long series, but if the series was bad, it wouldn't have continued and been as successful as it is today. Although the premise is fairly simple, its' characters, world building, and dynamics/perspectives between the good and bad make this an enjoyable and absolutely worthwhile show. Long shows like this are never perfect, but with the constant flow of great content, it brushes away all the bad.

"One thing that you have to understand about One Piece is that whether you want to watch it or not, thinking it might not be for you is that that's valid. The excuse that it's too long is dogshit. But One Piece is the best written fiction ever. No other medium manages to create such a rich world with such and amazing story and characters with just one medium. Not even Tolkien. No other fiction that I have consumed (which is a lot) can even compare to One Piece. Other series can have great world building as well but nothing else does it so perfectly and contained within ONE MEDIUM. Not 10 books, 50 comics and 4 films. Oda does it with one continuous manga and there has yet to be anyone that have been even close to overcoming him. It's the story of a lifetime and Oda is one of if not the greatest fiction writer ever.",10,Recommended,"Aug 18, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_52825a01b1,34,825
"So what looks like a fun & goofy pirate adventure with friends actually holds so many deeper & darker tones then what you'd might imagine.. A few of those themes are: Racism, Slavery, Corrupt Govenrment, Family & Freedom.. So let's just get into it!! The characters: The characters of the story are golden worth. Some are more interesting then others obviously but to have such a HUGE cast of characters. HUNDREDS OF HUNDRES of characters and i remember so many of them.. Their face, backstory, actions and moments that was spent with them.. Characters that have only showed up in one arc will leave enough of an impression on you to last through out the whole story.. Even 1000 chapters/ episodes later. The villains of the story are also usually REALLY great.. Some of them are written in such a way that when they're shown on screen you just need to pay attention, they're such a scary presence that it just sucks you in.. The World: If amazing characters were not enough then let me tell you about the world. It's so dense and deep that it blows my mind how Oda can even keep up.. I won't go into too much detail but the world never sleeps.. Other stories and anime that have an ""expansive"" world.. Usually end up very flat.. That's not the case with one piece at all. Once our characters leave an island to move on with their adventure, that place doesn't just freeze in time or disappear out of existence. The world always seems so connected.. It's so hard to explain :( The Fights: With it being a Shounen, there's A LOT of fighting.. But what you'd usually hear about One Piece is that ""the fighting isn't what it's about"", which is true.. But that doesn't mean the fights are not interesting. They're insanely interesting and some of the more interesting in all of Shounen.. So in this universe we have these powers that are called ""Devil Fruits"". Which is just a cursed fruit that once you eat it, you'll gain an ability but lose your ability to swim.. Now what you'll gain is almost randomized, but you'll be in 1 of 3 catagories. Zoan, Logia & Paramicia. Zoan, these powers will revolve around animals and creatures. So transforming into a hawk for example.. There's usually 3 stages to these transformations, Normal form (your base form), Hybrid form (Mix of your base and creature), Pure form (The full transformation).. Zoans also have a special type grade called Mythical.. This means you're not limited to Animals and Creatures.. But Mythical beings aswell, one example being a Golden Buddah.. Logia, these powers will turn the user into an element.. Now that's not just ""Water, Earth, Fire & Air"".. Nonono.. There's Light, Darkness, Ice, lightning, Smoke, Sand etc. Any material or element you can think of, there's a power for it. Now it doesn't just mean you have to actively think about using the power. Let's say you get shot in the head, but the bullet will just pass through you and Paramicia, now this.. This is where Oda can really cook.. Paramicia fruits are basically ""Whatever the fuck else"".. Whatever oda can come up with that doesn't fit creatures or elements.. For example Luffys power! Being made of rubber! It turned his bones, hair, skin, organs & everything into rubber. With that comes the benefit of being bullet proof, can't get take damage with blunt objects, can't die from falling & obviously streching his body at will.. There's also powers like: The Chop-Chop Fruit, you can split your body at will and float around with your body parts & you're immune to being cut as you'll just split instead.. There's endless possibilities with these type of powers. So with all of these different powers, fights in the story are never boring. It becomes a game of figuring out what your opponent is able to do and how to counter it / play around it. Imagine a JoJo fight but actually interesting as the characters are actually good lol. Now any story is not without its flaws.. And one piece is not a flawless story.. Well.. I should say flawless anime.. As the anime is on a weekly production, that means they can't cover 3-4 chapters per 24 minute episode like any seasonal anime would.. They have to cover 1 single manga chapter per episode.. Which is usually around 15 pages long. That is clearly not enough material to cover in 24 full minutes so the pacing of the story really struggles a lot. Toei (the anime company) have to stretch out the story to almost ridiculous lengths to keep the production going every week without stopping, now if we compare it to Naruto which was also a weekly produced anime.. Naruto did the smart thing of doing filler arcs. Where we pause the conflict at hand and the actual story to just produce random bullshit episodes that don't mean anything in the actual story. Let's say we're gearing up for a war, but oops! Time for filler! Now we'er gonna spend 3 episodes oncovering a mystery about birds!!.. That type of filler you know? One piece sadly doesn't have that so what they opt to do instead is strech the episodes out so it matches the episode run time.. So they'll add in useless reaction shots, dragged out conversations with extremely long pauses and so much more.. That's the only flaw with the one piece anime in my opinion.. But trust me, when you can binge watch over 1000 episodes, this will not be an issue, as you can just keep the story going and move on to the next episode. Honestly, missing this story is just a shame. So go on, set out to sea and find the one piece.",8,Recommended,"Dec 25, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_eb70db7041,34,5460

"For me, it's a great anime, but of course, like all animes, it has several flaws and stuff that I do not really like. The first thing I do not like: It's very entangled, they only need 3 things, it takes 30 to 40 episodes for them to complete. The second thing I do not like much: A long time ago I began to realize that the anime / manga began to be ""infantilized"", if I may say so, as before the animation was coarser, nowadays the animation is lighter. Now let's talk about the things I love about the play. First: Oda has a lot of creativity to create characters, I would never be able to create a single character on my own (of course he does not do it all by himself, but anyway, right?), So much so that I will be inspired by Oda's work to create the game I'm developing. Second: If he says that something is super rare, then this thing really will be super rare, example: a zoan myth.",8,Recommended,"Sep 10, 2018",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_a3b8336a27,34,892

"People underrate the show One Piece even though it has a great storyline. Every arc in the show is great while the storyline will keep you wanting to watch more, or even get hyped for as you meet new characters. The entire storyline of One Piece has tons of unsolved information. Even at this current time, lots of stuff has still to be answered. There's information about the sea. Like why is it so dangerous? What are the connections between the sea beast kings? The monsters that rule the sea. Also, what are their connections between certain people? There’s also information about the past. Like what happened in the void century. A time that nobody remembers but a few. even information about the powers in the show. Like where do they come from how many are there.

Happy satisfying moments, funny scenes, emotional deaths, epic storyline that makes you want to bingewatch it and how it shows the pain and suffering of this beautiful yet cruel world. I would say, the starting episodes are main character introductions so, dont judge the show by just watching 16-17 episodes. I myself found this anime interesting after watching episode 24. The main excitement of the show begins when the crew gets into the grand line. That's when everyone gets hooked to the show. Currently, airing arcs WCI arc and Wano arc have splendid animation and One Piece has shown some awesome fights recently. I'm not biased so I'd say the anime has pacing issues after episode 600, so you can shift to the manga which is top tier itself.

"I started this series expecting it to be a conquest. I wanted to be able to say that I had watched this ridiculously long anime. Little did I know that this show would change my life. What starts off as a fun and goofy adventure with a weird-looking art style-- yet dripping in 90s and early 2000s nostalgia-- quickly becomes one of the most heartfelt and cleverly written narratives that I had the pleasure of experiencing over the course of many years. It may be over 1000 episodes, but the series is still aiming at the unanswered questions that it posed on day one. Every arc delivers with a familiar formula, yet I am still regularly shocked by the amazing twists and turns that this story takes, which are often built on forshadowing that can be traced back many years. Eiichiro Oda never fails to deliver with a story that is cohesive and fully utilizes the well-developed characters and world that he has taken time to lovingly build. I have recently realized that the goal of the story that was clearly set out in the beginning feels entirely achievable and realistic after 1000+ episodes, and that this feeling was built up gradually without taking any shortcuts. Every arc gets the characters and the world one step closer to what will be the grand finale of grand finales. This show has moments that will bring you to tears, cover you in goosebumps, freeze in shock, and a soundtrack that perfectly enhances all of these moments. The ""weird"" artstyle delivers characters that look larger than life, yet are entirely believable and unforgettable. If you are looking for adventure and love, do not let 1000+ episodes intimidate you. You just need to start at the beginning-- as we all did-- with a desire to get whisked away into an exciting and emotional journey. And if you do get whisked away, just know that the adventure of a lifetime is a guarantee.",10,Recommended,"May 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0fbed526cb,34,1865

"As a shounen anime it has really fun arcs that are worth your time, my personal favorite parts being Skypeia, Thriller Bark, and Impel Down. The story also has lots of inspiring characters. Luffy is accepting of everyone and simple minded-ly only cares about protecting his friends. Nami may use unfair means to try get money, but she truly has a good heart and deeply cares about others. The OPs and EDs are amazing and I love the crazy character designs for even the side characters. The show may be long, but I believe its worth people's time to learn about all the amazing islands and new crew additions as the story goes along. My only problem is the animation getting lazy in recent episodes causing repeated animation and slow pacing ruining the show. As the show can be repetitive, feel free to skip certain arcs of the show if the theme doesn't interest you to save time.",7,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0d412c77a8,34,880
"Story: 9/10 Can get formulaic but makes up for that with new content in almost every arc. --------------------------------- Art: 5/10 This is where the anime falls flat compared to the manga. Up until the Wano arc, the art direction was nearly completely different from the manga. The show also suffers from animation issues. --------------------------------- Sound: 7/10 Some of the tracks are good and memorable. But like most anime, its not the shows main focus. --------------------------------- Character: 10/10 The characters are really fun. Could recommend the series for them alone. --------------------------------- Enjoyment: 9/10 You should have fun while watching this series. The characters are fun and you should enjoy the battles despite them lacking in animation. --------------------------------- Synopsis: 8/10 Decent series, but I'd say you read the manga over watching the anime. Not until very recently (Wano arc), the art in the show was pretty unfaithful to the very well-drawn manga. In general, the anime was very faithful to the manga, but the art, pacing issues, and typically bad animation get in the way of the experience. I've watched 69 episodes so far (nice lol), but for now I'm probably gonna stick to the manga when I get a chance to buy another volume.

"If I didn't love this series i wouldn't have given it such a high rating now i will proceed with my explanation. Keep in mind i won't be talking about one piece itself but more about the anime adaption. Toei did a fine job with sound, animation, characters. The problem is pacing and to keep it short it's trash. To extend episodes Toei shifts between characters and adds extra scenes that weren't in the manga but were heavily implied. The second part isn't so bad but the first part. I'd prefer if Toei just delayed episodes like Mappa did with AOT season 4 so we can have an adaption more focused on manga content and better pacing. At the end of the day it's an adaption not a replica but god it's a terrible adaptation Toei just wants money at this point though i'll admit the wano animation is beautiful but also a bit sloppy at times. I give it a 7 because I love one piece and i think anime is more entertaining than manga seeing all the fights, the emotion, the sound etc.",7,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_15b41214d0,35,981
"One piece é um anime Shounen com uma história e um mundo fantástico, e eu quero simplesmente julgar a nota, os pontos positivos e negativos de cada arco dessa obra gigantesca(East Blue até Whole Cake pois Wano ainda não terminou): East Blue: este arco se divide em 3 sagas principais, sendo elas: Romance Down, Orange town e Arlong Park; Romance down: a saga em si é chata e possuí um lento desenvolvimento, mas possuí um bom foco na comédia, o estilo shounen é bem escasso nessa saga, portanto, não espere uma boa porradaria; Orange town: essa saga é um tanto mais movimentada que Romance down, sendo bem apresentada de maneira divertida e rápida; por fim, Arlong park é com certeza a melhor saga e o foco do East Blue, afinal, é nessa saga que temos os primeiros conflitos realmente dramáticos e importantes de One piece, e também, é nesta saga que One Piece começa a pegar as características de um Shounen, tendo um bom antagonista(Arlong) e coadjuvantes medianos.

" i really like this show, i have been watching anime for years now and pretty much watched all the popular/good ones. the characters and their history, the reason why some characters say/do things have a reason and not just comedic reliefs. one thing I hate about this show is that some of the fights are straight up goofy and not worth watching for ex the arlong fight was unnecessarily long so i skiped it. and the drum kingdom fight too. i haven't completed it (106) but i like the build up and the story more than the subsequent action to finish it off. i am not saying all of the fights are bad just some of them are unnecessarily long. otherwise good anime",9,Recommended,"May 13, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_1492119667,35,662

It's one of the longest ongoing anime there has ever been, and on top of that it's a whole continuous story connected from the very beginning, all woven beautifully into a story that grows with you.

"5. Continuing from my Naruto, DBZ, Digimon and Pokemon reviews, I am still documenting my anime journey. While we all were addicted to DBZ, One Piece was airing before it everyday. It was still a small show about pirates. It was light hearted and adventurous. We watched it because there was literally nothing better on TV and to be honest we quite enjoyed it. It was funnier than DBZ and Naruto. Its fights were down to ground back then and quite simple. While we were tired of Naruto fillers and awaiting more combat and DBZ was slowing down despite being so slow already, One Piece was taking off. The fights became more fierce, the arcs were diverse and interesting. The emotional stuff was destroying our hearts much more than Naruto's did. It was a great story and we were hooked. Every episode was fun, even if it was a filler it was integrated in the arc and we truly could not distinguish a filler episode from an actual manga original one. They had humor and sadness equaling real episodes! Not just throw away fillers to fill some time like Naruto or DBZ. The East Blue introduction arc was slow but steady, it knew where it was going and took the distractions on the journey. Using them to flesh out the characters. Ging Freecss from HunterXHunter said something like that it is better to enjoy the little distractions on the adventure. The Arabasta and Sky Island arcs took it up a notch and were amazing stories with great battles. Dvorak's New World symphony playing during the final battle blew my mind. They truly made it epic! And then it happened, the battles evolved. Gear Second, Gear Third. Water Seven and Enies Lobby arc changed the whole game. The protagonists got upgrades and the battles evolved to rival if not even succeed those of Naruto and DBZ! While Naruto Shippuuden was slowly abandoning the superb tactical shinobi combat for more DBZ ""ima throwing my laser"" type of combat. One Piece was not falling in that pitfall. Every episode, every arc is just such a blast! Watching on TV was not enough, I rewatched the entirety on the internet in Eng sub. Got further in the story because TV dub is just too slow. Manga was even more amazing! Eiichiro Oda is an amazing artist! In fact there are only 2 manga artists I truly revere and that is Oda and Kentaro Miura (Berserk). The time of DBZ was over, the new generation needed a new king. The successors were the Jump's big 3: One Piece, Naruto and Bleach. Bleach fell of quickly and Naruto stumbled but ended. One Piece is the true king of Shounen and successor of DBZ. A couple more years and One Piece (1997) will outsell even Superman (1938), Batman (1939) and Spiderman (1962) in comic sales! Truly a king of kings. The show has shaped my life greatly and I still carry many of its lessons. Don't get me wrong, the show is not perfect, but what is? I had a new standard now, if shows were even a quarter as good as One Piece, I would recognize and give them a chance. A chance I gave to the highly promising Bleach, a choice I would regret further down the line..",10,Recommended,"Aug 11, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_931fb374b5,35,3049
"I started watching this series to see what the fuss was all about. I like the premis of the story, the art and the characters (no developements though), but the pacing is awful. Most of the times I skip 5-8 minutes at the beginning of an episodes until the story slowly progresses. I didn't mind that much when there was a good story arc, I just felt sightly annoyed. But now I reached an arc, which is not that engaging to me, so the slow pacing really takes away a lot of the overall enjoyment. It might have been really good, if they had paused once in a while to break it into several seasons à 25 complete episodes.

"To be honest my score should not be taken too seriously because most of the 10s are what I give for the manga. Overall the anime is great, but it really is way bad compare to the manga. The story, if regardless most movies, no doubt will be 10/10. The way how it took off my personality mask and touched me is great indeed, when Usopp Pirates disbanded, when Hiluluk laughed about his coming death, when Saul told Robin nobody is born to be lonely, when Coby stopped Sakazuki and trying to protect the rest of the marine soldiers, when Kyros was holding Scarlett's body and crying for his helplessness, when Corazon put Law in that treasure box and guarded him until his last moment, when Senor Pink traded his dignity in exchange of Russian's smile, when minks guarded Raizo with all of their lives with a honor, when Pudding made her choice with Sanji, probably the man who would love her more than any other man in the world, and the man she may never seen again... I do not know who would stonefacing these scenes. The art... I have to say almost all good looking characters are looking the same, but from little bit this, and a little bit of that, we could effortlessly tell who they are. The sound track, I did not continously watching it except major fight and some episodes because the pace is just so sluggish that I felt it is torturing me. But I do found Luffy Moukou and The Very, Very, Very Strongest being my favorite. Characters are quite spread in the story, so I guess it kinda equal to it I would say I enjoyed the series... Man I just hate writing too much words... Overall it is my favorite show along with Jojo, Seven deadly sins, Yugiohs, dumb funny animes, and other animes that I am too lazy to provide names... Only reason that the anime receives a 6 is because its sluggish pace...... by the time Luffy had his first fight with Kaido, he probably already became the pirate king in the manga......

"One Piece is unmatched in its world building and character development. including side characters, not just the main cast. Every side character, new arc, and new area is so compelling and drives you on Luffy's journey, keeping you engaged throughout its numerous episodes. Furthermore, not to be deceived by the cartoony and unique animation, One Piece touches on many tough subjects and social points of today's actual world. This ranges from wealth, social classes, racism, and more. Overall, One Piece is a very real anime.

"Easily one of the best shounen ever !! One might say i am exaggerating. Great story , good pacing. The way the story progresses is actually great for me too. The soundtrack and OST especially during the battles or when some truth or suspense is revealed is superb ngl. The fact that Luffy's dumb personality at times tends to annoy us and the amount of times he gets lucky could be overlooked for me. Its a burden but a slight one. The character development is done in a proper way as a result of their struggles ,losses, escape by insane amount of sheer luck. The world building of One Piece also deserves a mention in a hugely positive way. It mostly kept me wondering what will happen next and forth after most episodes.

"I am currently at about the halfway point of the series and I am here to tell you if it’s worth all of the effort to watch this series. In short: Yes, if you’re willing to commit to it. The story starts off a bit slow and begins to pick up over time. The one problem I have is the amount of irrelevant fillers that make an appearance in episodes. I don't mind a gap between arcs because you can always skip those episodes. In recent episodes, I have had a problem with filler dialogue that doesn't really contribute to the overall story at all. Like there could be a whole episode that has half of the time dedicated to minor characters and it disrupts the flow the story. Another thing, some of the arcs feel like they are dragged on forever. It just doesn't reach a conclusion in a reasonable fashion, which is irritating. However, the longevity of the series can also be a positive in developing the plot. Luffy and his crew run into a lot of interesting people which allows them to make connections that later can become relevant to the plot. For now, I have to give this series a 7/10. I don't plan on dropping this series anytime soon but if you're debating on starting this series or not, be aware that there are a lot of bumps along the road.",7,Recommended,"Aug 23, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_099f78a2bd,35,1250

"Just finished the Marineford arc and suppose that I should make a review on what I've watched so far. The plot actually is quite good, even though carrying the mainstream shounen anime and a little bit straight-forward. As you watch the anime, you can easily tell that every episode is intriguing ( I don't know if you want to count fillers ). Also, every arc I watched so far does not disappointed me at all, even though some maybe better than the others. And it is also have originality, maybe because its concept that is rare in shounen anime. Just because it left a complexity, I'll rate the story 8. The art is not so compelling as the story is at the beginning, but as you follow every episode, the art is beginning to improve. Although not as good as the other newer animes, the art is good enough for at least myself. I'll rate the art 7. The soundtracks, OP and ED are really good and well placed, suitable with the story that is about the pirates and adventures. Guess I'll say nothing more about the sound and rate it 8. The character development of every Straw Hat crew is quite good, considering the adventure that they had experienced. It's impressive how the adventure had make them more mature and stronger in terms of physical, mental, emotion and their will. I'll rate it 8. The anime is really, really, really enjoyable. The anime can make you laugh, being amazed and cry at the same time. So, I'll rate the enjoyment 10. Overall, this anime is one of the best anime that I've watched so far. Why not the best? Because there are some anime that is same level as One Piece. BTW, I'd recommend this for those who loves shounen anime. So, say no more, I'll rate this anime an outstanding 10. P/S : And for those who says that this anime sucks, open your hearts please. One Piece isn't as bad as you think. Don't be so judgmental just because the art is not so compelling, the episodes are too many or whatever that makes it looks bad to you.

"While i would without a doubt give manga 10 out of 10, anime just doesn't deserve such generosity. You know that something is wrong, then your anime looks much, MUCH better during episode 300 than during ~700. I guess Toei realised that they don't need to pump any money into this, kids will still watch it- so we have a miserably bad animation (ironically, the best animated scenes are these where characters are just talking, any movement, especially backgrounds, looks embarassing at best) and annoying reuse of sound effects... You laughed at CLANG from berserk? One Piece STILL uses Dragon Ball Z sound effects! Bad animation alone wouldn't be much of a problem, if the story was good, right? And it is- if you look at the entire arc. Single episodes are boring as f*** unless you skip through them. Every episodes starts at time of 6:00 and ends at 22:00. Subtract 20s of eyecatcher, another minute of camera slowly moving through ugly backgrounds and another one minute of reused scenes from previous episides and you end up with each episode lasting maybe 14-15 minutes. And even this is stretched as much as Toei can, with dozens of characters reacting to every mc actions and filler fights. Most episodes cover a single, 18-pages long chapter. Even other long-running series, like Bleach or Naruto, used to cover at least 2 chapters. But i said ""MOST"", because there are some that cover... less. Imagine entire episode based on, let's say 10 pages, that you could read under 8 minutes. Stretched to a full episode! That's a regular OP episode. Watching one piece without skipping is painfull, but hopefully there are still some fairly good episodes, every now and then (i somehow watched through entire Law's past without skipping a second). Also, the material anime is adapting is outstandingly good, even if this hideous cartoon would suggest otherwise. Something went really, really wrong with this anime. I mean, it used to be better- not only the animation peaked during Ennies Lobby/Summit War, but also anime used to cover at least 1 chapter per episodes (and sometimes- it's actually enough). But nowadays watching one piece is just exhausting- for example, Dressrosa Arc lasted for 100 chapters in the manga... and 120 in the anime! Whole cake- 80 v 100! I simply can't imagine the torture of watching it weekly, in front of tv, for full 30 minutes. I'd forgot what all was about before Dressrosa could end... But there's a simple explanation to it all- the manga counterpart. Obviously, Eichiro Oda is a god of mangamaking, and each volumes sells in millions. Also One Piece airs on sunday morning, next to a freaking dragon ball and other kid's favourite shows. Of course millions will watch it ANYWAYS, so Toei doesn't have to spend more than, i guess, ""enough"". They do not have to compete with other series. And Toei knows it- they know that if they aired more than 4 episodes of filler in a row, less would watch it (and sadly, some filler were pretty fun). That's why they decided to move at such a slow pace, because even showing one minute of new content is enough to attract millions of people in front of TV... But hopefully animation slightly increased in recent episodes. But OP anime is still a shadow of its former self.",7,Recommended,"Feb 8, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_4ae531309e,35,3254
"Right now, at 2:40 in the morning for me, I have decided to write a review for quite possibly my favorite anime of all time. However, I have decided to write it for people who might be off put by the length of One Piece. One Piece, first and foremost, is an anime/manga that follows the story of 1 of many pirates, Luffy, whose dream is to become the Pirate King. Pretty standard shounen stuff right? At first glance, you might be inclined to just skip past this, not only due to it's length, but to it's seemingly generic plot. Generic Shounen Guy wants something, and he's probably going to get it because he's Generic Shounen Guy. That however, isn't the point behind One Piece at all.This anime/manga mainly details the JOURNEY to becoming the Pirate King. One Piece isn't about Luffy's dream to becoming Pirate King, it is about the journey he takes to get there. Story: One Piece has one of the greatest story's I have personally ever read, and a large part of that has to do with the completely unique story One Piece portrays. Yea, you could say that One Piece has elements from other things, but doesn't everything? The story is just grand (outside fillers, which surprisingly, aren't even that awful. And Skypia. I think I'm the only one that doesn't like skypia though) and when things happen, even to characters that you know won't be around during a majority of the adventure, you tend to feel for them. Art: Unlike most older animes, One Piece's art style has honestly aged well, and only gotten better. Nuff Said. Sound: The OST for One Piece is honestly One of the best Piece's of music I've ever listened too. (get it?) The openings are fantastic, and so are the endings. Characters: The characters in One Piece are extremely unique, and are pretty much all memorable, if not by name, but by what they looked like or what they said. Some characters just had a certain way of speaking, others looked extremely funny, and some were just memorable in general. Enjoyment: Some animes that are much shorter than One Piece have often gone on the backburner when I get in the mood for One Piece, mainly because if I'm in that mood, I can't really scratch my anime itch unless I watch some One Piece. Overall: Definitely the best anime I've ever seen, and I challenge anyone to give me one better.",10,Recommended,"Mar 6, 2014",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_e6d8be011f,35,2306
"There are a large amount of reviews for One Piece, so I expect this one to be swallowed by the rest, but I simply have an urge to talk about this show, but simply utilizing one paragraph would not be enough to captivate even a percentage of the genius that this show provides. One Piece stands above its genre: One Piece is not just a good show. While this may be a cliche sounding line, I seriously believe this to hold much more weight than just ""it's a good shounen"". One Piece swept many kids off their feet and showed them a world like no other- where your imagination could be free. For many this was a large part of their childhood, the manga, the anime, the theories, forums, Youtube... This show took many people's lives and ransomed it for all it was worth. One Piece is a show I'd trade some of the best shows in shounen for its existence. Mystery, romance, slice of life, comedy,psychological, action.. This show doesn't just fit into one genre, and it never leans too much into one way of writing. Many shows nowadays are boiled down. Oh this show is X, and it is good because Y. One Piece takes X and Y and then says ""let's add the whole alphabet"". Some might say they like One Piece for its action, others might say they remember it for its sad moments, others might analyse the master craftsmanship of Oda and his ability to make the world breathe with foreshadowing, preplanning, backshadowing, backstories, and its overall design philosophy. This show doesn't just stand as a battle action manga, it stands as a reminder that a show can be art. Arcs: You can take a single arc from One Piece and it could stand as its own story - with themes, ideas, teachings unfolding into what I perceive as just a peek into Oda's mind. Each arc feels widely different, but still upholds everything that came before it, making a widely different story tie into the grand narrative that is One Piece. From ninjas and samurais, to giants and dwarfs, to merman and sea creatures, to animal people, and sky islands. The show never stands still, never feels like it's held back by some imposed restriction, and because of that, while the show is creeping up towards 1000 episodes now, people still crave more. Characters: Characters in One Piece are by far the best part. Jujutsu Kaisen goes to show that animation and action cannot save poor characters. With lacking depth and actual character, with hardly any backstories or reason to care about the characters on screen, you're often left rooting for characters based on how cool their power is. One Piece says ""screw that"" and fleshes out even minor characters, with practically any character that is involved in the story having some level of a backstory or explanation for why they exist. Usually these backstories are really well written as well, with even the dumbest looking characters leaving you in tears over how harsh and or inspirational their backstory is. Or they'll have a backstory that will make you hate them even more than you did. These details may not be fleshed out straight away, with a lot of the start of One Piece having quite one-dimensional villains and forgettable moments, but Oda goes back on even some of the more mundane characters and fleshes them out later on, again, tying very small percentages of the show, arcs, moments that pale in comparison to its size, and puts them in the limelight just enough that even the smallest of moments have a place in the grand narrative that is One Piece. The main backstories and good writing around the start of One Piece, and what will even propel you to go as far as the grandline is the main cast. The start of One Piece may feel long, with 60 odd episodes of fleshing out the main cast, giving them a present story, a backstory, and a reason to join Luffy's crew. This is by far the most important part of the show though, as everything that follows it relies on this first major arc as the backbone to for which the show resides on. Even this early back, with very short arcs, you still get to see the genius of Oda in how he designs his stories. Each island has a theme, each side or main character on that island has a story or a tie in some way or another, and each island teaches the viewer a new lesson, and with each lesson the cast develop, growing stronger both physically and mentally, gaining new resolve and upholding previous resolves that they then carry on their shoulder throughout the rest of the show. We deal with loss, control, terror, slavery, hunger, power, lying, betrayal, beliefs, dreams, hopes... All within the start of the show. Presenting the world in both its darkest and greatest moments, showing the depth of each character and what drives them forward, or what brings them down. When you make a villain the reader cares about, you know you've written a good story. Even past the large wall that is the grandline, or past the dangers of the calm belt, characters all over the sea, moments passed, memories at this point, still live and breathe and react to the news, bounties and stories that are passed down from Luffy's adventure. While a mild touch, this goes to show that everything matters in One Piece. You aren't experiencing a linear path of a hero defeating villains, you are experiencing a interconnected woven web of hundreds of characters and their point of view. Characters that are long gone still manage to retain importance, either by being brought back, mentioned, or even being set as the crux of a new situation that resides 100s of episodes away. This style of writing works both ways, with characters being mentioned, foretold, only to wait 300-500 episodes for them to even show up. A symbol isn't just a symbol, a sword is not just a sword, info is not just throwaway, all of these drops in the ocean ripple out towards the future and the past. This world is living and breathing outside of the main cast. Luffy despite being the MC isn't selfish enough like most shounen MCs to hold the flame as he marches forward. While his shines the brightest, everyones holding a match or a lantern, and sometimes they even start bonfires, forest fires. This shared importance to writing characters is what makes One Piece characters some of, if not the best characters in all of anime. World: The world of One Piece is large, and every part of it is intentional. Each island, landmark, ocean designed exists for a reason. The all blue, red line, grand line, new world, calm belt, 4 seas... Each major idea proposed allows for your imagination to go wild, and enough of it is left open to interpretation, or shrouded in mystery. Why is it designed this way? How did these things naturally form? Were they created? This is just the layout of the world, but it goes deeper. The will of the ""D"", Celestial Dragons, World Government, Gold Roger, the forgotten history, poneglyphs, Revolutionary Army, The King, Cipher Pol, 7 Warlords, 4 Emperors, and the most important mystery and plot device in the whole show: the One Piece. Who, what, where, why, when... I swear the English language needs more W's, as the level of depth that shoots passed the introduced narrative of ""an action pirate adventure"" is mind boggling. Theories, hourly long videos, ""who would win?""... This has spawned more content than the actual show provides. From Youtube, to Reddit, you have an endless sea of conversation. The day this show ends won't be the end as people reread, rewatch, find new clues, background characters, signs, foreshadowing, backshadowing, anything that they can get their hands on. This show will be dissected from the toes up and be used as an example of how to write fantasy. This show isn't just a cartoon, anime, it is fantasy on the levels of 'Game of Thrones' and 'The Lord of the Rings'... Because of its comic/manga book presentation, and it being a cartoon, the show may never have been on such a historical level as those books, but those who have dedicated themselves to this series know deep down if people were more open to One Piece this could be a global phenomenon of hype. Sound/Music: While an anime exclusive, I can't help but talk about this music/sound in this show. VAs in Japan do a much better job overall than a lot of the world due to its strict requirements in Japan's media business. So it is a no brainer that the VAs for One Piece are good, but some of the performances here are amazing. I never once think to myself that a voice doesn't match a character, or a voice is unsettling/off. Yet I do get brought out of the moment at some of the lines and delivery of characters like Nami, Luffy, Hiriluk - this only being a few early characters, because of how heartfelt and impactful the delivery is. Alongside these moments is the music. While One Piece repeats a lot of soundtracks, the music is what truely makes you feel something, and once you get familiar with some of the common pieces of music in One Piece, as soon as the first few notes play, you either know something epic is going to happen or you're going to be balling your eyes out in the next few minutes. I love anime that makes me feel something beyond my body's ability to hold itself together - but One Piece has done that so many times I lost count. I've cried over inanimate objects in this show for Petes sake. Then the moments where cool shit starts happening... I cried tears of joy, had my body shake with excitement, and verbally yell in my room by myself ""LET'S GOOOOO!"". This show is pure joy, and I can see myself down the track past its airing state rewatching scenes 100s of times... Hell, I already do that. Art/Animation/Pacing: Sadly, with most things, it isn't perfect. Now before I get hate, I want to say, this is anime exclusive. Oda is a great artist, while these characters seem odd at first juxtaposed to most generic anime art styles, the art in the show is expressive, allowing for odd and unique character designs, something a lot of shows struggle to create. The art is timeless, and Luffy being made of rubber was the perfect design for extremely over the top perspectives and insanely creative moments. As a former artist myself, I wouldn't even dare to challenge Oda and his creativity, and attention to detail. His ability to create perspective, depth, animation within still pictures is immensely respectable, and he doesn't get enough appreciation for this. Despite this, the anime lacks in a lot of places. With scenes of sloppily stitched together frames, to a ton of freeze frame moments or cuts that make you feel like something happened, but realistically nothing was animated. The colours and art is inconsistent, something you'd expect from a show of this size, but still disappointing nonetheless. There is love in here, moments that are crazily animated, great art, but it dips up and down constantly leaving a lot to be desired. Wano (current One Piece arc) is great in this dimension, but even Wano has times where things feel oddly still/unsatisfying due to the shows poor pacing passed Thriller Bark, leaving more than half the show to a crawl in pacing. A show that could of been adapted within 333-334 episodes in total if done at 3 chapters (usual anime adaption amount) an episode by the time it reached 1000 chapters, but instead we have nearly 1000 episodes matching 1000 chapters. If this show had the treatment of HxH, Jujutsu Kaisen, One Punch Man, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, it would be undisputed as the objectively best long running show among most anime fans. I hope in the future it gets this treatment, but as of its current presentation, it's bearable, and still loveable outside of the manga, but binging it is the only way to really enjoy your time here, as watching weekly or even just a few episodes at a time will hurt around post time skip arcs. While I still love it, I have stopped watching numerous times waiting for it to get somewhere before I bother catching up again. Despite this, some of the best moments are in the anime because of the music, voice acting, and animation creating an experience that isn't possible in the manga, but as an overall experience it is often dampened by its flaws, and pales compared to the quality of the manga. Conclusion: I could talk all day about One Piece - writing until I've created my own book about it - but I wouldn't want to waste your time, or my time. One Piece is outstanding. Oda's writing, the worldbuilding, the characters, the culmination and strive for perfection. You can feel Oda's soul through his work, and I'll carry this journey through the rest of my life. One Piece is a passion for me. Which sounds odd given it's just entertainment, but I truly care about this show. I will die on the hill that this show is more than just a show, it's art - and as logically contradictory as that sounds, it is the only way I can express the meaning this show carries for me, and everyone who loves it. I hear all the time jokes about its length, people claiming it is too long to get into, that no show is worth the time investment. Alas, I started rewatching One Piece again, this time with a friend, experiencing it all over again. If my experience isn't enough to get you into One Piece, surely you must hate art (haha).

"Where do I begin…? XD I put off this anime for a LONG time, but I seriously regret that now, partially because I now have to catch up -.- but also because… well…I can’t really fault this series at all! XD This is my first review so I’ll try cover everything I can think of! And this review will be 100% spoiler free (I’m prone to spoilers myself…) NOTE: I watch the FUNimation dub. Story: If your looking for an anime with a solid plotline your watching the wrong anime. The main point of the series is finding the treasure left by the infamous pirate Gol D. Rogers, the One Piece. However where I am at the moment this has been interrupted by a side mission to help someone, and I’m guessing this is how the story will continue. (Note: I know NONE of the story past where I am now, I don’t read the manga or watch the sub) Despite the randomness of story it’s still brilliant and extremely entertaining, which, let’s face it, is the main point of a story. As for the pirate aspect of the story…I have no interest in pirates (another reason why I put it off), but to be honest Luffy’s crew is not your average pirate crew…to say the least XD Art: Okay, so THIS is what put me off the series for so long, and looking back at that now I feel slightly embarrassed…I really love the art now! It’s different, unique I guess you might say, which is exactly why I liked anime such as Soul Eater. When I was deciding on whether to watch One Piece or not, I kept coming across forums and people saying “Don’t worry the art improves after a while.” I’ve seen a bit of the “improved” art and to be honest I think I prefer the old one, but that’s just a personal preference I guess. Anyway, anyone reading this DO NOT do what I did and not watch the series because of the art, because you will regret it! XD Characters: What can I say? Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of this show is the characters. Where I am in the series, there are 6 members in the crew, each one as different as the next. This variety of characters is one of the strongest points of the series. There is BOUND to be someone in the crew that you will love. As for the main protagonist, he’s just as idiotic and loveable as so many other main shounen characters. In fact, he’s probably more idiotic and loveable than all of them combined! You only have to say the name Monkey D. Luffy and I’ll start laughing! To be honest, this show is worth watching just for Luffy…well, him and Zoro maybe ^^” Sound: I’ve loved all the opening and ending songs so far, and I particularly love how FUNimation dubs them using voice actors (Vic Mignogna singing the first opening definitely helped me to keep watching, not that I really needed any help…) As for the music in the show, I don’t notice it that often, but when I do, it’s very fitting and works well with whatever is happening at the time. Off the top of my head I can think of one example of a song that plays at sad moments and really helps set the mood, it’s a beautiful piece of music. Enjoyment: This anime is perhaps one of THE best anime in relation to enjoyment. I haven’t found myself being bored once. The other day I found myself watching an episode and when I was finished I realised nothing had happened in it…and I was still so entertained by it! It didn’t fail at one moment to keep my attention. The fights are also brilliant and don’t tend to drag too much (in fact they may be a little short XD) To be honest, there are few other shows that have made me laugh as much as One Piece. Overall, this anime is a MUST SEE! And what’s brilliant about it is despite it being a mainstream, long running shounen, it has practically no fillers! (And even when it does I find it really hard to differentiate between them and the canon story) Sure, the story drags at points but that’s to be expected from an anime like this, and unlike other series, I don’t notice the drag as much. It’s just too entertaining for that! XD I would give this series a 9 but looking over my review the only flaw I can find is it drags a little…however I’m not sure about giving it a 10 because of this…so I guess I’ll have to give it a score of 9.5!",9,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2011",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6aac89a9b4,35,4150
"What should I say about this Anime? Now I'm not one for long running Anime's, always drawn into things like FullMetal Alchemist and Code Geass... but what surprised be about One Piece was the CHARACTERISATION. You follow the story of a young green-horn pirate called Monkey D. Luffy on his journey to find the One Piece. Leaving his home town on a journey to become Pirate King. Along the way he meets friends who he takes upon his crew where there the story only just begins as trial and error becomes apparent in their every turn. This forms the crew called the Straw Hat Pirates. If that short snippit doesn't seem like much, let me explain. If you're full on personalities of characters, Eiichiro Oda has provided that in One Piece with a DON. No matter what character you meet, even if you hate them or love them, have a backstory so unique to them that you can't ever shake it off. It attaches to you. If something happens to a character, it's never forgotten, if there's a bonding between two characters it instantly becomes apparent through each episode you watch and never breaks. You will find yourself having feelings for characters you would believe to be side fluff, but instead you have those tissues out ready to blow your nose. You're not just journeying with the Straw Hat pirates, you're EXPERIENCING and LEARNING with them, you're almost taken on board with what's happening which makes the experience so gratifying. The negatives is it's a hard series to get into, and I fully suggest if you start watching One Piece, or beginning the Manga, that you STICK WITH IT. If you want to see the juiciness of what this creation is all about this Anime does need a lot of your time and efforts to push through to the engaging episodes. When you reach engaging episodes, sometimes there will be some areas where they drag it on way too long and you find yourself frowning at the screen because the same fight has been happening for 5-10 episodes. This IS COMMON EARLY ON, however it becomes less and less in the later series. Filler, even though it's few and very far between, is awful. There is a mini series episodes tucked which is dedicated to a few spin off titles of One Piece that are not so bad but the filler... is just filler. There's nothing special about it, although it's understandable why filler happens. When I started One Piece I had a lot of free time on my hands, it almost became a daily watch for me since I had the time after my studies during University which is why I got so far in such a short time. However, don't let not having any time deceive you from watching this Anime if you are interested because I promise it gets awesome. Real awesome. I can't stop watching it any way.

"Has great story and world building but it gets lost especially early on with the pacing. It felt like a chore to watch the first couple hundred episodes, I held on and kept on watching since i heard from so many that it gets really good later on and its worth it to deal with the pacing issues. Some of the episodes and arcs had an unbelievable amount of wasted time or filler for example the same flashback was shown 48 times in one arc. While it does get good later on i would not recommend anyone to stick it through and watch all the episodes I would recommend to watch a summary video on youtube of the first couple hundred episodes or watch arc summary videos for the first few arcs and then start watching from there. Overall it's a good show with a great story, world, and characters that everyone should watch but i currently can't give it a higher score since i can't just ignore the issues that affect a large portion of the show and make it just unenjoyable to watch some episodes and even arcs. I might raise the score up to a 6 or even a 7 depending on how it ends and the pacing of the coming episodes.",5,Recommended,"Feb 16, 2025",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_fe53cd539d,35,1117
One Piece is one of the most well known anime/manga and is one of the longest running show ever. It revolves around the Straw-hat Pirates lead by Captain Monkey who strives to become the Pirate King. He is the possession of the Gum Gum Fruit which allows him to stretch his body like rubber. The arcs are very good and enjoyable and slowly show the character development. The Straw-hats are bunch of very enjoyable and rowdy characters which are very easy to like. Each member has their own goals and unique abilities which help the plot in many ways. The show is way too long... but it is a must watch. You will understand the show's amazing story and mysteries only if you have watched the show. The anime shows how the Straw-Hats development from being weak pirates to one of the most wanted pirates in the One Piece world. The manga has now proceeded to the best arc of One Piece and I strongly suggest to pick up this legendary series.,10,Recommended,"Apr 7, 2019",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_b5c4d90ee1,36,940
"You pull up to One Piece thinking it's about some stretchy guy who wants to find some lame ass treasure, but in reality you enter the most fucking amazing god piece of writing world. this show is legit better than any shounen, romcom wtv im fucking love one piece. its portrayed childish but battles deep asf themes and everything is linked and the plot is so deep, every arc is an adventure, every moment feels like you're with the mugiwara no ichimi. One piece legit makes me smile my dick off like why is this so goddamn good. I watched it because I myself wanted to experience this journey, not recommended or planned to watch, it was just a random interest and i don't regret any of it. omfg and even though the pacing is pretty shit in new world, i dont care because it is so goddamn peak man. legit goated and every ost legit puts me in the feels or gets me hyped like the good moments in the show are uncountable. I have to say don't watch one piece for the fights, it's not about the fights, if you're braindead asf then just watch like dbs or naruto or some shit if u want goated fights. The fights are mediums for the storytelling and the progression of characters instead of state of the art animation but 0 backbone anime battles. not saying the fights are bad because wano has had me creaming every single second in terms of production quality. Characters are just so lovable and every arc leaves you satisfied with a smile on your face, and it's just so nice seeing each character face their problems and how Luffy always pulls up when shit matters most. Every character on the crew is just so fleshed out more than any other side characters I've ever seen, it truly feels like you know them personally. For me, being on this journey is something I will never regret. Every mystery just gets me hyped asf to find out more about. I fucking love one piece and its not fucking mid you dogs.

"Imagine a world where we had a One Piece anime, that stuck to the story very closely with no BS filler, good pacing, and animated by a studio like Madhouse. Sounds great, doesn't it? I wish this was reality, because one of the greatest Shonen Manga ever written deserves so much more than the garbage we got that is this anime. I don't even know how many episodes I've actually watched since I must have skipped at least 150 because they were filler/extremely poorly paced. This anime is also the reason I will never even bother to watch shows like Dragon Ball Z or Naruto, because the experience they offer is going to be the exact same, with a ridiculous amount of episodes and godawful pacing with mediocre animation. One Piece didn't start off too bad, actually. From East Blue to Marineford, the show was consistently good. It had its share of fillers and poor pacing, but compared to Post-Timeskip stuff, it's literally a drop in the ocean. The story and characters are a 10, obviously. Each of the Straw Hats are lovable and you have a lot of fun with them. The villains are top notch, and many of my picks for the best anime villains ever come from One Piece alone. The story is excellent as well, it's interesting, it's exciting, and it's extremely emotional at points. The animation is also pretty unique; it still stands the test of time and doesn't look outdated. This holds true, until we get past Marineford and into Fishman Island Arc. Everything took a very sharp nosedive, whether it was the animation quality, the pacing, or the sound effects, it was a major step down from anything Pre-Timeskip. The animation is quite lazy in many places, Fishman and Dressrosa especially. While it's not Seven Deadly Sins Season 3, for a show that rakes in so much money, you'd think they'd at least put in effort for the animation, instead of not giving a shit until a major fight takes place. The animation does get a whole lot better for the most part now that we're in Wano since it's the most hyped One Piece arc ever, but even then it has problems with animation. And everything other problem still holds in the Wano Arc. The pacing is easily the absolute worst thing about this show. They extend every page in the manga for as long as possible to fit the 24 minutes per episode, and it's not uncommon for 7 minutes of an episode to be the OP and recap from the previous episodes. This show recently hit 900 episodes as well, so good luck trying to go through all of it, filler included. Speaking of fillers, they should at least be interesting, in order to justify being in the show despite not being in the original works, but it doesn't even have the courtesy to do that. I did try watching the filler at some point and I've yet to be even remotely interested in any of them. The sound design is also atrocious in the anime, especially in Dressrosa and Whole Cake Island Saga. Every punch, kick, sword slash, and gunshot feel hollow and lifeless, like they're just hitting a tree with a stick, and the OST, while great, is overused a lot in Post-Timeskip. The voice acting is fine for the most part, but there are certain characters where they're simply too over-the-top to take seriously and you're just annoyed by them. The running sounds are what irks me the most; does everyone wear tap dancing shoes or something?! Shit grates my ear every time someone walks or runs, it's infuriating. I'm only following the anime now because I'm such a huge fan of the manga and Wano is indeed hype AF but man, this series really deserves better than the anime. 4.5/10",4,Not Recommended,"Jan 21, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_870f4c924b,36,3571
"Brazilian version:: Para o gênero shounen, One Piece tenta inovar ou trazer alguma mudança no meu ponto de vista. A temática pirata, se encaixa muito bem, isso sem exagero. Além disso os personagens, podem ser marcantes, emocionantes, carismáticos entre outras características. Em geral, durante o anime tu vai se lembrar e relembrar deles e não do jeito que pareça muito forçado para quem assiste. As ilhas e o universo de One Piece e muito bem construindo, tirando a parte da ilha dos homens peixes e outros arcos secundários que são mais para passar o tempo. Retomando aos homens peixes, o criador Eiichiro Oda, simplesmente não trouxe aquele espirito de que o ""Novo Mundo"" seria desafiador, foi um arco só para mostrar que os personagens eram fortes e que tinham ganhado melhores habilidades, foi muito fraco esse arco, se quiserem podem ler o mangá que é mais rápido. Mas, tem boas notícias o arco de wano, o arco atual, tá sendo incrível tanto no mangá quanto no anime, um arco pra dizer que o novo mundo não é brincadeira e que se você estivesse passando nesse momento, nessa ilha, iria ser a pessoa mais corajosa e forte que iria conhecer e pagaria uma bebida num bar. Mas, terminando a resenha, vale apena dar uma olhada em One Piece, e quem parou ou desistiu voltem a ver, vale muito apena.

The islands and the One Piece universe are very well built, except for the fish men island part and other secondary arches that are more to pass the time. Returning to fish men, creator Eiichiro Oda, simply did not bring that spirit that the ""New World"" would be challenging, it was an arc just to show that the characters were strong and that they had gained better skills, this arc was very weak, if wish they can read the manga which is faster. But, there is good news, the wano arc, the current arc, is being amazing both in the manga and in the anime, an arc to say that the new world is no joke and that if you were passing by right now, on this island, it would be the bravest and strongest person I would ever meet and buy a drink at a bar.

"Summary at the bottom if you dont wanna read all this warning: spoilers General review introduction: I started watching OP a bit over 3 months ago and I have around 40 eps left until I get caught up at the time I'm writing this. Disclaimer: One Piece is my favorite anime and favorite show of all time so I might be a bit biased Story: Incredible. On the outside it might seem really simple; the classic shonen story of some kid who wants to be the pirate king or fifth hokage or whatever, but theres actually a deeper, much more interesting story behind all that. It takes a few hundred episodes for it to fully reveal itself fully, but there are hints at the overall story starting as early as Alabasta with the introduction of the Poneglyphs. It's been 20 years and we still don't know the full story yet, but we have the basics. Art: For the first 200 eps or so the art style and animation is not nearly as good as it is today, but it was made a long time ago so its not really a big deal. You get used to it really quickly and once it turns HD it gets a lot better, but gradually gets better before that as well. It really reaches its peak at Wano Kuni Arc (890-) where it looks absolutely amazing and it really brings out the best in all the characters. Sometimes, fight scenes were slightly monotonous and (rarely) a chore to watch, but in Wano its never boring due to the incredible animation and colors that are always blasting across the screen at any moment. It's on par with ufotable's KNY, and thats saying a lot. Sound: OST is fire, gives me chills sometimes, the OPs are all great but my favorite is hands down Fight Together. Character: Really good. Enies Lobby, Whole Cake Island, Thriller Bark, Drum Island, Alabasta, and pretty much all of the arcs have one character or Straw Hat member at the center of them, and each of these makes you like them so much more. Before Arlong Park I fucking hated that bitch Nami, but now I don't hate her (shes still my least favorite member though). Before Whole Cake I didnt really like Sanji that much because of that one time he told Jimbei to kill himself because he indirectly caused Nami pain. Which is bullshit. But WCI made me like him a lot more. OP is great at making you care about characters and making them endearing and interesting. Enjoyement: If I didn't enoy this show I wouldn't have binged almost 950 eps of it in like 3 months, It's fucking awesome, you should go watch it if you haven't its worth it. OVERALL (SKIP HERE) One Piece is the best anime I've ever seen. It makes me cry, laugh, and it sends chills down my spine. Sometimes it does that all in the same episode. I truly believe that the Summit War Saga is a work of art. It has a perfect balance of horror (sabaody), comedy/fanservice (amazon lily), comedy/suspense (impel down), and an epic action filled war (marineford). Those 100 or so episodes made me realize how great OP was and secured its eternal #1 spot.

"My only ever completely biased 10/10 across all boards, One piece is simply my favorite anime of all time. OP has enough fanfare surrounding it so I'll spare the individual criterions that encompass my score. Instead, let us address why it gets low scores from some people in the first place. I am well aware of the flaws; the art is odd to some, the presence of the shounen recap syndrome of wasting the first five minutes behind the flashbacks, extending scenes that weren't so dragged out in the manga, its gigantic length compared to most anime etc. Now, the thing is most people that criticize OP are manga readers and/or people scared of the length. No matter how amazing the manga is, the anime was what got me into it. That alone deserves the score I gave it. For people with the length issue, I can guarantee they heard sth along the lines of ""it gets better at around episode so-and-so."" I loved OP from the very first episode. Like I said, I'm heavily biased. Skipping the first 5 minutes is natural to me. I never skip the 2 minute long openings because I love the foreshadowing. I watched every filler as well, and I liked them all. What can I say, I've been hooked from the start. And as for it being dragged out more than the manga, I don't have the time in my busy schedule to stay up-to-date, so the anime is the only way I get to experience it. Once an arc finishes airing I binge the whole thing then put in on hold till the next one ends, as such length is never a problem. The longer the better, why would I want the fun to stop? What I'm saying is, I love it so much that I adapted to its flaws. Maybe that's what we should strive for really, to find sth we love no matter what flaws it has; to be truly content in love. If you are interested to find out why I say this, maybe try watching a few eps, no pressure.

"When it comes to One Piece you either love it or you hate it with a passion. I'll be the first to admit that as a huge fan of the series its not the best shounen of all time but it's still a really good show nevertheless. One of my very few complaints about the show is how after over 20 years a lot of the sound effects are basically the same with a few new ones added during certain scenes in specific arcs like it shouldn't be that hard to find or create new ones from time to time, another one of my complaints is more aimed towards anime fans than the actual show itself and that's that people are immediately put off because of the insane amount of episodes it has. The power system I personally think is one of the most unique I've seen in anime in a long time, I often catch myself wishing I had a certain Devil Fruit that is super OP. The characters are also really unique I mean like Luffy has a Cyborg, a dead body and even a blue nosed reindeer that talks on his crew, each crew mate has their own role to play and their interactions with each other are sometimes absolutely hilarious. I could easily recommend this anime to anybody as long as you have the patience to get through the boring parts. I've found myself getting attached to certain characters really quickly and have grown to love them more and more every time I see them on screen. I don't have much else to add other than if you've been putting off watching or reading One Piece you should just do it because you won't regret it and even though it might get boring it tedious in the beginning it gets a lot more interesting later on. TLDR: You will either love it or hate it but you should at least give it a try before deciding you hate it because of the amount of episodes.",9,Recommended,"May 2, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_16d2a969cd,36,1752
"Hey, what's up? This is a One Piece midstream review. Taking time out around the time-skip to review OP once and for all...until it ends? In 2035? Or doesn't end. We don't care, this story doesn't have to end for it to be important. So, you're wondering, should I watch OP? It's too long, maaaaan! I get it, it IS too long...of enjoyment. It's filled with gutbusting laughs and hurrah moments and manly manliness. I get it, we don't have time, it's hundreds and hundreds, a THOUSAND episodes! I can't take this, I really can't take this. You don't have the right, oooooh you don't have the right. I get it, life is short, why invest time in this longass anime? Ain't nobody got time for that, I'll keep it simple and watch Naruto instead. However, let me let you know that this is in fact a priceless piece of @ss and you're staring at it all wrong. ""Oh, it's just about little kids, I can't stand that, drop it in the first arc."" Yeah, little kid fillers in anime are annoying to me too. And the manga doesn't really go anywhere from the start either. That's where I began, the manga, and I didn't get it at all. I talked about how much I didn't like it, maybe I was obnoxious, I really hope I was. Little kid fillers suck in OP, Naruto, pick your poison. And yet...we're telling A STORY. I get it, it's hard to get into this world. It really is. You're reading this and you're jealous of those 90's Japanese people who had the sophistication to read OP on a train and dedicate themselves to all the stories it was telling. It's 2022! Ain't nobody got time for that. I get it. And yet...when it catches, IT CATCHES. I get that people say Arlong Park is the one. For me, in the manga, it just wasn't for me. Why is every story about little kids? Who is LUEFFY? Why do I care about this island and the fruit Nami is trying to grow? Doesn't make any sense. Truth be told, you had to have a lot of patience. And I think OP got enough chances that it eventually started to become a really good story. It could've been cancelled early on, and you never would've heard of OP, but Shounen Jump gave it enough chances. This is why you don't give up on an artist until you have to. Have a little faith. Especially in your taste in artists, of course. So yeah, this story starts out rough, that's for sure, in the manga obviously. But then, I like anime, I watch anime, the anime is incredible, and that's where it started to truly turn around for me and the vision of Oda-sensei became obvious. I don't know why the manga never clicked for me, but as soon as the anime became bingeable on Netflix, I knew I had to give this series another chance. I don't know why, it just dug at me that I'd never been able to sync with one of the biggest deal animes of all time. So many fans, it felt like an underground club. And it had 1000 eps! I must've been missing something. The manga for me moves far too slow, has way too many little kid backstories, and never gains any kind of momentum. It's a very slow subway line page turner. It's for guys who are bored reading Jump and just so happen to need something to look at and OP just so happens to be there. It's not as good, or flows as well, or gives immediate satisfaction the way Hellsing, Ranma 1/2 or Black Lagoon do (the manga I most want to see back in print). But manga is slow, it is traditionally slow. The big turning point for me was obviously Little Garden, that's the arc where I started to see the forest for the trees and became intrigued. Something about that arc was much bigger, much more masterful than what had come before, this is where Oda started to master his story and a line of imperceptible...something, became obvious. We could now see a clear trail of where this story was headed. Pirates? On an island? And giants? It's so obscure, it belongs in some aristocrat's logbook from the 1700's in France or Germany. And yet...what is it about this story? I thought to myself. So that's 70 episodes in. I know you'll complain, ""That's too loooong! Raaaagh! No time for anime, gotsto go to wooooork!"" Like some shounen jump character, I get it, that's a lot of episodes. Gintama is kind of the same way. Long running shounen series take time. Not every series starts off as exciting and interesting as the iconic Naruto.... And yet, while Naruto's beginning is FAR better than One Piece and far more accessible, especially to westerners who will recognize the storytelling conceits right off (a young boy is isolated and must fight as an individual to gain respect from his senpai and peers), OP is a long, slow churning series. This is a guy pushing a boulder up a mountain, no doubt about it. And as a western individual, you won't recognize the collectivist emphasis on 'friends'. That will be confusing. OP is purely collectivist from the start, while Naruto starts individualist and is always redeemed by 'friends' and collectivism and falls into the trap of collectivist story tropes late in its run, to its detriment. I get it, Naruto has a far better beginning, so does Death Note and so does Fullmetal Alchemist, and Bleach had a few really good episodes as well. I get it, everyone gets it. What is it about OP and long running, grueling shounen series? I get it. But while Naruto, DN and Fullmetal start off really great, their issues become enhanced the longer their series go on. Naruto becomes 'talk-no-jutsu', which might be the greatest criticism against a fictional story ever levied. Fullmetal loses the drive of its narrative arc as its baddie becomes too overpowered and then too underpowered in a couple of quick moments and all the long storytelling is destroyed before you even remember how good it was. DN falls apart as soon as its chief protagonist dies, to the utter detriment of the story and its hype. OP starts off goofy, it should not have been the one, but it is. And it is probably because OP starts off so goofy from nowhere and has so many little kid backstories that its lore is built to a chillingly complete level that most manga outside of Berserk never reach. Because as we all know, the pinnacle of storytelling in manga and anime resides in 'hang out stories', where the characters aren't forced to be action stars and can just breathe and be themselves and explain who they are, this is OP's strength, its ultimate strength, its characters feel like real people. Before Luffy ever goes to a castle to save anybody, you understand who that character is. We know Robin, we get to know Nami, we know Tony Chopper and Frankie. OP bores you with backstories other shounens never would, but in the process you gain something richer. In its first seventy episodes, Oda lays a backstory so rich and fine that it's only later that you appreciate the scale of what he is doing. Luckily for you, there is an anime, with a fine, fine dub, and many, many episodes to binge at a moment's notice when you do really get into this story, with very fine animation. The animation is akin to Miyazaki's glory days, the classic Nausicaa/Nadia/Castle of Cagliostro style, green grass, blue skies and a little bit of hazy mystery on the horizon. It's way better than Pokemon but it's still the classic Japanese art style. Green fields, blue, blue water, big smiling, expressionful eyes and lips. Big hair, it's a basic, classic style, simplistic but it has always done the job in animation. It doesn't try to do too much animation wise, only giving us what we need. Which is why it is so remarkable, peak OP is like Miyazaki fell asleep and you smoked a pipe containing the essence of his very best works, like Totoro or Mononoke, or Spirited Away, and just got carried off to dreamland. Like he's the caterpillar and you're Alice, and you're just carried off to Wonderland. It has many notes and influences from Miyazaki and basically interpolates his style as 'the main style of anime'. Which is why OP reminds you so much of the best Miyazaki movies all the time. There's constantly moments where you take a second to recognize the natural beauty of areas which Oda has built. This foreground is part of what makes OP special. There are so many pretty landscapes like the Grand Line's cliffs, or Sky Island, or Drum Island or Sabaody. Hundreds of eps in you might be tempted to say it's all the same, but I never stop appreciating the Miyazaki notes in the landscapes. Natural, beautiful, unspoiled, the way it should be, a paradise, nature before man ruined it. It opines for something better. Thus OP becomes like a post-Miyazaki paradise. Its characters are special as well, but I won't spoil you. Suffice to say, OP is extremely special and there's a reason it is the TOP anime and one of the best stories going. If you're going to endeavor One Piece, it will take time for you to graft onto the story. I wasn't captured on Oda's entire vision at Arlong Park or anything until his writing started to become one-world traditional. In so many words, One Piece started to carry notes and spice from many classical stories that made it really accessible to me. It felt like fairytales with pirates, fairytales from childhood. That's when I started to realize the enormity of the thing. Little Garden was the start of that. Until then we have some baddies here and there, like Whiskey Peak, that allude to something bigger. But you don't get an idea of how big the world is, nor is the World Government solidified until later. But who knows? Maybe if you start with the anime then everything will click early on, but in the manga I definitely felt lost, even on Baratie with Sanji I had no idea what was going on or why. Basically what I would say to you is, East Blue is tough to get through, that is Oda laying the foundation of his plan and a lot of the time it's like watching paint dry. No doubt, it's a tough first part of the story. It's not like Death Note, Naruto or Bleach, it doesn't come in bombastic, flashbombing you with an interesting backstory. OP starts off more innocent. I would argue that Oda was finding his sea legs. OP legions will stand up and shout that Oda had it all planned out from the beginning and it was always a masterpiece, but I beg to differ. Things were shaky at the start. So for westerners, that's going to be hard to take, that this story doesn't hit you from the start. There's no death pen, or scoundrel in the village living on his own and being abandoned by everyone, there's no sexy older woman living in the cupboard of your bedroom, there's no vampires or biker chicks with guns. OP is a much more peaceful series, out on the seven seas, away from all that. At its heart, One Piece is about peace. That's going to be tough for westerners to take. More often than not, dudes are just chilling or having frank discussions about this or that. There is no bombast, there are no big bads from the beginning. Dudes are just lazing around, chilling, sailing or talking crap. East Blue is okay. OP doesn't become OP until the Grand Line, that's where OP really starts to take off. The question is if you have the patience to get through East Blue to Arabasta and the Grand Line around sixty eps in? Which you should, because OP is a masterpiece and you know around ep 180ish that OP is a masterpiece that will keep on giving. Is it the GOAT? Yes, probably, now that Berserk will go unfinished, OP is right there with Berserk, except it has an anime and a great dub and amazing music. The openings are always so danceable. I would recommend getting into OP immediately, the story is incredible, the characters are amazing and everyone in this story becomes like your own family. Heck yeah I recommend OP. One Piece after the Grand Line starts is basically like watching a movie all the time. The pacing only has issues if you're watching week to week. Otherwise, the anime is way better than the manga. I just couldn't ever get into it very well. But maybe the manga gets really good around the Grand Line as well. Yes, I would put in the work, get through the East Blue saga over 60 episodes and start really enjoying one of the greatest anime series of all-time from Grand Line on. Ranking the arcs: All>East Blue, to start. Among the fantastic arcs, which is everything after East Blue, the only one that is less than perfect is perhaps Thriller Bark. The rest are excellent to perfect, and Thriller's dumb baddie is the only real issue, just because he's kind of lame. Once you get through East Blue this story is kind of masterpiece after masterpiece. If you sat through EB I'm not sure anybody couldn't enjoy Arabasta, Sky Island or Water 7. It's like if someone made a long anime series out of all the best Miyazaki films, it's that good. It has the same kinds of values in my opinion, friends, companionship, love, the good normie ones, with the same kinds of backgrounds and good characters. One Piece is an anime that truly lives up to the legends of before, who made anime what it is today from the '70s, '80s and '90s. It gives you everything you ever wanted and is very pure. True, there is no romance really, no adult themes like Black Lagoon or Hellsing. But it is a palate cleanser. The true themes of One Piece are far bigger and more universalist than you could ever hope to imagine. Eventually you realize that OP is a political anime about the evils of neoliberalism. The pirates symbolize the hope for freedom and the chaos that ensues without order. The navy represents the lie of justice and the fact that crime will always be rampant. The world nobles are an evil class of aristocrats protected by the navy who think that they're serving justice. One Piece is about a world whose laws and customs rely on lies rather than truth, obfuscation over simplicity. While pirates represent chaos they also represent man's wish to be free. The navy represents man's wish to repress the desires of the middle class and rule over them with an iron fist and steal the proceeds of their hard work. I would not say OP is communist or egalitarian. Rather it represents the need for individuals to feel needed, respected and required, rather than discarded, repressed or oppressed. While it has many collectivist sentiments like its emphasis on 'friends', its emphasis is really on community overall. Trusting, feeling safe in, and requiring community that is respectful towards the individual. OP does not respect law and order without generosity or care. Luffy does not respect a lawman who is corrupt, fat, docile or feeding off the classes he or she oppresses. Luffy stands for freedom and justice. This is very different from every other shounen anime. OP actually has values which only become apparent later on in the story. The World Government seems increasingly evil. It represents the ambition to 'MASTER' man and make SLAVES of the lower classes and EXPLOIT the lower classes for all proceeds of THEIR work. It really is that simple: man's dominion over man, due to values one invents upon one's birth: intelligence, class, access to special education or certifications and licenses, entitlement, the profundity of wealth over the work that actually achieves the ends which humanity requires to obtain a society. What is the World Government except parasites on the system? Snatching their own share from a system they have produced no profit in? Luffy is a black eye on all of that. Luffy only respects certain values, though even at Marineford, he could not save those closest to him against a system which uses immense strength to achieve its ends. The strawhats bully friend and foe alike if they fall on the wrong side of the path of true justice, which means accountability and honesty. They never have the time or patience for those who would bring ruin to others for their own profit. And that's what makes them so heroic. At the middle point, OP is a dang masterpiece. There's absolutely no doubt. If you're looking for something a little more adult in certain attitudes then it is never going to satisfy you. But anyone who watches OP has no doubt, hundreds of episodes in, that what they are seeing is like a culmination of decades, fifty years of anime. And in many ways it is peak anime, because its values are so universalist. Luffy stands against corruption, he believes in the dignity of every individual and protects them against a system that means to do evil and harm to others. Should you watch OP? Of course you should, it's one of the essentials. Does it take some time and appreciation from a distance to understand where it's going? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean the work isn't worth it. When OP hits for you finally, it will hit hard.",10,Recommended,"May 4, 2022",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_6335f83768,36,16598

"to be honest i was gonna wait until im caught up to write a review but I just finished marineford and I really cant not talk about it! My reviews are usually straight to the point and I don't analyse the story or anything too much so I will try not to give spoilers so feel free to read this if you are unsure about weather or not to start one piece. Now I know there are many views on this show but from my experience 90% or even more of the people who have actually seen one piece, love it! i have had people stop half way or stuff but everyone I have asked who has seen it say they enjoyed the show or are enjoying the show even now. Its why I started watching it 4 months ago. i have also heard from people who know nothing about one piece as to how bad it is? or people who watched like couple episodes and dropped it, don't listen to them like at all. I am trying not to be biased here but one piece has become my all time favourite anime in a matter of 4 months! Its more than an anime for me at this point because the way i see it is that I'm not watching an anime but on a journey with these guys. I never gave a fuck about world building and always focused on character building however...ONE PIECE DOES BOTH SO WELL! so what if its long? HECK I DONT WANT IT TO END! oda is one of the best writers of this generation because of how wonderfully one piece is crafted. The show comes off as if its for kids but its so much more, the themes of politics, justice, slavery, corruption, good, evil...its all there. its done in a way where you yourself look at it and are in shock as to how easy it is to potray these things in a way that doesn't come off preacy or cringy. It took me till the marineford arc to realise how i have been sucked into this world because of the world building and like it all comes together so well especially in this arc. I wont make this too long but characters i have to talk about. Many people tell me they don't like the design especially in the older arcs to which i say...fair. When i first watched one piece i personally loved the art style but i know some people may not but that should not stop you from appreciating the DEPTH EACH AND EVERY CHARACTER HAS!. i am going to ignore the fillers and anime canon and talk about the canon episodes ofc that is written by oda. EVERY CHARACTER even like the side characters provide so much depth not to the main characters but to the island or the world itself. I So many things in the first arc are still relevant later on. But it doesn't seem repetitive at least to me it just works. ALSO LUFFY! the best mc in an anime i have ever seen like...i honestly cant explain it in words but fluffy has every quality of an mc at the right amount where he doesn't come off as fake but someone real after a certain point. i think even the people in the anime are at first like ""whos this dumb kid"" but every person and i mean everyone he interacts with or whoever sees him in actions, grows to respect him because he has the qualities of a captain and a great anime mc. I really have so many things i can talk about but i don't want to make this long so i will just say please give one piece a try. this anime is not over rate or over hyped it deserves every single praise it gets because every part of this anime (except for the pacing lol that i agree but you have to push through taht) is flawless. I watched one piece one day coz i was like eh why do people like it so much, i cant judge it without watching it and here i am almost half way...part of the strawhats for life!",10,Recommended,"Nov 14, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_d786ce194f,36,3552
"I'm gonna keep this review really short since I'm by no means an expert anime reviewer. There are two types of people in this section reviewing one piece: those who hate it and those who absolutely adore it. I have read some reviews and by far I see that most people's problems were: animation issues, pacing issues and art issues. I'm here to address those issues and explain why they haven't affected me that much at all: Animation: I honestly didn't really notice any issues with the animation to be honest, since I'm a casual viewer. And I'm sure that most of us watching anime are casuals, we don't dwell deep into this stuff so it doesn't really affect us in any way. Back in 2015, when Dragon Ball Super was still airing and had terrible issues with the animation, I still didn't notice any problems with the animation, even when I was watching the infamous episode 5. Pacing: Honestly, when you're binging episodes back to back, the pacing doesn't really feel that bad, at least not to me. I could feel on some episodes that they were being dragged out way too long but when you're binging, the feeling quickly goes away and honestly didn't affect me at all. I guess this problem will be really bad now that I have caught up but that still doesn't matter because I have moved on to the manga as of episode 932. Art: The art is great. I don't know what people are talking about honestly. I was also guilty of hating one piece for the art back then but the feeling quickly disappears a few episodes in. Especially in the recent Wano arc, the art work and animation have been really great. I have also seen people having problems with the facial expressions of people crying in one piece, saying that it's ugly. In my opinion, it isn't ugly at all, it feels real and emotional and I personally don't have any problems with it.",9,Recommended,"Jul 15, 2020",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_33718bd053,36,1831
"One Piece is like a roller-coaster ride of emotions. The characterisation and my favorite thing about One Piece is the wonderful worldbuilding. I personally prefer the Manga over the Anime.

It also has Doflamingo, one of the most underrated anime antagonists of all time. Tbh, The series has made me cry alot. One Piece definitely deserves all the recognition it gets. 9/10 at best for me.

GREAT beginner anime, you can never go wrong with any anime in the big three. Great world building and character development, really outstanding. Pacing in the anime might be bad in some arcs but everything else really compensates, there are only two arcs I would rate under a 7 and those are Skypiea and Fishman Island. Greatest arc of all time is Marineford and soon might be Wano. Wano is insanely well built up, has been the goal since post timeskip, around 400 episodes ago. Low filler rate of 10% and might have the greatest main character out here. Favorite character is Bon Clay ofcourse hehe, if you are reading this and just started the anime, goodluck on your journey!

"I honestly really love One Piece!! I put off watching for a long time because of its length but I am so happy I started watching. One Piece has easily become my favorite anime. The is not much that I can criticize. The art is not my favorite but I got over that fairly quickly because of the story line. I do not think I have seen another story like this in an anime or really any other way and I think it is very unique. The reason I give the show a 9 and not a 10 is because of the homophobic and fatphobic coding. I believe that those codings are very dangerous and damaging for those communities. The coding also ruined some of my comfort characters for me. Other than those things I truly adore this anime and I say that as a fat gay. This may not bother other viewers but for my self this coding is unnecessary and damaging.

"The pacing is kind of bad but once you finish it you feel like you need to watch the next episode. Many scenes were iconic definitely watch it and read the manga too.for me it's 10/10 the current arc definitely has a lot of plot twist after the oden backstory.I think i understand why people say it's long because there is a lot of filler episode and the pacing is slow it's definetely has a lot of memories for me Over all it's worth watching and reading One Piece also has its fair share of heart-wrenching moments, which may take you by surprise! There are some EXTREMELY powerful scenes and episodes that kind of blindside you and leave you wondering when you became quite so emotionally attached to certain characters or other things. I've definitely found myself near tears or actually crying at more than one point. One Piece has it all - amazing characters, the never-ending yet never TOO over-the-top humor, exciting battles, fun adventures, heartbreaking moments with quick to follow touching moments. And underneath everything, there's always the theme of friendship and teamwork, of working to reach your dreams and helping those closest to you achieve theirs, of growing and maturing as a person and discovering the power within yourself to overcome obstacles of any sort, of just BEING THERE for the rest of your crew when they need you - of being NAKAMA.",10,Recommended,"May 6, 2021",One Piece,One Piece,21,one_piece_0bfca80105,36,1369

"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything bragworthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsical of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbreat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to melliflous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and endign themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, desptie what Naruto fans, shonen haters or anyone else have said. It's pretty enjoyable despite its lacks and faults, mostly in thanks to its great cast.

"Bleach will always warm my heart no matter how many times I watch it. There are scenes in this anime that I consider iconic to the anime community, regardless of how many people disagree with me, I truly believe Tite Kubo inspired greatness in so many fans. He has the most beautiful artwork I've seen in manga, and while the anime doesn't quite reach the level of skill Kubo possessed, it still presented a beautiful adaptation of his story in a way that impacted millions of people around the world. You can argue that it has cliche moments, or maybe some flat characters, and yeah, the ending was extremely rushed (due to Kubo's poor relationship with his publishers), but none of that matters when compared to the enormous amount of fans who adored Bleach. A community of millions of people were all brought together when Ichigo showed us the power of a human. The strength, emotion, and pain of a human. Human understanding and suffering and friendship and human values. It's not about swords and power ups. Bleach taught us how to love, how to protect, and how to overcome our weaknesses. This is a fictional story with very REAL lessons. And while there are other anime and stories that can teach us about life, there is nothing quite like Bleach. The story captured me at every moment, I could relate to every struggle, and I felt my heart melt at every tragedy. I know that not every person will experience something the same way. I know there are many people who feel disconnected from Bleach. But as for me and the Bleach fans around the world, we gained something by watching this treasure. I have a passion and a strength that developed every time Ichigo fought and won his battles. The soul society became my allies. Ichigo's friends were my friends too. Ichigo became my hero. I started this series back when I was 15 years old and even though I'm 22 now, I still find personal strength and encouragement from watching my hero fight for the good in this world. I believe this will live in my heart and mind until the day I die. Bleach is not unworthy of praise, because it truly helped at least one person on this earth find happiness. Nothing is meaningless. Even if only one person finds value in something, it's worth it. Thank you.",10,Recommended,"Jan 24, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fdbfdd75ef,1,2250
"** Bleach had great potential, but became annoying with poor character development and random powers. Bleach has one of my favorite concepts ever. The Soul Society is awesome and the Gotei 13 are probably the best part of the show. They are squads composed of a multitude of Shinigami(Soul Reapers) and the show focuses more on the Captains and Lieutenants of those squads that are the most interesting characters in the show. Although, their could have been less squads(like 6) with less members in them(like 5) to have a more focused cast of characters that get more development. Hollows are also very interesting, they are souls that have either decide to let themselves be taken by evil or have been capture by other hollows. The basic concept is that the Soul Society dispatches Soul Reapers to purify the souls of hollows to let them live in the Seretei(basically heaven) unless they were evil while human( then they go to hell). The Soul Reapers use their swords called Zampakuto, that have 2 transformations to purify hollows. The story of Bleach is ok, it is basically a regular shounen protagonist (Serious while fighting and Over powered) vs a traitorous, power hungry, intellectual villain. Bleach biggest problems are its disrespect of its own power level system, its useless side characters, its horrible explanations for certain powers and its fillers.. Bleach doesn't make sense when it comes to power levels, a character can be defeated by an opponent, and then can defeat someone that utterly destroyed that opponent without training or power ups. I don't know how to describe it without spoilers but the power level system is non existent and it is really aggravating to not see that system in place. Ichigo, the main character, will discover some new ability to beat his opponent that is portrayed as being way more powerful than Ichigo, this will happen multiple times. Ichigo is easily defeated by the main antagonist(villain), that same villain levels up 5 times and is defeated by Ichigo who trained for 3 months. What? at least don't make the villain level up 5 times so it makes more sense. The side characters in bleach are useless. The Captains and Lieutenants aren't, but Ichigo's friends are. First off, Orehime Inoue, F**K is this character annoying. Shes is the typical damsel in distress, she is hot, she tries to be extra cute and she has stupid powers that have no explanation(Maybe Fullbringer). Orehime's only use is healing Ichigo so he can get back into a fight. Chad has *MINOR SPOILER* Fullbringer powers, these are probably the stupidest powers in the Bleach universe. Fullbringer is the abillity to control the souls found inside objects. WTF!! an object has a soul? I guess it does in the Bleach universe. Uryu Ishida is probably the on except-able friend Ichigo has. Uryu is a Quicy, they are similar to soul reapers, but instead of using a sword they use a bow and arrow. They also kill hollows instead of purifying them. The problem with all three of these characters is they become to weak to participate in battles except Uryu who can still provide support in battle. Bleach is almost 50% filler. These can be skipped if you binge watch Bleach but on a week to week basis it can be really annoying to have to watch filler almost every other arc. Although Bleach has a huge list of problems I was still hooked until the last cannon arc because the concept of Bleach was so interesting. The Soul Society and the captains are the main reason I continued to watch the show. The most annoying part of Bleach for me was its lack of explanation and logic for powers, Ichigo's friends that shouldn't have existed, especially Orehime and the fact that the main characters can just come full circle and defeat a character that should be way above them in terms of power.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 28, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_781225b67d,1,3809
"Story: Bleach is a mixed bag as far as story goes. The first arc (ep1-63), which covers the soul society, is interesting and engaging. It contains both action and a good plot. However, after episode 63 things go downhill. A lot. The Bount arc which follows it isn't even in the manga and has no relevance to the overall story, as well as being entirely uninteresting. It picks up a bit when the story shifts back to the plotline of the manga, but there isn't much of a plot to follow at that point. Basically, the main characters fight the bad guys from there on out with little else of interest to be found. If the action was great, it might make up for this, but it isn't. While it isn't terrible, it is never enough to carry the anime by itself. In addition, there are frequent fillers, which I would recommend ignoring entirely if you decide to watch this. Aside from the generally uneventful plot, Bleach suffers from an unwillingness to kill off anyone. Despite having tons of shinigami, Bleach never kills off a single one. The only characters who ever die are the bad guys, and very few of them ever perish either. If I were rating only the first arc, I would give this a 7 or an 8, but the decay which has happened since then forces me to drop it significantly to a 5. Art: Character design is excellent, overall very solid animation. It does occasionally have issues though. Sound: Sound is generally good, music appropriate to the mood. No complaints here. Character: This is where Bleach should shine, but doesn't. As said before, character design is great. However, there are so many characters that none of them get any sort of development. With the sheer volume of characters in the show, even main characters are often forgotten for several episodes. Most of the characters seem like they would be interesting if developed, but they simply aren't. Overall: I would recommend watching the first 63 episodes and dropping it there. Aside from the Turn Back the Pendulum story (206-212) there is essentially nothing of value plotwise after that point. If you're only in it for the action, I suppose Bleach is a decent show. But even in that case, you could do much better.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 1, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_70c7a0361a,1,2184
"Bleach has become one of the most popular anime around, and is commonly if not always, compared to Naruto. Hated by many, loved by many, this anime will be watched by virtually everyone who dives into the anime world. Story: The story, or perhaps setting to be more accurate, is quite unique. Shinigami, or Soul Reapers, that have their own special society watch over the souls in the living world. Each Shinigami carries a unique sword(soul slayer) or Zanpaktou that has its own unique name and abilities based on the wielder's style and personality. Alongside them are the Hollow, and two subgroups later to be known as the Vaizard and Arrancar. It is this unique setting that gives Bleach the power to create so many characters under such a captivating environments, and this I believe, is one of the story's strong points. In terms of plot, it isn't very strong. The whole 'rescue a friend' is seen in pretty much every anime, and the whole 'I need to get stronger to protect my friends' is equally overdone. But I personally enjoy watching series with this type of theme, so I can't mark it down because of such overdone plot devices. But Bleach also comprises by adding a few twists into a seemingly transparent storyline, and it is here that I again am impressed. Bleach isn't just about mindless violence, its about friends striving to help each other, looking out for each other and improving themselves. Theres a bit of romance tossed in too, so thats a bit of a plus. The great setting and positive themes of friendship and perseverance made me give this an : 8/10 Characters: Bleach has a huge number of characters, some of them developed fairly well, otherwise poorly. But it is the huge cast of such unique and usually admirable individuals that makes this anime so captivating. You just hold your breath everytime someone pops into release their soul slayer or release their Bankai. It's because of all these characters and their own unique swords and abilities that makes the fights in this anime worth watching. You just can't wait to see what the characters are capable of. In terms of character development, I would say that it isn't bad, especially in terms of Ichigo who starts off as a badass that can take down most hollows with ease. In time, (particularly the current arc) he realizes how insignificant he really is, and tries his hardest to get stronger. The same is similar for the other characters such as Chad. Although most of the character development is in terms of strength and not so much in personality, I still rate the characters high for their largely unique cast: 8/10 Sound: This I find, is one of Bleach's strongest qualities. The soundtracks really intensify the battles and make even the smallest things seem cool. Thats that Bleach is good at - making things seem cool, and the soundtrack is a key and necessary component. But it isn't just the action scenes. It makes the sad and thoughtful moments come alive, in addition to the mysterious and tense situations Bleach presents. It's also accompanied by some of the best opening and closings I've seen in anime, in terms of both music and visuals. They greatly depict the story and the songs set the mood beautifully. 10/10 Art/Animation: I have little to say here. The art is quite good for the most parts, and I loved the coloring in the first few arcs, particularly the bright glowly/misty colors. Most of the fights are animated very smoothly with a variety of scenes and angles and such. Its on par with most anime these days: 8/10 Overall: Bleach is one of my favorite anime, being one of the first I ever watched. I know most people consider it over rated, repetitive and predictable, but hey, it presents some epic fights and follows them through nicely. Most of the fights are a good length (couple episodes) and I'm a fan of swords and people who power up, so what can I say, this anime is gold to me. If you're the type that doesn't care too much about a complicated story or deep compelling characters and you just want to see some epic fights, Bleach is right for you. This deserves an 8/10 overall (bogged down with fillers too much, although I didn't take that into account while rating. Fillers aren't part of the show, just don't watch them =/ ), but I personally love it and rated it a 10/10 on my list.",8,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ffb31e4fbd,1,4316
"---- Spoilers (FIRSTLY THIS SEIRES CONTAINS AT LEAST 40-55% FILLER! ) Bleach: This anime is a cluster-fuck! Nothing more, nothing less. The concept of bleach is actually decent, and it's execution was 8/10 right up till episode 63. The relationship between hollows , humans and shinigami(death gods) was interesting and continued to progress into a rescue mission . This anime honestly should of ended as that! But instead we get shitty plot after plot hole, deus ex machina(shikai >bankai> hollow mask>hyper bolic time chamber) and basic shounen formula... the current manga for this series is in such a shit-hole that there is literally no hope for this series in my opinion ESPECIALLY with the death of Tsukada Masaaki the voice actor of yammamto. Essentially, the plot for bleach has devolved to a transparent sequential pattern>> i.e ( antagonist enters op status ( aizen) where it canonly be matched and beaten by ultra op status ( ichigo))>> the end. STORY 4/10 It's saddening that really the only redeeming quality of this series is the sound !Shirō Sagisu the music producing god behind such titles such as NGE , black bullet and ofc BLEACH! 9/10 ART: for the first 63 episodes art was definitely 8/10 , honestly even with the lower ratio, the quality of animation and art were superior to the other 300 so episodes... In fact I'd go as far as to say that every episode after 63 is 4/10 in art rounding to 6/10 overall . Characters are thrown into the series in hope that the viewer will like at least one, the main problem with this is that there is virtually not nearly enough time to distribute to each character evenly leaving low amount of needed character development and understanding. 5/10 Enjoyment: There are definitely some good fighting scenes, but there is way too much inconsistency in the story and the power levels between the characters leaving for some predictable plot. 5/10 Overall this series is mediocre as fuck, and it's a shame. I really felt kubo could of rapped up this series ages ago and went on to another one... the first 63 episodes of bleach had a certain flavour to it that couldn't be tasted by any other anime just the versatility of the characters and the interaction between them were interesting. BUT FILLER AFTER FILlER + the cannon material becoming saturated really made this series barely watchable! 4/10",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_48220b7017,1,2355
"Bleach is a good choice for you if you're looking to observe the process of the mainstream anime of the 2000's and what they tried to pull off to sell and stay relevant. Outside of the popularity that it got, I see Bleach as a very stale and mediocre anime, which I'll go and detail in the review later, but I'd like to start with the cause and then the effects. You see, Bleach is a product of a time when a shounen reaches popularity to an extent that it can be milked, hinduism will then sue the studios and authors in question for treating their cattle with such disrespect, because those innocent cows have like four japanese businessmen attached to all ends of the udder, with them chugging the milk hard. The strategy was to sell it like it's crack-cocaine, because people will love it and people will buy it because it is something that fits their business strategy. But how did the studios get the warm & sweet cow milk? Here, I'll guide you through it if you wanna do the same. First of all, the source material needs to have garnered some popularity from the target audience desired. Then, as your next step you make sure that it is gonna be a battle shounen and that it does feature some form of fanservice. Third, you make sure to influence the source material in a way that the show will keep its cast mostly out of mortal danger and will turn any of the cool villains into protagonists. And also make sure that nobody dies so you can milk the character popularity too. Fourth make sure you never take a break from airtime ever and air constantly, even if there is no content to adapt. Create filler arcs so the author has time to write content for the anime to adapt. They don't have to be memorable or interesting, you already hooked in the audience. They'll watch anything, so they don't deserve any quality. And then you are set for as long as the author complies. Some free advice on how to keep animating content and delay running out of source material: Make sure to rehash as much material as possible, showing as many flashbacks as possible whenever the character reminisce something important or just make a bullshit reason like trying to remind the audience what the characters are fighting for. It will help you plenty. Don't forget you think your audience is just filled with complete idiots. Very important. What shows like Bleach aspired to be was the next Dragon Ball, because that for most was like crack-cocaine. Since the DB franchise did it first, we just have to do it and make sure we capitalize on all the things it did and make our shows as close in execution as possible, and not risk anything because it won't sell. This is kinda why shows like Bleach disgust me. They just don't aspire in any way to be artistically distinguishable and just try to be the same thing as their spiritual predecessors. They treat their audience like garbage and the only reason I came come up with for such a thing is the reward, which is the money. If this business scheme worked, why not use it? Each of these goliath shounen shows have some varying degree in certain aspects of sins in these departments, but they're all the same when boiled down. Another attempt at getting another Dragon Ball on the market. If you can't respect that, you can just stop reading the review, you read enough. If the show will have potential early, it will dissapoint you because it went nowhere with it. If it won't, you'll be dissapointed again because you had nothing to show for at all after spending some time through it. But if you still hold some interest for Bleach, keep reading, because now I'll get into the actual show itself. But note that I'll spoil some things in the story for like the first 15 episodes of the show. The show has 366 episodes so it kinda is hard to not give you any specifics on the story's direction without giving you any specifics. I strongly advice reading despite that, I did my best to avoid it being plot specific and in a series like Bleach, having a little knowledge of what you'll watch, from where I'm standing, is strongly adviced. The story of Bleach early seems to be about a high school student who gets super powers and has to fight and protect people from spirits that failed to pass away to the other world. And for the most part, he spends his time going through high school featuring some slapstick humor along the way and then, in his responsabilities as a shinigami, he has to fight gigantic monstrous beings with a big fucking sword. Sounds like nothing. As a matter of fact, for the most part, Bleach is mostly generic in terms of its action and story, but it does have a high point. In its introduction arc the series does build itself up. First it does build up the main character, and his overall attitude towards saving people. He isn't unwilling to save people that he sees that do need help, but he isn't exactly accepting of the idea that he would go around and make a day out of it. The way he described it at the time that ""Of course I'm gonna help someone if I see they need it. But I don't want to seek doing it."" And for a while the series tries to convince him to get to do what he can to take care of everyone and Ichigo constantly does it reluctantly. But that plays into a meaningful decision. Another thing that was constantly built up in the series was the Spirit Society, a society governed by people with the same powers as Ichigo, responsible for the protection of spirits and fighting against corrupt ones. The character responsible for Ichigo having to fight these spirits leaves in order to protect him and not make him also suffer consequences as a result of her actions. He is unsatisfied with her decision and runs off to find her. And so he does, just to find another two people, of whom one proceeds to destroy him in battle, with him being a subordinate of the other. And then a meaningful thing happens. After this sore defeat, Ichigo decides to try and save her. To infiltrate Soul Society. After losing his powers. And after being overpowered. He made a decision about who he wants to protect and why, and goes in to save her despite all odds, in a world filled with an uncountable number of people who might be potentially much more powerful than him, willing to simply just go alone. It feels like an adventure with odds stacked against him with who knows what might come against him. The show is respectable at that point and the decision makes sense and feels meaningful. The Soul Society Arc is pretty much where the non-fanatics of Bleach agree that the show was at its strongest. And I'm one of those people. Now don't worry, I'll stop with the spoilery stuff now, so you won't have to worry about what you'll read on ahead. All I will say that in the Soul Society arc, our characters will explore uncharted territory and have fights of their own. Most of the fights will focus on presenting the personality and motivations of the characters and show off the world. It's the most well executed arc out of the entirety of Bleach, because there's a sense of urgency because you don't know how events will play out and it does pretty much feel like a rescue mission. But everything falls apart after this arc. Fillers with irrelevant events will start pilling up, which even the most thirsty of fans tend to skip. The fights just become a mess where the character who's strongest wins until the other character reveals a ""final form"". That will be the basic structure of all the fights for the series' remaining airtime and actual abilities and what they do won't matter, because ultimately, the strongest in raw power will win. All of the action of the series is stale and the character motivations just don't matter. Fuck, each character has different abilities and that plays so little into how fights go around, that they feel almost incompetently choreographed. They just seem to bank on pure hype alone. While Ichigo has an interesting execution at the start, he's a very standard shounen protagonist who fights to protect his friends from harm, he's hot headed, has spikey hair and is fucking terrified of those things women have on their chest or between their legs. He is an archetype that even at the time was treading water. All the other character don't matter since the series removes all the tension and urgency by making everyone make peace amongst themselves and just introduce some new enemies so a constant clash of I'M STRONGER THAN YOU DIE will come. The overarching villain of the series is some dude thirsty for power for the sake of power. Otherwise known as a cartoon villain. Everything in Bleach is as generic as possible. Bleach aired for 8 years. In these 8 years, the artstyle suffered some changes. From first having that choppy VHS aimed type animation with some degree of bad color balance it eventually ends up being one of those series that didn't figure out how to draw the outline of the characters without making them oversharpened, so everything is constantly looking blurry. Also the color balance often feels too strong when dark colors aren't involved. In the first few years it was introduced, it had some pretty interesting tracks that in all honesty, I can enjoy listening to these days. Then eventually transitioned to airing some harmonical/classical tracks in its wake. They're not bad, but the first aired tracks for the series have a very distinct feeling. So if you decide to watch Bleach do it if one of the following descriptions apply to you. You're just looking for a long running action series and don't really care about the structure of the fighting and think that the raw power type drawn fights will entertain you. Or you're looking to look into the way the business strategy of selling off the next Dragon Ball failed and Bleach is a particularly strong choice because it's already kinda faded out of relevance. It doesn't really have really strong action and early it mostly was used to develop characters. Then it was just colored blasts or final forms. Or both. The humor is slapstick and well... you can find that type of humor pretty much anywhere. No need to find it in Bleach. And Bleach just is a very generic show that aired for a really long time. Ultimately, Bleach was passed off as milk. But most people know better than to drink Bleach.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 12, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_114bcf6604,1,10310
"Bleach, Bleach, Bleach. It has alot of popularity, and for reasons I don't know because I find it awful. I have given Bleach a lot of chances and I think I have seen enough of Bleach to give a review. ==STORY== One of Bleach's many bad points is its story, it's about as typical as a story gets. The premise is basically 'save the girl' and 'beat the strong people'. That is it, often running into huge monsters that never really seem like much competition. The story never improves, every arc starts the same. Ichigo in school hanging around with his horribly annoying, useless friends, then a new enemy will show up, capture someone or blow up something, then it is up to Ichigo to save the day. This process isn't quick either. One fight would be 4-6 episodes of struggle before something actually develops, and thus leads to many hours of boredom. But from the Soul Society Arc to the Arrancar Arc, Bleach never excels, it's stuck in one spot it can't seem to get out of. ==CHARACTERS== Oh God, something actually worse than the story. Characters, let's start with our protagonist Ichigo, I'd say he is about as interesting as a wooden post. I didn't realise main characters can lack such depth, but it's possible, Ichigo is a character that never develops, his personality, his relationships. The only thing that Ichigo actually improves in the whole series is his strength, but everything else tends to remain the same. We are left with a very boring, serious character, surrounded by several really happy characters. His school friends are very annoying, Inoue seems to follow too deep into the cliche, ""damsel in distress"" because that is basically all she provides, often his other friends will try to join in on the action and get beat up. Ishida starts out as a potential threat to Ichigo, then ends up far behind, Chad is big... and this soon becomes natural, the unimportant classmates, (Keigo and the Lesbian in particular) will provide moments of forced humour, to the point where you would want to repeatedly hit yourself with a lead pipe. Then you'll have the 13 division captains and lieutenants. Basically just a horde of characters, in fact, too many characters that will get about 1 or 2 fight scenes then become unimportant to the rest of the story. The antagonists are either extremely insane or extremely moody and that is all you get, I tried to analyse deeper into the supporting characters, but then I realised the characters aren't deep enough to delve into, what you see is what you get. ==ART + ANIMATION== Well backgrounds aren't exactly awful. They provide with fairly decent backdrops. Sometimes you'll wonder where all of the people are but while not anything special backgrounds are colourful and scenery contrasts well. Art is very inconsistent for the most part. Good episode, rushed the next. You don't know what you are going to get and it becomes really unpredictable. Character designs, not so good. Sometimes you'll wonder if a 5 year old designed some of the characters because they tend to be very different looking. Some characters will look incredibly standard, and others odd, the inclusion of a hollow hole for me is unnecessary because it just adds to the strange character designs for most hollows and arrancar, just a huge, randomly-placed, gaping hole going through their bodies. Reason? I have no idea. Just to add to the stupidness maybe. Well, they are about as strange as their choices of names and fanservice is extremely common, just about every woman other than Rukia has massive breasts, I think its just a ploy to make most of the women memorable since they seem to lack character. Rukia is perhaps is the only female in the series with any character. Animation is not fantastic, you'll find yourself laughing at most running motions. Fight scenes are incredibly boring, it feels like the animators took every shortcut they could to make the fights easier to animate, movements of characters are far too static and stiff, I would like the characters to loosen up and fight properly but in the end it gets repetitive to the point where it is unwatchable, and all they tend to do is bash swords together for several episodes, using energy blasts and flying into eachother at high speeds. Yes, it's DBZ with swords, the only thing is DBZ managed to pull those fight scenes off and make them interesting. The main problem with the fight scenes is that there is no fluidity, no originality, everybody has the same thing: Sword strike and energy blast. But most importantly it is the lack of style that ruins it, it's like no one has freedom when they fight. Since most of Bleach is fighting, I judge most animations on the fights which is perhaps the biggest disappointment I get when watching Bleach, as I am a big fan of well choreographed fights in animation. ==SOUND== The sound in Bleach succeeds a lot of the time. OPs and EDs are good, you can see the standard of music for Bleach is high, as people are usually disappointed when a series changes OPs and EDs, but with Bleach the current OP is usually just as good as the previous. Background music also fits very nicely, it is actually Bleach's strong point, the music is very refreshing. And usually suits moments. The only problem is that after a while you will hear the same songs, this isn't much of a problem but you can tell after a while the music variety starts to become limited. Voice acting is standard, sub and dub. ==CONCLUSION== Bleach is just an overhyped shonen. Most of the time I sit there watching, incredibly bored, the series never really goes anywhere, the pacing is really bad, things tend to take too long, fights drag on. The series has been running for too long. There are too many fillers, too many characters, not enough development, I don't care enough for the characters. It's boring conversation followed by boring battle every episode. After the Soul Society Arc I thought I'd give up on Bleach until a better Arc comes out, when the Arrancar Arc came out I was excited thinking that Bleach would finally excel to heights I'd expect. But it was all a big disappointment, I am now in the Shinigami v Arrancar Arc and so far I have been wasting my time and I am ready to give it all up. Basically, it is a modern, lackluster DBZ laden with huge swords, uninteresting characters and fanservice. I feel, when watching Bleach I am just missing out on better series'. I don't just want to flame Bleach because it is overhyped, but I really don't think Bleach has any of the qualities that make anime good. Overall, I really wish it was better",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 31, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6d59f29c84,1,6582
"One of the most mediocre animes I've watched. Episode 311 was my limit. I have no clue why I'm still watching this anime other than the fact that I can procrastinate a good 22mins every week, this week was, however, exceptionally frustrating. The storyline is decent, but constantly revolves around the I'm-going-to-whack-you-until-you-die-so-that-I-can-protect-some-people-that-arent-even-going-to-be-hurt-by-you, oh I forgot that they spend no time trying to solve any conflicts peacefully, they just get straight into drawing their sword, and dueling it out with as LITTLE effort as possible? Why? Because, they will put in a little more effort the next week, and just a little more effort the week after, before deciding that I'm-going-to-take-you-down-now-with-my-super-ultimate... which will take another week before the fight is resolved. What an utter waste of time. Too predictable, and a total lie if anyone tells you there is characterization. The last 50 episodes has either been filler, or raw fighting. Ichigo continues to fight everything he sees and threaten everyone with his big sword without ever giving a care about resolving conflicts out of combat, same goes for almost every creature in the show. Initially the show was definitely enjoyable, what with the interesting idea of shinigami and their shikai+bankai... 311 episodes in, I'm sure few of us, other than the 12 year old kids will continue to enjoy this constant plot-less circle around karakura town. Where will the show go from here on? Well, I hope it ends, because surely there is NOTHING left to talk about? But golly me, I'm sure everyone will resurrect and powerup, just like they have been doing the past 311 episodes and it will not be a surprise if there is a ultimate-kai along the way which will then be countered by a super-ultimate-kai. What a waste of time, but I'll keep watching it, until it drops below the 5 I'm rating it now. Thank god shitty Naruto actually turned out better than I thought, as stubborn as Ichigo, but at least hes much more mature and likable than that violent criminal that is Ichigo.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e7adef9a01,1,2103
"When I started watching Bleach, I couldn\'t get enough of it. Not only is it fun to watch but th storyline was fast moving and character exploration was something that I definitely looked forward to. I must admit, like Naruto, it has slowed down a lot and is just dragging for the sake of being on the air, but I still watch it every week. The protagonist of the story is Ichigo Kurosaki - who through some circumstance becomes a shinigami on earth. He is joined in the defense of earth from Aizen with his friends who have awoken their power through his influence. The trials and tribulations of friendship, honor, trust and loyalty is the underlying theme of the anime - very similar to Naruto. Simply put, it is a story of good versus evil and standing up for what you believe in.",9,Recommended,"Jul 13, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_86353caa11,1,783
"Story: 7/10 The story of Bleach is fantastic at times and dull at others. Episodes can you leave you at the edge of your seat, unable to stand the thought of having to wait till next week to see what happens next, or begging for current plot to end and to get to the next part where something interesting happens. (Especially if you read the manga in addition to watching the anime) When the story isn't filler it is usually exciting, fast paced, and with plenty of action and epic fight scenes. Unfortunately the filler is why the story loses points as none of it so far has been enjoyable to watch or added anything in terms of character development or exciting plot lines. While the plot isn't very unique, the old tried and true &quot;I must get stronger to save my friends&quot; routine, it does have some interesting plot twists that make it not as predictable as you would think and the conflict between the world of the Shinigami and the world of the Hollow and its impact on Earth, who is caught in the middle, is very fun to watch. Art: 8/10 The art is good compared to a lot of anime I have seen. Nothing groundbreaking but still pretty good. I've noticed a slight lapse in quality during some of the filler but that might just be my imagination. Sound: 9/10 Bleach has a few sound tracks that they reuse and are very well matched up with the mood of the scene. When Ichigo is getting smacked around by a bad guy it will play some dramatic, sinister music. When something sad is happening, it will play sad music. When Ichigo just had one of those &quot;I believe in myself&quot; moments where he unlocks some sort of hidden power in order to overcome a situation, the music reflects that beautifully as well. Character: 8/10 Some characters are extremely well developed and interesting while others exist for the sole purpose of showing off their large breasts. (coughMatsumodocough) Ichigo begins the show as a rather selfish, uncaring person who wants nothing to do with the Shinigami and we get to witness the change in him as he begins to place the welfare of others over his own. Eventually he meets plenty of other memorable characters that are hilarious or awesome in their own way while being mixed in with annoying characters that you wish would hurry up an die. The reason I began to love this show is because of the interaction between Rukia and Ichigo. Their conflicting personalities and the way they play off each other's sarcasm got me hooked on this show right at the start. There are a few other character pairs in this show who make me laugh every time they are together, such as Kenpachi and Yachiru, but none come close to Rukia and Ichigo. There is a little romance thrown in but nothing too deep. In short, you will come across quite a few memorable characters in this show that alone make it worth watching. Enjoyment: 9/10 I love watching Bleach. The fight scenes are great to watch and its a blast trying to predict what happens next and being surprised the following week. The only reason this part does not get a 10 is because of how bad the filler is. It is not fun to watch and leaves you desperate for it to get back to the real story. This show has made my Thursdays far more enjoyable. Overall: 8/10 All in all this is a show worth watching. If you like action then this is the show for you. If you like a unique and intricate plot then you might not enjoy it as much. The show has its good and its bad but the good far outweighs the bad in my opinion. It certainly isn't the best anime out there but it definitely holds a place among the front of the pack.",8,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9b383e3985,1,3601
"Story: Bleach is a shounen anime and with that, people generally expect a decent story with interesting fights, unfortunetly, you don't get that with Bleach. The plot, or lack of one generally stays with the same formula throughout every arc. Ichigo gets a power-up, someone gets kidnapped, Ichigo gets depressed, Ichigo saves them, rinse and repeat. If that weren't bad enough, only bad guys die, while that may not be a problem for some people, the fact that a good guy cannot die really limits the amount of suspense a fight can have. It works for One Piece only because One Piece has a good story and characters that are developed well enough to carry the story. Bleach just doesn't have that. But some positives are that the fights are pretty decent, though there are a bit too many at times. Art: Studio Pierrot does the art and animation. Just like with Naruto, some episodes are hit or miss in terms of animation, though, they seem to do a better job with Bleach. Sound: The music is pretty good and fits the atmosphere of the anime. I also feel the music has gotten better through the series as it has gone along. Character: This is the area where Bleach could most improve. Kubo Tite did an amazing job with character designs and EVERY character looks simply awesome, but under their flashy exterior, is nothing. These characters, aside from Ichigo, Renji, and Rukia, are severly underdeveloped. They feel shallow and hollow. They are so forgettable, that I don't even know everyone's name, and I'm at episode 150. Enjoyment: I think you get a fair amount of enjoyment out of Bleach. It's far from a masterpiece, but it can be enjoyed, as long as you take it for what it is and accept the limitations placed on it by its creator. Overall: If you're a fan of shounen anime, watch Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter x Hunter, Rurouni Kenshin, and One Piece instead, though if you've already seen those, then Bleach would be a last alternative.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 2, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6c337c2455,1,1938
"I have watched bleach before it became popular and I thought I should give my two sense. Story: Bleach\'s story is pretty straight forward, know the enemy beat up the enemy fight alot of people along the way. It does it pretty well but the one thing that I don\'t like is this animes fillers. They are terrible, I can no longer watch them. Bleach is a action anime and good story, nothing more. But for some reason the makers think they need to try and make it funny with the small filler story\'s. That is just wrong. Its like having a series setting and then throw a clown in the mix WTF! Anyways, that is not all that was wrong with the story. At some point and time they decide to make a huge filler arc and make it all action and your like YAY no stupid puns no dumb characters, but soon you realize and say to yourself \&quot;man this sucks pure action is pointless without a story\&quot; and like many Arnold Schwarzenegger movies you are wondering why you are watching this. (insert name) was good but this is crap. Well let me tell you most action flicks actualy have pretty good back story\'s and do carry them on through the show. And that is my problem with Bleach\'s story. Animation: Excellent characters, amazing backgrounds, just great animation. Sound: Pretty decent but not what I would say good, its music is very electronic and gets very repeated to much. Character\'s: Well despite a rather predictable main character who once again is the only one who can beat everyone, there are a lot of great secondary main characters. They have a lot more depth than Ichigo and are a lot cooler. Enjoyment: Even though all the negatives I have stated it is still very Enjoyable. When the real fights are done and over you will be wowed. Overall: Its a good anime, a lot of people like it and I think the reason is because the action is some of the best and even though Ichigo is kinda flat every other character seems to be more well though out.",8,Recommended,"Jun 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c1d0979acd,1,1955
"Oh, Bleach. What a terrible story. I remember 2004, I was one of those stupid little kids who ""wanted to move to Japan to pursue an anime / manga career"" and felt the ""Japanese culture is kawaii ^___^"". So I'm on my computer, and I thought since I was loving Naruto that I would find another anime to watch. Well on a certain anime website, there was talks about 'Bleach', a popular manga story in Japan which has finally begun an anime on TV. Most people only decided to watch Bleach because Dattebayo started subbing it, but I got it right from the begining when LunarAnime was subbing it. Even when I was 14, I watched the first episode and didn't see what was so amazing about it, but I felt it had a 'cool' concept. Spikey haired stereotypical main character with a huge sword! What's not to love about that in anime when you're just a young teenager? Around episode 16 - 17 (I was having trouble watching this damn anime weekly because I was just bored out of my mind), the story begun to change and we headed into a new story arc. We learned new things and about where Rukia came from, etc. etc. And I felt the story was finally going to get good. Wrong. I was still bored. It felt like the story was going around in circles, over and over. Although the arc did have its fair share of enjoyable moments with some of the battles, it just didn't feel 'epic'. It's near the end of the arc, and Ichigo has finally got a new power up. It was bound to happen, since this IS a Shounen anime. And after 40 episodes of running around, they finally suceeded at what could have probably taken 10 episodes to do. AND THEN WE HAVE AROUND 50 EPISODES OF FILLER. FUN. And so, the current arc comes around and.. What is this? THIS IS JUST LIKE THE OTHER ARC! Only it involves masks and more energy beams. I dropped it after 132 episodes. I should have dropped it sooner, but I felt the show did have potential, but in the end it didn't reach it. The conclusion I have come to is that Kubo Tite (the creator and artist of Bleach) can draw very well, but when it comes to story telling, he fails miserabley. I wouldn't be surprised if he just made up the story as he goes along on the spot. My tip: give this anime / manga a miss and just watch something which is actually enjoyable. If it has to be Shounen, watch Hunter x Hunter or One Piece. I may have been brutal over this series, but it's just very overrated.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_809c82b2b7,1,2404
"I remember when I first got into Bleach. Young, stupid, inexperienced with anime. For quite a while I thought I was enjoying a nice school life supernatural with a cute shinigami girl living in the main character's closet. It had so much potential to become something that had some plot, deepened characters and some actual drama in the mix. Then came the soul society arc and for a while I accepted it as a part of the series. Then it mutated into a cash cow. Throwing away all traces of deep plot and developed characters. completely ignoring it's secondary characters and focusing on many others, one by one, with slow paced fights that take episodes to complete. after having watched +300 there hasn't been a moment where I heatedly laugh or emotionally tear up. There is absolutely nothing presented on the emotional level. It's cheap themes and an overload of characters, keeping it's fat behind on airing slots week after week making sure it milks itself for everything it's worth. Then to explain the entire plot and the 'why' of the story the plot has the nerve to blame everything on Aizen. (not a spoiler, it's freaking obvious) Although I want to cry when a character dies, or want to take a small break from this pointless so called 'action' between shallow characters with no development, or deep rivalry, to have some true humor or romance in between. There are just simply too many characters and just too little time and effort into truly turning them into real important figures and entities in the anime. I'll give you a million dollars if you can name every attack, move, sword name, and character name in the anime. Seriously who gives a f*ck? This is the equivalent of a bottle formula for the young anime viewer and is a decent start point for anime. It serves as the bottom step to take you to the next and the next as you ascend to the greatness of anime such as, Evangellion, Code Geass, CLANNAD, or something like that. I've seen single OVAs do more than the total 300+ episodes that Bleach has done. Honestly, reading the manga is barely enough to keep my attention span. why stick around for the extended version littered with fillers and band promotional EDs and OPs? It's just a money maker for the studios.I hope Yuki Matsuoka is getting her fair share of fame and salary out of this. Seiyuus and animators gotta eat too.That's the only thing I have to thank for the people who still watch this anime...",5,Mixed Feelings,"May 16, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b9f7ec9ddb,1,2435
"Ah good ol' Bleach, I started watching this when Naruto hit it's big filler phase and I fell in love with it. I suppose seeing as how this is a review I'll start out with what I love about the series. The characters are great with such a diverse range of people in the series, from the Captains of Gotei 13 to all of Ichigo's friends in his hometown; the series defienty has plenty of enjoyabe characters. The story itself, I think is great; I love animes that have to do with fighting supernatural being such as demons or ghosts or in this case Hollows. The series starts off a tad bit slow untill the first real arc begins in Soul Society, and from there I was hooked. The fight scenes are suberb and I love they shinigami weapons, called Zanpakutos and how they each have their own abilities and personalities. There is of course powered up forms reminiscent of plent of other shounen anime, but I actually like chaacters being able to turn into stronger forms. Ever since Dragonball Z's super saiyans; in the case of Bleach they release their swords, and then can go into Bankai form with some of the characters having even stronge forms. My only real gripe with this series is the fact that rarely anyone dies at all. Characters get stabbed, sliced, and put into near-death states but they always get healed or something, even villians. The villians are the only ones who seem able to actually die eventually, while all the good guys can get stabbed and whatever repeatedly and still fight like nothing happened. While this little gripe of mine does not deter from my overall enjoyment of the series, it can be a little annoying at times. They really need to allow some of the good guys to be killed, not main characters per-say, but atleast some of the secondary good guys every once in awhile just so we see they're not all invincible. All in all, I would easily reccommend this anime to any fans of action, or shounen in general because it is truly great.",9,Recommended,"Apr 28, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4f54da507d,1,1963
"Bleach is an anime that revolves around the japanese concept of having an orange haired person as the main character. While Kurosaki Ichigo's hair is indeed the main part of the plot , there is also a sub plot. Ichigo can see ghosts while not being drunk , one day his sisters are being attacked by a Hollow (an ancient japanese clown) - here we meet a new character , Rukia , whom while starting off as a decent character becomes as worthless as Sakura from Naruto . Rukia's hair is black , thus making her a side character -she tells Ichigo she is a shinigami which implies wearing black puffy pyjamas while fighting off clowns (Hollows). Because of how worthless she is, she gets beaten up by the hollow , so Ichigo - taking advantage of the situation - steals her powers to become the main character and gain power the like of which , the world have never seen the like of which. So then he saves his insignificant sister , whose names are not important enough to be stated. For letting Ichigo steal her powers , Rukia is pursued by her loving brother , Byakuya - chan , who wants to kill her . Here is a summary of the most important characters : Ishida - Wears glasses while not looking like a nerd which enables him to kill hollows using magical powers and good looks. His grandfather's father past is revealed in flashbacks , but since no one watches those , we can assume he is a toilet cleaner. Renji - Has some strange ass tatoos on his face , and is stupider than the averages british which puts him slighty higher than animals. Like all characters that love Rukia he wants to capture her so she can be killed. His sword's spirit looks like a baboon with a snake for a tail , this shows how much shit a japanese guy can come up with. Ichigo's friend #1 and #2 - They are not relevant in any way but knowing the author we can suppose they could be the actual evil masterminds. Chad - A mexican bulldozer that reassembles a human being , he has a mexican hair and mexican accent but he is not mexican. He is dumb but kind , which is usually the worst combination for an anime character. His grandfather (everyone appears to have one of those) is dead , he calls him 'abuelo' which I assume means 'asshole' in mexican. Orihime Inoue - Even though her hair is worthy of a main character , she is regrettably a female which means she is not macho enough to be the main character. She therefore assumes the role of support character , all she does is run around , get kidnapped , shout other's people's names (Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! Kurosaki-kun! ), have lame monologues and provide fanservice. Aizen - He is the Deus Ex Makina of Bleach , he is like Stephen Hawkings meets Jesus Chritst meets Gandalf. He is the most overpowered character ever invented , not even Voldermort would challenge him to a duel. Also his ego is about 2 times the size of the bleach universe. In terms that can be understood by the average anime fans , he is the male version of Haruhi Suzumiya except he doesn't have ponytails (in public) and his SOS squad (or as he calls it - Espada) is made up of hipsters. Tite Kubo , the manga-ka of Bleach , loves doing 3 things: 1.Overpower Aizen 2,Make dissapointing characters 3.Extend flash backs to a ridiculous extent The fight sequences consists of unnecessary movements and awkward punchlines. Here is the formula to calculate the chances of winning in bleach: how loud they scream (db) * how many flashbacks they had + how close they are to the main character (note : if formula applied to Aizen divide by 0) Also if badass music is playing around , you can pretty much assume something is going to happen , so get your popcorn ready for the bitch slapping - unless the enemy is Aizen , in which case not even badass music iwill help. The music itself consists of the vast playlist which sounds very much like the youtube sensation : Keyboard Cat. Every single male character in bleach is gay , with the exception of Kon - the teddy bear. This means that love plots are nonexistent thus the lack of love triangles (and love parallelograms). Another concept used in bleach is F.L.A.B.F. , which stand for Fucking Long And Boring Fillers. By using the ancient japanese technique of having a 10 years old write the plot , the Bleach fillers make as much sense as any given youtube comment. The fillers feature an intricate story consisting of shouting , running and bitching outloud , new characters are introduced to see whether a character more annoying than Inoue can be created - of course such abomination wasn't conceived yet. Many conspiracy theories have arised with regard to the making of those fillers , some claiming that the bleach studios are just trying to find out how much shit fans are willing to go through just to see Aizen getting beaten up (or go to the skies with his father , Jesus , and his granpa - Haruhi Suzumiya). Overall the cake is delicious , but would you really eat it if the pancakes were kidnapped? It's like the story of the lonely napkin who forgot to go to work and lost his passport in a volcano after being chased by a flying rabid weasel across the globe , while being followed by CIA for stealing a coin from the desk of the person who's brother is egyptian - the same place where the pharaohs ate stuff which reassembled delicious sterilized carbon otakoxide which reacts with bleachium hydromoe. I hope you enjoyed my analysis of this intricate bullshit , and will help me in my quest to work out how drunk I am right now.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_985ce3ca4b,1,5501
"Bleach really has a lot of ups and downs. While some parts of the anime are very catchy and enjoyable, others are incredible boring and make it hard to go on watching it. The very same goes to the plot of Bleach: There are some very interesting storyparts, as well as many plotholes and odds in the story (For example take a look at Soul Society - I'll never get why people grow up and die in a place they came to after they died on earth ...). The humour used in Bleach also has his ups and downs. Even though many jokes might not even scratch your lips, others will make you laugh hard enough to almost fall off your chair. The show always reaches his top when Ichigo is about to fight seriously, since those fight scenes are usually pretty cool, even though they are mostly kinda overdone. Bleach in general is a pretty enjoyable anime, especially the first few episodes are very entertaining and humorous. It's a shame it has some very boring story parts, many plotholes, many filler episodes and does not have much development in character relationships ... :(",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ec77a2e67d,1,1065
"I can't take this show anymore. I tried, I really did, but there's so many negative aspects to Bleach that I just can't watch this uninspired, bloated, one-track show. This is a prime example of action shonen titles gone wrong. STORY: There WAS a story. Something that started off pretty good in fact, until Tite Kubo topped himself with the first Soul Society arc. This part was enjoyable, Ichigo and his friend on a mission to rescue Rukia. Simple, yet effective, something you would expect from a typical shonen series. However it becomes very clear that little thought went into how to follow this storyline. Like Dragonball Z, which I reviewed eariler, once this arc of the show is complete, the rest just feels like padding and filler. I know that most of it is filler and it's a constant recurring theme with a lot of manga/anime tranisitions, but Bleach has derailed from it's original concept so far, it makes me wonder why the hell some things are still happening. Why is Ichigo still a substitute Soul Reaper? How in the hell is he able to achieve bankai if he's still alive? Why not just launch an all out assault on Hueco Mundo if they have time to send random captains and squads to earth just to dick around for 20 episodes? I thought the premise of the story was defeating hollows, performing a seiru on lost souls, and sending them whatever happened to that? Instead, they make up new forms of hollows, then upgrading them to arrancars, them to espadas, and then vizereds! And don't forget about the OTHER forms of hollows called hashucehs, or whatever! FAIL!!! ART: The art is good and detailed, but it's easy to forget that these are supposed to be high shcool students. There are way too many soul reapers and their designs ranged from generic to just flat-out scary. It doesn't help that they all have the exact same uniform, despite different ranks and squads. There's lots of squad jargon in this, so when you hear Rangiku scream ""Hang on, members of squad five and seven will be there for back-up"", just translate that into ""some generic red-shirts will be there!"" The villans all look completely ridiculous, especially the released form of arrancars and espadas. They look like failed Pokemon critters made out of petrified egg noodles. But still the art is still decent and some of the atmosphere looks nice, the battle scenes are vibrant and action-packed, so it does pass on that scale, as it's knows it's fans like action. SOUND: The english dub of this show is incredibly grating. If I wasn't hearing Johnny Yong Bosch snarling ""You Bastard"" every time someone does anything short asking him what the time is, it's listening to the terribly dubbed voices of the horrible excuse of comic relief this this show has to offer. They actually manage to make these ""personalities"" even more unfunny then they really are. The soundtrack is passable, but leaves no real impression on any scene thats taking place, except for the ""wacky comedy music""(jazz hands) to let you know that it's okay to laugh at whats going on right now. This show just insults me with how stupid it thinks I really am that I need phoned-in, whimsical music to remind me that jokes are being told. Focus on making the scene funny first, then get back to me. CHARACTER: Oh, you want personality and character development? No, not in Bleach. All character development must be presented in exposition flashbacks in order to save time for the next fight scene. Despite the diversity of characters in this anime, the males and females have limited traits that define whos who. Most of the guys are either boorish, loud and obnoxious, and most of the women are shrill, abrasive, and annoying. And I have to say, of all the shonen main characters I've watched over the years, I can't think of one thats as poorly written as Ichigo Kurosaki. There's no real direction as to what this character is supposed to be. In the beginning, he's supposed to be a delinquent, I guess, but I never quite believed it. He wants to fight to defend people, but treats his friends like shit, especially other male characters, to the point where I stopped caring about him. He's just another macho, male, chauvanistic, power craving Z Fighter knockoff who turns into a whiny emo git the second a stronger bad guy punches him around a few times, and if anyone like Byakyua or Kenpachi shows up, he has to try his best to assert his male dominance like an old lion getting kicked out of the pride. FAIL!!!!!! ENJOYMENT: There's just way too many uncalled for fight scenes in Bleach to stay interested. And once you start getting into character's bankais, the stupidity is cranked to the 32nd power. Characters get new powers out of nowhere with little explanation how they aquired them, the villians are nothing more than brutish thugs with petty grudges and don't do much else, the Soul Society is about as organized and efficient as your local Blockbuster and serves no real purpose other than a lame platform for the latest villian assault on it, a good chunk of the comedy is unoriginal and unfunny (short people jokes, hormone-driven jokes etc.), and is it me, or is this the desolate, lifeless version of Japan in anime history? It's giving Ronin Warriors a run for it's money. OVERALL: I just don't have the patience to sit through another +200 episode shonen title. Maybe if there was some sort of structure, or direction, it's just not good enough to deserve to be this long. Just because you can do it doesn't mean you should. But as long as it's marketable, Bleach, and titles alike will continue to go on and on, long past the point when it was fresh and different. Now it's just another shonen title, keeping the seat warm for the next big thing, like Naruto did for it.",4,Not Recommended,"Oct 19, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_997822223f,1,5752
"Im trying to write this review with minimum spoilers. . . . What makes a good anime ? Is it the art ? Is it the story ? We can say a lot of things but in my opinion, what makes an anime legendary is that if you watch it again and again without getting bored, you crave for it when you got nothing else to watch, that makes a great anime. Bleach makes you feel that way. I've read the manga too and its a solid 10 points for me. (Minimum amount of spoilers? below) . . . This will be my most controversial opinion yet; Bleach is the most under-rated anime ever made with how popular it is. It has a %45 filler rate and suffers from a classic shounen main protagonist style which can be seen as a bad thing but the story itself is far away from boring. It evolves with every arc and it's really enjoyable. The art is great (Kudos to Kubo ! we love you man) and the sound, the ost's... In my opinion it has one of the best ost's that anime history ever seen. The sad ost's will be make you cry even after listening to them after 10 years and remembering all the things that happened. While i write this review im listening to bleach ost's in the background and it takes me back to my childhood, the good times when there is no hardships adulthood has, no covid just pure happiness and the joy of watching anime and laughing with friends.

"I do not care what people on the internet say about Bleach. It is a total masterpiece and have wonderfull and epic episodes. I really hope that, they will adapt the final arc! It deserves to have a proper ending, it sad that the final arc has not been adapted to the anime. And the characters are awesome too. The animation is different and uniqe The voice actors for both the dub and sub are well chosen, they fit the characters perfectly It is one of my most favorite, if not my favortie anime. So yeah, that is my honest and true opinion of Bleach",10,Recommended,"Jan 24, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_70a26d929f,2,550
"I have been thinking of doing this review in the long time, and now I think it is time to do it, I have been the bleach fan for over 10 years and I am still going to be it until I died, for this I am going to tell about it, Bleach is my very first anime ever and I have watching many anime after that, but I couldn't find any similar anime as a bleach, bleach have something so special place in my heart, so I going to say what I am feeling about all of this though about bleach, For me bleach is the best manga and anime series of all time,(yes I know bleach have many fillers)(yes I know bleach when down after arrancar arc)(and yes I know the bleach ending was extremely rushed) but if you could take it on a side, bleach has been an unbelievable journey and adventure on every arc (including fillers) and the story is just a masterpiece, and the art is just amazing and wonderful in both manga and anime, Tite Kubo's art work is beautiful and amazing, never seen it on others manga series, I thinking Tite Kubo's working show us about everything, the story, the character, the soundtrack, everything of it, but the most important part he really show us is the power of human, as a very good example of Ichigo Kurosaki, ichigo has shows us the power of human in the reality, the strength, the pain, the emotional, the weakness, the protection, and the love, I see ichigo as my childhood hero of everything, he is not like the other character like, Goku, Naruto and Luffy, because those 3 have a goal in their life, ichigo doesn't have a goal, which is unlike from other character, but also ichigo doesn't wanna be the strongest in the world and he doesn't wanna be the best in the world, he just want something he can protect with and save people, he feels more like a real person than others or he is actually a human and the others doesn’t exist, but he's really goal is protect the people he love, he's goal is the way more humanity than the other 3. And the way ichigo is actually like real person is those moments, The way he's fighting against hollow ichigo, it is like he is fighting for himself, the hollow power ichigo had, is the weakness, the negative, the depressed, mental issues and the aggressive, the way ichigo fight for himself, the hollow power is ichigo biggest weakness, and he wants to surpass it with his human strength and his mentality, an another moment is when ichigo sacrificed his power against aizen, he wants ending the battle and save everyone, he sacrificed his power to protect everyone, and he actually did, he saved his friends and soul society, the soul society was he's enemies before, he became the hero of soul society, another moment the biggest one is when he said (the end of manga) what despair? because up till now, I've climbed up, kicked it in its teeth and... surpassed it over and over again just to make it to this very moment!! That is the biggest moment of entire bleach, think about it, when he got the power for the first time, he's have problem, he's have weakness, he couldn't control it, and he couldn't surpass it, when he said that line, it really shows us, how strong he become, how he's surpass of everything, how he overcome all weakness, and no matter how many times he lost, get injured, get aggressive, get depressed, he still wanna fight to the end, and it is not about he's power but about he's humanity, how he grow up to a teenager who doesn’t want the power at first and didn’t care about save the strangers, to the person who want to save many people as in possibly, since the first chapter to last chapter ichigo has growing up so much, about his character development, his personality, his mentality and his humanity, because I feeling every time when Ichigo is fighting, he fights for everyone, not just in anime world, but in our world as well, Ichigo and Bleach has shown us the happiness, the sadness, the emotional and the adventure, and I hope you can see as well, I started to watching bleach when I was 10 years old and now I am 23, I am still going to be bleach fan until I died ^^ I know bleach is not for everyone but I hope you are going to watch it one day And for the bleach fan out there I hope this review is something meaningful to you Bleach is the most important anime for me because bleach has learning me many things, and bleach is the series that changes my life to become manga and anime fan, and I am proud to be a bleach fan ^^ thank you Tite Kubo for create bleach and to change my life <3 ^^",10,Recommended,"Jul 26, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_27f5e8c20a,2,4494
"Bleach, you were once considered by the anime community to be one of the greatest shows of all-time. Now you're considered one of the worst. Let me start out by saying, this was my gateway anime, and it's what got me actively into anime 4 years ago. Despite its flaws, I still love this series, but not as much as I used to for many reasons which I'll get to in a bit. Bleach is about a high school student named Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see the spirits of the dead, and later encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper (Or Shinigami as it is in the fansubs) who helps send the deeply departed to the Soul Society, and slays Hallows to do that as well. She later ends up having to give him her powers in order for him to protect his family. However this is a grave crime in the Soul Society, and Rukia is later taken back where she is waiting execution for her crime. Ichigo and his friends of course then go to save her, and later many in the Soul Society also find corruption, and conspiracies in their system. This is where Bleach was at its best, the Substitute arc (1-20) and the Soul Society arc (21-63) are what made Bleach so successful in the first place. You had such an action-packed story, with deep elements, and good character development. You could have almost considered the show a masterpiece with what took place in episodes 1-65. Then from there, it went downhill. The first of the filler arcs began, the Bount arc which personally I find to be the best out of all the filler arcs. Speaking of filler, about half the show is filler. This is all due to Tite Kubo's complete inability to pace, period. Manga readers know full well he doesn't know how to pace. He draws such large of panels, and puts in hardly dialogue (And backgrounds-""Backgrounds in my Bleach?""), it's no wonder why a single episode will cover 3-5 chapters, causing them to catch-up to the manga very often, leading to all that filler. Now back to where it went wrong, Bleach began to fall apart after the Soul Society arc beginning with the first filler arc, the Bount. The Bount arc did have its fair share of good points (Like going into the extermination of the Bounts, and what they had gone through because of the Soul Society), but it was a letdown at times due to the poor pacing (Yes, even filler had bad pacing, go figure...), plot holes, and the lack of explanations to certain things that need explaining. The other arcs later suffered from these same issues (and from a few Dues Ex Machinas), and the character department began to suffer as well. The arc that had the most issues was the infamous Hueco Mundo arc which dragged on and on, and is by far the longest arc in Bleach. This is where Bleach's success began to wane. The TV ratings became shit to the point later on it led to the show getting cancelled after the Fullbring arc, people were dropping this series left and right, it lost its ""Big 3"" status (Note: If you still believe Bleach is ""Big 3"", you're either ignorant or behind the times) and more. The characters of Bleach are what the fans love the most about the show. Many have such cheesy personalities, deep backstories, and the usual desire to protect someone. However one character that really stands out as being bad is Orihime. You cannot turn a blind eye to her. After the Soul Society arc, she becomes almost completely useless (The only use she really ends up having aside from that minor support for her friends is healing people), whines a lot (Ex: ""Kurosaki-kun!!!!!""-Oh look we ripped off InuYasha, not just YuYu Hakusho (Spirit detective) and Hunter x Hunter (Clan extermination, you being the only one left-Uryu-and wanting revenge against who did it)...) which is the reason why so many people cannot stand her), and has her development go completely backwards as she becomes a damsel in distress, and willingly no less. The others will suffer from the same issues at times. For example Ichigo changes as he realizes he's not able to really protect what he loves most, but then will go backwards back to where he was at times by being scared of his own power. He'll also keep being the blind idiot that'll charge towards every opponent without ever really thinking things through. Now's not to say the show doesn't have any good points after it goes downhill. For example, you still have the desire to protect, an intricate plot with Aizen and what he was planning to do with the Hogyoku, what does it mean to be human, and the issues of exterminating something you created. But with Bleach's many issues after the Soul Society arc, it fails to ever be as good as it once was. It's a shell of its former self. The storytelling issues just leave you scratching your head at times, causing you to not be as deeply involved with the show as you once were, the characters having messy development also causes the same issue, and more. This is where you find yourself not loving it as much as you did. The art and animation comes from Studio Pierrot, who does not do a very good job with what they do with production values, even today, but this is where they did it that best. The artwork looks rather nice, and it's not the typical art you'd find from your average Shonen. The animation can be awkward at times (Especially during fights, and running scenes), but it can be rather nice. The sound is just good, the characters have good voice actors (Both sub and dub), and the background music fits in with almost every scene, but some tracks leave much to be desired. Bleach in the end is a show that started out truly great, but later went downhill, and became a shell of what it once was. It's still very good (Barely, just barely), but not the near-masterpiece it once was.",8,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ad8be0bee3,2,5703
"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything bragworthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsical of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbreat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to melliflous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and endign themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, desptie what Narutard, shonen haters or anyone else have said. It's pretty enjoyable despite its lacks and faults, mostly in thanks to its great cast. Overall 10 😎😎😎😂😂😂",10,Recommended,"Aug 1, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_55b66131a1,2,5514
"So, Bleach. Or like we fans like to call it; Blah, Plotkai, The Troller's Guide to the Fandom, Rinse. Story: Bleach story is really big challenge to average guys brain. It's like big chess game full of free moves. You never know what is going to happen or which chessman is going to be moved next. Only tiny little thing on this chess game is that last movement was made back in 2002 like 9 years ago. After 9 years Kubo hasn't managed to move a single chessman to anywhere. Actually the story is really great. Too bad same things happens 42 times with different characters or with different power levels. After reading almost 500 chapters of the manga I can tell biggest plot twist is just behind 460 chapters when Rukia has new haircut. I know, I totally spoiled the whole thing. I've also heard 42 is the amount of seconds it took Kubo to write the story, too bad he didn't have enough time to come up with plot. Characters: Yes, there is a lot of those. Really great ones, like Inoue Orihime. Lets just say if Yagami Light knew her, her name would be written really quickly. Bleach has also made character development to whole new level; I didn't know it could be negative. Art: At the beginning, there was one. It was messy and reader didn't always get what was happening. So it got fix'd and turned into ""lines."" No ink is wasted anymore. You can really see how white those manga sides are before they are filled with things.. And after that too. Bleached, ha, I bet no-one has heard that before. In the anime it's just shit along the animation. But hey, it's still definitely the strongest part of this series. Enjoyment: Oh yes. If you see a guy who isn't moving anywhere but spinning at his place and says he is going home - that's quality entertainment. How about Bleach. Well, it's like that guy but all he does is say he is going home. After many years it gets little annoying. My score was 10 for long time after the start. After that it has keep coming down little by little just like the story has improved. It's now 3. I'm looking forward to the future. :) Suggestion list: Forks, yes forks. Those are fascinating.

"One problem I noticed is people giving notes based on what others have said, without saying what they thought of such a subject. With the animes the same things, of course there will always be someone who will hate something, there is no ''perfection''. To be honest the first 4 episodes made me drop the anime, but after reviewing dragon ball, I decided to give this one a chance. (It was anime that made me see the otakus differently). In the end I did not stop, I finished in 3 or 4 weeks or so. Well, knowing that, let's go to what I found. History NOTE: 10 Ichigo, (the protagonist) has the ability to see spirits. One night, he meets a reaper named Rukia, she is impressed by his ability to see her, but in the midst of it all, a Hollow appears an ugly and evil beast. She decides to transfer some of her power to him, and without Rukia knowing that Ichigo is badass the fight ends on time. Well, in the end, Ichigo took all her power, being a big problem for her, because no Shinigami/Reaper can hand over power to someone else. Good rest need not add, it's already a good summary ... Oh, in my view I really liked the added things, some bad fillers of course... but nothing that demerits the anime itself. Art NOTE: 10 The fights, my God! They're fantastic, and since I don't quite understand this, I'm going to give you the top score! The expressions weren't great, I think it's as much as I can get as someone who doesn't understand about anime art. Sound NOTE: 10 All openings, and endings. Amazing! Fantastic Japanese and Brazilian voice overs! (Very sad for the discontinuation of Brazilian voice acting) :( Characters NOTE: 10 Ichigo is my favorite character, I love everyone else, hard to tell who I hate... Entertainment NOTE: 10 Good for a large majority who love shounen, this anime must conquer. I, for one, love the style. And of course there's going to be people who ooper it, but then that's other talk. I hope you've been helpful in my analysis. Could it have been exaggeration I given a 10 at all? Well, that's just my opinion. :) Um problema que notei é as pessoas darem notas baseadas no que os outros falaram, sem dizer o que acharam de tal assunto. Com os animes as mesmas coisas, é claro que sempre vai ter alguém que vai odiar algo, não existe ''perfeição''. Pra ser sincero os 4 primeiros episódios me fizeram largar o anime, mas depois de rever dragon ball, eu resolvi dar uma chance para esse. (Foi o ANIME que me fez ver os otakus de maneira diferente). No final das contas eu não parei, terminei em 3 ou 4 semanas mais ou menos. Bom, sabendo disso vamos para o que ''eu achei''. História NOTA: 10 Ichigo, (o protagonista) tem a capacidade de ver espíritos. Em uma noite, ele se encontra com uma ceifadora chamada Rukia, ela se impressiona com a habilidade dele de vê-la, mas no meio disso tudo, aparece um Hollow um bicho feio e do mal. Ela resolve transferir um pouco de seu poder a ele, e sem Rukia saber que o Ichigo é fodão a luta acaba na hora. Bom, no final das contas, Ichigo pegou todo o poder dela, sendo um problemão pra ela, pois nenhum Shinigami/Ceifador pode entregar o poder para outra pessoa. Bom de resto não precisa acrescentar, já é um bom resumo... Ah, no meu ponto de vista gostei muito das coisas acrescentadas, alguns fillers ruins é claro... mas nada que desmereça o anime em si. Arte NOTA: 10 As lutas, meu deus! São fantásticas, e como não entendo direito disso vou dar a nota máxima! As expressões não eram grande coisas, acho que é o máximo que posso chegar como alguém que não entende sobre arte de animes. Som NOTA: 10 Todas as aberturas, e finais. Incríveis! Dublagens tanto japonesa, como brasileira fantásticas! (Muito triste pela descontinuação das dublagens brasileiras) :( Personagens NOTA: 10 Ichigo é meu personagem favorito, amo todos os outros, difícil dizer quem eu odeio... Entretenimento NOTA: 10 Bom para uma grande maioria que ama shounen, esse anime deve conquistar. Eu, por exemplo amo o estilo. E claro que vai ter gente odiando, mas aí já é outros papo. Espero que tenha sido útil á minha analise. Pode ter sido exagero eu dado nota 10 em tudo? Bom, isso é apenas minha opinião. :) Translation done on bing, lazy to put into English.

Bleach is one of the best anime to ever exist. its a 10/10 people down play it because they dont understand the characters at all. most of them are sheep if you disagree just say your biased and explain.The first arc is one of the best new arcs with grand fish vs ichigo coward vs pride. it also shows a lot of foreshadowing like the quincy symbol on ichigo bed and also ichigo absorbing more reistu which are all foreshadows. Then the SS arc shows the best of ichigo titainism vs byuakuya legalism. then the next arc which i think is the best arc which grimmjow vs ichigo shows nature vs nurture and also him accepting himself as a hollow in the fight which then he showed his full power because he wasent scared about what other people think. people are blind or the just dont really watch the show if they didnt know that and that isnt plot amour at all. Ulq vs ichigo is also not plot white told ichigo that and also chapter 217 is foreshadowing his hollow in the fight. it shows how ulq starts to realize what a heart is and he starts to value human life more and become non nihilistic while ichigo started to become nihilistic its a complete switch. Aizen vs Ichigo has a lot of stuff which one of the best is the religious part of the moon in Buddhism which aizen search for enlightenment and koyoka suigetsu translates to the moon then ichigo sword zangetsu translate to moon cuter showing him cutting down false enlightenment and aizen goal was to dethrone the soul king (god) and ichigo being ever race soul reaper hollow full bringer and quincy is him being closest to the soul king which aizen wanted to be above then got cut down by him. Then the fullbringe arc which people think is just some arc to give the mc there power back which it isnt ginjo represents alot of stuff which one of those is revenge on the corrupt soul society for manipulating and lying to him which also happened to ichigo with the soul society and he did that exact same thing showing his hypocrisy.Then it shows his titanism as he wants revenge to the soul society and wants revolt in their systemic oppression.This arc wasent some arc for ichigo to get his powerse this arc is shown what its like for him to not have any powers and it shows his savior complex alot and shows is hypocrisy. Ichigo vs ulq he shown not to want to kill him because its not noble or heroic and it doesnt mater to him but now he was pushed so fair he wanted to kill someone which is also showing his development in character.More and more into the show ichigo has became to realize that him and his sword are one which he didnt accept it. When ichigo is given his sword back when yhwach destroyed it he doesnt use bankai because he has realize what his sword has done and was grateful fpr what his sword has done. Yhwach is also represented by some people like jesus which him being son of god (soul king) and also being born in poor conditions like him not having his 5 senses and he was able to perform miracles which also sets up a dynamic between him and aizen (devil) which some are him stating the soul society belongs to him which in the bible it says that earth belongs to the devil. the arrow that was used to kill yhwach wasnt a bad ending and it was foreshadowed in 659 when he was cutting his wife open when she died of the Auswhalen.

"Bleach is an outstanding anime. From the moment you watch it, you're left wanting to know what happens next. The action is intense, and there is plenty of humor. I'm going to break down the scoring into the categories and elaborate on why it was given that score. Story: 9 The story is very gripping. It has many plot twists, and is full of surprises. Ichigo has been able to see ghosts since he was little. When a hollow comes (an evil spirit) a shinigami named Rukia shows up in Ichigo's room trying to figure out where it is. She is startled that Ichigo can see her, since normal humans can't. Annoyed by his attitude, she places a binding spell on him. The hollow shows up, and it's targeting Ichigo's family. This causes Ichigo to break the binding spell, who runs down to help his family, while Rukia is left shocked. As Ichigo is fighting the hollow, Rukia steps in and saves him, though she gets injured in the process. Ichigo, desperate to protect his family, has Rukia transfer her shinigami powers to him, but unexpectedly takes all of them instead of half. Ichigo eventually agrees to take Rukia's place for a while, and Rukia starts discovering that he's not an ordinary shinigami. Just what is he? Art: 10 The art is beautiful. The characters are drawn with defining styles, giving each character their own personality as soon as you see them. The battles are where the art really shines though. The weapons look awesome, some of which are swords, others are spirit bows. Lastly, the scenery is amazingly well drawn. Everything is very detailed and really stands out.

"Every couple of months my rating for this anime drops. A couple of years ago I thought this anime was awesome but now its just empty space. This anime is just a time waster. It has taken 310 episodes to complete the story (if it really is completed). That is simply way too long. This entire series is just a giant tease. The battles that are boring and involve no one particularly interesting last 5 episodes. And the really epic battles that the entire series builds up to last 1. Not to mention the ridiculous amount of filler. Also the story makes no sense whatsoever. There are so many illogical characters (hinamori!) and lose ends that I just threw my hands up and gave up. My advice is: 1. If you haven't already started watching this anime, wait 4-50 years for it to end so you can skip all of the filler episodes or just watch recap episodes. 2. If you already are watching this anime, follow step one. You have probably already wasted several days of your life watching bleach.

"When talking about BLEACH there's always a heated debate going on. People who have watched the show complain about many things, from the character development, to the matter of the fillers, to the lack of necessary explanation for certain events and lots more... I admit some to be legitimate, but there are some other issues that may be caused by various sorts of misunderstandings. For instance, some people complain about the numerous fillers that break the original story line; I rather think they are necessary, since a long run show like this needs to be split, otherwise it would be too much to handle. Fillers are fun (I said what I said ;)), and a great way to feel less overwhelmed by the heavy and thick plot. Obviously I am talking as someone who watched it during the last year all at once, people who watched it while it was airing have all reason to complain. Then since we are talking about a thick plot, it is true that some situations, events and systems are not well explained, as well as some characters' backgrounds, and it's kind of frustrating, because everything else is so great that you just miss that one little piece to make it perfect. Needless to say that this happens because there are just too many characters, too many stories, too many details squished in one single show. Thing is, it doesn't matter how annoyed you are by this chaotic system, you will fall in love with those details, that big bunch of characters, those complex arcs, ending up wanting those 366 episodes to never end; because basically, besides their abundance, all these features are iconic: amusing characters, no plot holes, A LOT OF PLOTWISTS, great fights, amazing soundtrack and themes and so on. BLEACH became quickly one of my favourites, despite not being flawless, it kept me in suspense, made me laugh, also cry sometimes, it always got me hoping to see more, and if it made me feel all that, it means that (at least to me) it is a piece of work worth of recognition.",10,Recommended,"Aug 15, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4cab2f458b,2,1982
"Have the patients to watch this god tier anime, if you dont you wont enjoy it plain and simple. Its OST is one of the best in anime, fights are rewarding for the most part, art is awesome but i disliked how they changed the artstyle but that tends to happen after long time, story is unique and fun and easy to follow. All in all great anime for those who love shonen. Personally the dub is what made me love it but the sub seemed alright too. I rewatched it and skipped the filler the second time and i had a better experience the second time around, but there are at times where filler characters mix with canon which can be strange and annoying but not that much. There is only 1 scene where a filler character is added into a serious scene so you dont have to worry. All in all great anime and when i have the time i would love to rewatch it again",10,Recommended,"Mar 17, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c648c52c09,2,851
"Bleach is one of my favorite anime. The story in the anime is great. I have nothing to say about sound, perfection. In my opinion Bleach has the best artistic style of the big 3. The characters are very well designed, especially Aizen, Urahara and Ulquiorra. Urahara is my favorite character because he reminds me of me xD. Some characters have a hole in the story, the only thing I don't like is that. I enjoyed watching Bleach, the fights and everything else is great. I recommend Bleach to everyone who hasn't watched it, you can skip the fillers, although there are also good fillers. I can’t wait for the Thousand-Year Blood War arc to be animated, I hope it will be this year. Overall 10/10.",10,Recommended,"Jul 7, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2831f7c99b,2,697
"I feel like this anime should be boken up into different seasons or story arcs. The rating I gave if is for the animes original story arc. The first story arc (the Soul Society Story Arc) was the greatest anime experience of my entire life. The story is exciting, and envokes every emotion in the the viewer. The chracters are very well done and diverse. I found myself picking a new favorite character every few episodes! Bleach even has an awesome soundtrack! This portion of Bleach gets a 10 out of 10 hands down. Everything after the Soul Society Story Arc doesn't even compare. The filler is as bad, if not worse than the Naruto filler, and is very hard to get through. Within the filler there is the: Bount Story Arc, and then just a bunch of misselaneous eppisodes that are not connected in any way. The Bount Story Arc is not very good, and the miscelaneous filler that follows is unbearable. I would honestly rate this portion of the anime a 2 out of 10. The Espada Story Arc follows the filler, and is pretty good, however still does not impact you the way the first story arc did. It is very worth watching though, since there are some good battles and a variety of interesting new characters. The new characters are harder to identify with than the characters from the earlier story arc, However it is always fun to watch the anime's main characters continue to grow. All in all I would rate this portion of the anime about a 7.5 out of 10. After the Espada Story Arc, the anime moves into more filler, and after about 3 episodes I gave up on it. The important thing to take from this is that episodes aprox. 12 to 62 are amazing, and I would recomend everyone watch from episode 1 to 62. Hope this review is helpful :)",10,Recommended,"Jul 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e3f135495f,2,1731
"This is my first review, so please forgive me for my errors. Where do I begin with this show huh? First off I want to start by saying that this show is damn near flawless. I say damn near flawless even though I'm giving this show a 10 excluding the fillers with some being an exception. This show is both a popular Shonen and at the same time I feel like it's criminally underrated. Me speaking as a massive bleach fan who's been drinking bleach for 2 years, like others we consider this show to be the worst of the big three. Ngl this show is my favorite of the big three Shinigami Arc, Some people like me consider this the worst arc in the bleach anime but I don't think this arc wasn't that bad. Ichigo is just your average teenage student school in high school born with a power to see ghosts. Rukia shows up and hands ichigo her soul reaper powers and Ichigo vows to protect his friends and family. Later on we get to know about the likes of uryu, orihime, and chad as the arc progresses. Rukia eventually forces herself to get captured by her childhood friend renji and her brother byakuya for the crimes of giving a human soul reaper abilities, and of course it's up to ichigo and his friends to save her from being executed after their training with kisuke. Soul Society Arc: Honestly as much as I kinda get annoyed this take that people like to say when it comes to this show, I do think that the Soul Society Arc is the best arc and one of the best arcs in Shonen. I say that because everytime I come across a take about this show, they say that ""Bleach falls off after soul society"" or ""Bleach takes a nosedive after the first 63 episodes."" I find those kind of takes very delusional. So during this arc, Ichigo learns how to maintain his soul reaper powers as he meets yoruichi and makes contact with his sword spirit zangetsu. The karakura gang rushes to the Soul society on their way to save rukia. In order to do that, they must encounter countless shinigami including the captains and lieutenants. A huge plot twist gets revealed during this arc that no one expected was gonna happen. Arrancar Arc: Like I said I find this take delusional as I see many people even on this site say this show falls off after ichigo saves rukia. I do kind of see it but I still disagree nonetheless. If you want to say because of the fillers ruin the pacing of this show then sure. LIsten no one is forcing you to watch the garbage known as the bount and the new captain arc. I'll admit I did make the mistake of watching those bs fillers myself thinking they were canon because I personally never heard of fillers. That's my only bad thing I'll say about this show. However I do think the second half of the filler arcs are better and even the animation I found to way better most of the time than the mainline story arcs as crazy as that sounds. We start off the arc with ichigo and friends returning to their high school days until ichigo encounters with shinji, who just like ichigo is a soul reaper has a strange hollow mask that grants him hollow powers. Shinji wants ichigo to join his vizard crew to train him on how to master his hollow powers. After that we get introduced to these new level of hollows called arrancars, who are basically hollows that look like humans and they also have swords. So pretty much they're soul reaper captain level. As the arc goes on Ichigo learns to control his hollow powers as he continues to fight to save his friends. Fullbring Arc: This arc is very controversial because of it taking place after ichigo defeats Aizen, the main antagonist of Bleach and people consider it canon filler. Personally while it isn't one pf my favorite arcs in the show, I still enjoyed it nonetheless. After ichigo loses his soul reaper powers from his battle with aizen, he spends his normal life as a high school student as a full year flows by. Out of nowhere a fullbringer name ginjo see ichigo and tells him that he'll be able to get his powers back if he joins his crew of fullbrings, who are basically regular humans who uses normal objects to release out their soul abilities. Conclusion: This is honestly my second favorite anime of all time behind dragon ball (mainly Z). Tite Kubo's character art style is my favorite of any anime I've seen. The art style in the manga is better but the anime version is still great. I will do a review on the first and second cour of the new thousand year blood war anime. Like I said it's not a perfect show despite me giving it a high score but my biggest reason of liking the hell out of this show is because of it's drip and it's fights. I do like the story as well. Kubo is known to have the most sauciest characters in anime. I will forever drink bleach until the ends of the earth.",10,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7f8b1b288,2,4757
"During the 2000s there were three anime that stood tall above the rest at that time. The anime that brought an entire generation of anime watchers into anime. Of course, I am referring to the big three: Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece. While I personally got into anime through other means, Bleach still means a lot to me as a series. I have so much nostalgia looking back on it, that it's hard to imagine life without watching the series. So now, let's get this review on. Characters: Bleach characters are always interesting to talk about, because there's just so many of them. That can be seen as a flaw, because sometimes too many characters can cause it to become cluttered and then the story becomes hard to follow, or the characters lack any sense of depth. That being said, I think Bleach pulls it off. Every character has distinct personalities, and almost every character has well thought out connections with someone else throughout the story, whether important to the plot or not. Take Rangiku, a character that is basically just in the background, and is seen as a simple big titty anime girl. She actually has a vital connection to one of the most important characters during a specific arc. That just goes to show how much time and thought was put into the characters. As a main character, Ichigo is that guy. He's the man who shows up, ready to have your damn back in any situation. His transformations are some of the best shounen has to offer, and his characterization and self-discovery journey are beautiful. His relationship with all of his friends, especially Rukia, are dynamic and interesting. There is so much to talk about with the characters, but I'd like to keep it spoiler free, so I'll stop there. Soundtrack: Shiro Sagisu knows how to write music. The Bleach soundtrack is my favorite in anime, no questions asked. Tracks like: Treachery, Number One, Shinji's Theme, La Espada, Never Meant to Belong, Stay with me, and so so many more go so hard. Animation: Considering how old it is, the animation can get choppy at times, however it's not unappealing to look at by any means. That being said, it could be better. Overall: I didn't talk about too much because I didn't want to get into spoilers, however I have to recommend it to anyone willing to skip filler. (Please don't watch the filler, it's really fucking bad). The story is actually really well thought out, and it's worth the watch.",9,Recommended,"Oct 23, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fe1ad9b1f1,2,2421
"This anim&eacute; would easily be a 10 if the plot were condensed into between 1/2 and 2/3 of the episodes. The Bounto arc wasn't even present in the manga and is not generally worth watching/doesn't affect character development either. (I think that's around episode 70-100 or so) This anim&eacute; is not bad to watch many episodes of back-to-back because you don't notice the stretched out pacing of it as much, watching weekly is almost tortuous, especially when there are random 2-3 week breaks once in a while. I'd almost recommend for anyone wanting to keep up-to-date, but who hates slow paced stuff to just watch groups of 2 months worth of episodes at a time, or something like that. Yeah, it's your typical fight anim&eacute; and it can drag on, but you'll never get anything as bad as the Frieza Saga IMO. ;)",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_02b599758a,2,820
"First time I watched Bleach was when I was a kid. I thought the Agent of the Shinigami Arc & the Soul Society Arc were great but when I got to the horribly boring Bount Arc it was soo boring that I droped the anime. When 2020 came I decided to revisit my childhood animes. I rewatched Naruto, Fairy Tail, Doraemon, Shinchan, Perman & Bleach. I was still a newbie back then and didn't know about filler. I again droped Bleach because of the bount arc. Then again in early 2023 for the 3rd & last time I decided to watch Bleach but this time I knew what filler was so I skipped the bount arc and went straight to the Arrancar Saga and it was a masterpiece. Then I watched the The Lost Substitute Shinigami Arc which was also great. afterwards I watched The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc Part 1 and it was great. After taking the story telling, the plot twist, the arcs, the action, the comedy, the art, the side characters, the protagonist, the antagonists, the duogonist & the world building into concideration I rated it a 9.7 out 0f 10. It's my favorite anime (after Steins;Gate which is a 10 out of 10 Ofcourse) for all this reasons.

"Ah yes, I finally got around to finishing off Bleach. Man, this animé was a wild ride, let me tell you. I'll give a review on each of the characteristics I found in Bleach below for anyone interested. → Story: The story starts off with a young high-schooler named Ichigo Kurosaki who is gifted with the ability to see ghosts, spirits, and the like. One day, his family is attacked by something known as a Hollow, which are essentially evil spirits that try to consume human souls. He is then saved by Rukia Kuchiki, the tsundere Soul Reaper, which are essentially spirit hunters that try to purify Hollows to enter the Seiretei (basically heaven). Having been brutally injured in battle, Rukia asks Ichigo to take over for her and become a Soul Reaper himself, which Ichigo accepts, to then protect his family and friends. The story goes on like that for a while, with it having one of the best arcs ever, the Soul Society arc. In this arc, Ichigo and friends try to rescue Rukia, who is slated to be executed for donating her powers to Ichigo. Here, Ichigo and friends must fight through a hoard of Captain-class Soul Reapers that are impeding their rescue operation to get to Rukia, after which the plot thickens, traitors are uncovered, and the story escalates into something far more sinister as friends turn out to be enemies and enemies turn out to be friends? You never know who you can trust and who you can't, which is something Bleach did a phenomenal job of doing. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. The only issue with the story portion of Bleach was its vast amount of filler episodes, but you can easily skip over those if you don't want to watch them. Otherwise, the story was very strong and I enjoyed all of it. I won't dock points for filler episodes, so the story of Bleach is a solid 10 out of 10. → Characters: Bleach has a phenomenal roster of characters. Some of them are annoying (Keigo Asano, Orihime Inoue, Hiyori Sarugaki, etc) while others are good (Shunsui Kyoraku, Jushiro Ukitake, Kisuke Urahara, etc). Bleach has no shortage of characters so you're bound to find someone you like or resonate the most with. The only issue is that Ichigo's friends kind of become too weak to do anything in battle as the series progresses (rip Uryu Ishida), but I guess that's standard for a shonen animé, where they have to make the main character (Ichigo) overpowered to where the other cast can't compete. I give Bleach's characters a solid 10 out of 10. → Art and Animation: I think the animators did great for the animations and fight scenes. The Bankai that we're shown are also very well done and executed. In addition, you're always seeing a different background, be it daytime or nighttime. The scenery is always different with every episode, plus the characters were very well-drawn and well animated. Easily a 10 out of 10 here. I had no issues with the art or animation, honestly. → Sound and Music: Bleach has some killer openings and I have most of them on my playlist, but that aside, the music that plays during each tense moment, or battle, really has you on pins and needles as to what you expect to happen next. It really can give you chills and goosebumps at times and I think that's where the music is best, where it helps you essentially feel like you're in the Bleach universe. Bleach's music is honestly fire and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're missing out if you haven't. The sound and music are also an easy 10 out of 10 for me. → Conclusion: Overall, I think Bleach is a really solid animé. Granted, there's some annoying characters included in it but it didn't take away from the fact that the animé in general was still a good watch and made me want to keep coming back for more with the conclusion of each episode. I can't wait to start binging the Thousand Year Blood War arc and I'm just waiting for that arc to become fully dubbed because of how good Bleach was. If you're looking for a Shonen anime to watch and you're not sure what to watch, I do recommend picking up Bleach if you haven't already. It's one of the ""Big Three"" for a reason next to Naruto and One Piece and I stand by that decision. I rate Bleach a solid 10 out of 10 animé in the end.",10,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_04448e2859,3,4234
"Bleach is a amazing story about boy and the many friends and enemies he makes along the way. This anime has action, adventure, and comedy all merged into one to make it worth watching. When I first watched Bleach I was pulled into it by the area of supernatural that surrounded it. Another reason why I like Bleach so much is that the characters were admirable especially Ichigo Kurosaki. His determination was inspiring and had me coming back for more not to mention the great deal of sword fighting that went along with it. The music, and art were outstanding its not too sketchy and overall its easy on the eyes.

"Don't let that question mark fool you like it did me, this anime is well over a hundred episodes long. At first I thought, ""Hey this seems to be around 13 episodes long due to it being episodic."" Boy was I wrong. This show drags out in a way that makes you sick inside. As it goes further in, it makes less and less sense. The main character Ichigo, loses a fight. So he powers up, has another sword fight and wins. Which I think is the plot to DBZ, just without the swords. It's beyond me how any of these characters retain their mental sanity. If I was pulled into another dimension where I have to fight endless amounts of zombies, (they aren't alive so technically they are zombies) I'd start freaking out. The more he fights the more dull it feels, like it loses it's meaning. So they took your girlfirend who lives in your closet for a month, that's no reason to go to the depths of hell to stop them from killing her. Like what? But it never stops getting weird and awkward. In my opinion it's in your best interest, just don't watch this anime. I'm only trying to help you out.

"Title: Bleach - A Shonen Epic Blending Battles, Redemption, and Identity Rating: 9/10 Introduction: ""Bleach"" has long held its place as a quintessential entry in the world of shonen anime. Based on Tite Kubo's celebrated manga, it seamlessly intertwines high-stakes battles, intricate world-building, and compelling character development, all wrapped within a narrative brimming with themes of redemption, identity, and friendship. As an ardent anime enthusiast, I offer an in-depth review of ""Bleach,"" demonstrating why it undeniably merits a solid 9/10 rating. Engaging Storyline and World-Building: At the core of ""Bleach"" is a narrative that seamlessly fuses captivating storytelling with world-building. It commences with Ichigo Kurosaki, an ordinary teenager whose life takes a dramatic turn when he gains the abilities of a Soul Reaper, a celestial being entrusted with preserving the balance between the living and the afterlife. His odyssey, which transcends realms encompassing the living world, the Soul Society, and Hueco Mundo, unfurls a rich tapestry of supernatural battles, mysteries, and profound revelations. The world-building in ""Bleach"" is nothing short of exemplary. It ensnares the viewer in a dynamic universe where the lines demarcating the human and spirit worlds become increasingly blurred, opening up boundless opportunities for storytelling. Each arc of the series brings a new facet of this multifaceted world to the forefront, deepening our understanding of its intricacies and magic. Diverse and Memorable Characters: A distinguishing hallmark of ""Bleach"" is its extensive and unforgettable roster of characters. Ichigo Kurosaki, the protagonist, embarks on a journey of extraordinary growth, evolving from an ordinary teenager into a formidable Soul Reaper. His character arc is punctuated by moments of introspection, unwavering determination, and self-discovery. Equally noteworthy are the vibrant supporting characters, each distinguished by their unique abilities, personalities, and intricate backstories. Renji Abarai, Rukia Kuchiki, Uryu Ishida, and a plethora of others contribute to the intricate narrative tapestry. Their diverse personas and emotional depth form an indelible impression on viewers, magnifying their emotional investment in the series. Themes of Redemption and Identity: ""Bleach"" plunges headlong into the profound and multifaceted themes of redemption and identity. Countless characters, including some of the most formidable adversaries, carry the weight of complex pasts and internal struggles that govern their actions. Ichigo Kurosaki's steadfast resolve to safeguard both the living and the departed mirrors an ardent quest for redemption. His internal conflicts, stemming from his own past and experiences, add depth to his character and challenge viewers to contemplate the complexities of human nature. In its exploration of the ramifications of one's actions, ""Bleach"" undertakes an unwavering examination of the possibility of securing forgiveness and the potential for self-redemption. These themes impart an additional layer of emotional depth to the numerous battles and character interactions throughout the series. Epic Battles and Spectacular Animation: ""Bleach"" has earned its reputation for delivering epic battles that are nothing short of spectacular. The intricately designed zanpakuto (spiritual weapons) and a broad spectrum of unique fighting styles contribute to exhilarating and visually impressive combat sequences.

With each new battle, the characters exhibit substantial growth, which is a testament to the series' commitment to character development. Furthermore, the animation quality within ""Bleach"" remains consistently high throughout the series. The battles are choreographed to perfection, ensuring that the action scenes are both riveting and visually stunning. This consistent level of quality helps maintain the viewer's engagement and amplifies the emotional impact of the series' many climactic moments. Fluctuating Pacing and Filler Arcs: Despite its myriad strengths, ""Bleach"" does grapple with pacing issues, particularly in its anime adaptation. Extended battles and the inclusion of filler arcs, which were designed to allow the manga to progress further, can lead to segments of the series feeling sluggish and meandering.

"Bleach is really my favorite shonen anime/manga of all time!(Along with Jojo, Hunter x Hunter and Jujutsu Kaisen of course). The characters are well written and the artstyle is very phenomenal. The story writing and world building is really great for a shonen anime/manga. And the other thing that fascinates me about this masterpiece is its fashion sense just like Jojo. The story is very unique and very unpredictable. The artstyle fits the story very much as it adds the atmosphere. The characters were very relatable as they had their flaws and strengths.

"Bleach is one of the three so-called ""mainstream shonen animes""; together with Naruto and One Piece these three are immensely popular, and the topic of endless comparison among their fans set out to prove that their favorite is the best out of them. They simply refuse to exit their fanboyism to view the series in an objective light, which is a shame, because they are probably missing out on great adventures, which is the case of Bleach in many ways. If you want my review short and good, give Bleach a try no matter what people have said, as it, despite a lot of shortcomings, presents a most interesting and enthralling universe. The concept seems pretty basic at first; there's the Soul Reapers (Shinigami), empowered souls who guide departed human souls to Soul Society, the afterlife deimension, formed after a Feudal Japan. They also fight Hollows, evil and malevolent spirits, to protect living humans and souls alike. So, I assume you have read the plot summary, which covers the basics of the first story arc, which is basically the arc where we are introduced to the main main cast of Bleach; the standard, headstrong, rash and protective teenage shonen hero, his voice of reason in the form of a girl, his arrogant beglassed rival, the ditzy klutz girl with big boobs, and the large, stoic type. Towards the end of said arc however, a real plot appears, events are set into motion, and before long, it has escalated into an assault on said Soul Society a rescue mission from our team of 4-5 heroes, who fight their way through shinigami of all kinds trying to reach their goal, conveniently placed in the middle of this Society. In this arc, you'll get lots of great action and meaningful fights, bottled together with an extremely large and colorful cast of characters, flashbacks and an interesting plot. It all builds up one hell of an end to the arc, 60 or so episodes into the show, where a most intersting twist takes place. And said arc ending is in each and every way the climax of Bleach. Which is its problem. From there it goes steep downhill to two arcs of slow-paced filler, which lowers your excitement a great deal of levels, and from there the show never manages to get you hooked as much as it did during the Soul Society arc. It does get some interesting new aspects and revelations durign the following Arrancar arc, but it never gets really exciting, nor does it get that much greater during the Hueco Mundo arc. It's just too much fighting, and a re-used ""save the damsel in distress"" plot. The colorful cast is not seen as much anymore, and aside some interesting emotional developments courtesy of the former klutz girl, there's not a lot to it, and most fights don't have the same enthralling depth to them which made the fights in SS so unique. Now it's more a display of unique powers, and whatever motivations the bad guys had for their fighting is revealed only after the actual fights, which in ways ruins things. Also, there's a few plot holes to speak of, but nothing large. However, aside the completely random filler arc (which re-used several plot elements from the story), Bleach has shown potential for improvement lately, and it keeps expanding its cast endlessly, which makes the universe seem living in many ways, so we can all only hope that Bleach will improve gradually. However, I sincerely doubt that it will ever be restored to how great it was at its peak, namely the Soul Society rescue arc. It does have a lot of shortcomings, yet it is a most enjoyable watch still. Now, why is that? The answer is the unexpectancy factor it has. Due to its vast cast and great universe, you can't really know what comes next, only make qualified guesses. What kinds of powers will that character have? What is the villain really up to? And what's with that guy? What will happen next? Who knows, who knows. So one could say that the true strength of Bleach lies in its cast, which can bring about mysteries, plot twists and other aspects of awesomeness, and cover up for a somewhat lacking storyline. So what about the asesthetics? there's plenty of people who believe that the visual and auditory aspects of anime are just as important as any plot or character development. And Bleach delivers here, in many ways. The animation quality is quite the hassle to discuss, because it is so varying in quality. At its worst it has low frame rates, offset character designs and framed action, while at its best it is vivid, meticulous and full of soft motions and beautifully animated special and lighting effects. Most of the time however, it is decent. Not average, but not in any way anything brag worthy. Expect some ups and downs in this department. The soundtrack however, is very great. It is greatly varied, and is renewed per story arc, introducing new tunes often whilst keeping the old ones around too, and this variation is intrinsically of any above-average soundtrack. It stays perfectly in tone and atmosphere with the current events, and feature everything from upbeat, adrenaline-pumping electric guitar pieces to miraculous piano pieces, and standard comedic moment tracks. The opening and ending themes feature a lot of types and genres, from the serene and sentimental to rap and rock. And pop, of course. I said it in the beginning, and I'll say it again; try out Bleach at least once, despite what Naruto fans, shonen haters or anyone else have said.

"Best. Anime. Ever. A high school boy gets drafted as a soul reaper, and devotes himself to getting stronger to protect his friends and family. Ichigo Kurosaki breaks the typical shounen mold of overly-optimistic lovable hero with something to prove, by being an ordinary teen with ordinary problems, faced with the weight of extraordinary responsibility: if he doesn’t win, people die. He is angsty, suffering, full of attitude, relatable, cool and badass, but loyal and heroic, and for those reasons, is extremely lovable - and these same qualities can be said of the show as a whole. Gorgeous artwork, amazing voice acting both in English and Japanese, and some of the best character designs I have ever seen across such a wide cast. It has the coolest, most fantastic (magic katana based) fights, set in worlds rich with atmosphere that is enhanced further still by 4 hours of original soundtrack. Bleach has style.

"I know People are not going to like this, but I do not like this series and I cannot rank this in any top 100 animes. Story Confusing and unexciting. I have a rule when I watch new anime, Watch the first 5-10 episodes, then make judgment, I watched 43 and I could not stand the story. It seemed as if the author didn't put much thought until it became popular. It didn't have much of a flow to me neither. It seemed as if they forced out things, like Naruto does, only this seemed more forced. Like when Ichigo fought that thing that had the face of his mother. It seemed very cliche. Art The animation is okay, but the characters, clothing and amongst other things doesn't strike me as anything original. Black robes, big boobs... The only thing I really liked was Chad and Rukia. The two appealing drawings in this anime. Sound Actually, the sound is good and the music is Appealing. The only thing I really liked from Bleach Characters Now some of the characters bother me. As I said, the only two original designs are Rukia and Chad. Both look great but the others are just... not too great. The characters in general, in terms of the series, are decent. I do like Ichigo, but he has moments when he seems very out of character. A lot of moments. It seems all the characters change a lot and little things like that strike me. x_x Overall, Didn't like it, and never going to finish this. I wish it was a little more thought out. I can't stand it. It is like one piece, it seems it will never end. It will eventually, but it should soon.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 16, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c2b09b01db,3,1540
"If you are about to watch bleach and are about to go watch the first few episodes, then your in for a treat. The first/introductory arc of bleach is an brilliant show of anime, truley somthing worth watching. But the problem in my eyes is that it goes very much down hill from there. Some fans (and myself) do believe it will pick up a little from time to time but ultimatly it is not going to wow you with complex or ingaging plot. As with alot of popular anime bleach very quickly gets lost in an unnessicary and almost unwatchably long train of fillers, drawn out fights and repetition on powers and jokes. Unless your new to anime or are caught in its fandom frenzy, then you will probably not beable to sit through the 100's of episodes to come. Story -6- as explained above it takes along time for anything to happen after the first arc. It does have a twists but nothing that will not become blatantly obvious. The fight scenes are not too bad, but most characters only posses about 2 or 3 moves, so it can get boring after their powers have been introduced. The plot lines do run for a while into the story but are usually summed up before starting a new set of events. There are alot of filler arcs that will literally come at any time they see fit, and will plague you with non-cannon storys, they are sometimes funny but generally are just in the way. Art -7- as such a long anime, the style and animation changes during the corse of the show. It is good in parts but is not consistent and is sometimes misleading to the actual abilities of a character. Sound -9- bleach has alot of different tracks related to it, both for the credits and show. When i look back on it, bleach fans are really spoilt for choice in this area. Characters -7- the characters are introduced well in bleach, and get some development, but not as much as you would expect in such a long series. Expect to be juggling names by the end though as it has alot of main and supporting characters (but hey at least their names are easy to remeber). Unfortuantly there will often be parts of this anime that will make you question where all the characters have gone though, as there are so many. Enjoyment -7- this is possibly the most subjective and overlapping category, but generally i would say that bleach does have a certian charm the will have you wanting more (even if you dont know why). I highly enjoyed the first arc and liked the manga that (imo) will make up for some of the problems of popular anime. But as ive said - you wont enjoy this unless you can strap yourself in for a long anime. Overall -6- im going to be fair, its good in places but has alot of faults. If i where you i would have a think about watching this series, and dont just dive in without knowing that you will be watching for a long time.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 23, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5ed32b9963,3,2803
"The series shines in its characterization, with a diverse cast of well-developed characters, each with distinct personalities and motivations. Ichigo, the protagonist, is a relatable and engaging character, grappling with the responsibilities of his newfound powers while trying to maintain a normal life. Supporting characters such as Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Yasutora ""Chad"" Sado contribute to the show's emotional depth and provide unique perspectives on the unfolding events. Bleach's action sequences are one of its main draws, showcasing intense battles and spectacular displays of power. The series' unique combat system, centered around spiritual energy and various types of specialized weaponry, allows for diverse and creative fight scenes. The inventive abilities of the characters, particularly the Soul Reapers and their ""zanpakutō"" swords, provide a visually stunning and often strategic combat experience. The anime's art and animation are generally of high quality, with dynamic and fluid action sequences. The character designs are memorable and distinctive, reflecting Tite Kubo's distinct art style. The soundtrack, composed by Shiro Sagisu, effectively complements the series' tone, with iconic themes such as ""Number One"" and ""Stand Up Be Strong"" enhancing the overall viewing experience. However, Bleach is not without its flaws. The series suffers from pacing issues, particularly in its later arcs, and the inclusion of numerous filler episodes can disrupt the narrative flow. Some fans may also feel that certain plotlines and character arcs remain unresolved or underdeveloped by the end of the series. Despite these shortcomings, Bleach remains a classic shōnen anime that has left a lasting impact on the genre. With its compelling characters, thrilling action, and engaging supernatural elements, Bleach offers an unforgettable viewing experience that will resonate with both casual and dedicated fans of the medium.",9,Recommended,"Apr 18, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_63843a57a7,3,1954
"Spanning 366 episodes, Bleach is regarded as one of the big shonen shows out there, sitting at the same table as One Piece, Naruto and Dragonball. Watching it in 2024, however, I can tell you that Bleach aged like milk. First of all, I could sit here and talk about fillers all day, but we've all seen the memes. Bleach is *at least* 45% filler, but even that is a generous number. If you remove all the useless shonen tropes like pointless flashbacks, repetitive shouts, long running scenes, still shots, slow camera panning and reused frames, you'll soon realize that Bleach is more like 70% filler. Bleach also has a serious issue with bystanders that *constantly* interrupt fights and serious moments so they can do their comedy routine. And it's not even good comedy. It's children's comedy. Manzai is a very popular (and exhausting) type of comedy where the ""funny man"" does goofy things while the ""straight man"" gets angry and reprimands them. Alright, now crank that up to the maximum, shove it in the middle of life-or-death situations, and make it as long and obnoxious as possible. That's Bleach's comedy. The thing is, Bleach knows how to create funny moments, but it does so at the worst possible times as the story progresses. Speaking of progress, that's one of the weird things about Bleach. Instead of getting better as the series goes on (like the other three big shonen series), Bleach does the opposite. One quick search and you'll see that the community generally agrees that Bleach was awesome in the first few arcs but had a drastic decline in quality and pacing as the story progressed. Even my friend who recommended it to me said that he skipped almost all of it. Putting Bleach on the same category as Dragonball, One Piece and Naruto is almost disrespectful. How can I recommend a series that only has one or two good arcs and then say: ""By the way, it gets really bad towards the end."" -- Minor Spoilers Ahead -- Another big issue that Bleach has are the power levels. The power levels are all over the place and it's not even funny. Ichigo always gets his ass kicked by every new enemy, only to be saved by someone he defeated previously. Now the person who is supposedly weaker than Ichigo proceeds to defeat the villain who is supposedly stronger than Ichigo. This happens because Bleach is a kid's show where the protagonist befriends all of his enemies, even the ones that do unspeakably evil things. No matter how edgy Bleach tries to be with its dark imagery, at the end of the day it's just a kid's show. The constant bickering in the middle of fights is no different than children fighting in the playground to decide who gets to be the Red Power Ranger, and in the end we see everyone holding hands and singing a song together. Bleach looks particularly ugly when you compare it to the flashy and action-packed modern shonen shows we've been getting recently, but it also looks ugly when you compare it to the other big shonen shows of the 2000s. The action, pacing, story and even the training arcs are completely messed up. Honestly, I basically just watched 366 episodes of a show I detest for the sole purpose of watching the sequel, which people say is really good. The sad thing about Bleach is that it had such a strong identity. The captains are cool as hell, the overall theme is unique, the setting had a lot of potential, and the Soul Society arc was amazingly good. I loved everything about Bleach at first. Hell, even the way the characters hold their swords when they're not fighting tells you something about their character. Even some of the lines that characters say are so powerful that they'll stick with you for a while. The creativity and attention to detail here was great, and I hate using the past tense here. Honestly, I don't even think that this is the case of a bad anime adaptation. For example, you've probably heard someone somewhere say: ""Bleach is good but the ending was kinda scuffed."" And no, it's not like a beloved character dies or anything. The ""ending"" is bad because the author decided to introduce the weirdest and most nonsensical magic system ever created. Everything that made Bleach great is suddenly replaced by elements that genuinely make you forget that you're watching Bleach. Hueco Mundo's arc was bad in terms of pacing and power levels, but the last arc is especially insulting. Bleach's antagonists stopped being cool and memorable after the Soul Society arc (save for a few exceptions), but the last arc manages to be even worse in that regard. We even get a discount Aizen that fails to capture even 1% of what made the original a good villain. In conclusion, I unfortunately can't recommend Bleach. It's simply not worth it. It doesn't hold up well today and only serves as an example of how to ruin something that had everything to be great. This review may sound overly negative, but it's just an honest warning.",3,Not Recommended,"Mar 26, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a64d2b7c53,3,4912
"Story-The first two and a half seasons were really entertaining, although painfully unoriginal. I hate to downrank the show so much as it was one of the main things that got me back into watching anime, but the storyline past ep 62ish is a complete and utter disaster. I'm not even sure how I stomached the full year of Bounto filler, and have recently dropped the series as there is yet again an entire arc of total nonsense that has nothing to do with the plot whatsoever. Also the main story itself is plagued with repetition, the antagonists are nearly identical in personality (grimmjow=kenpachi, ulquiorra=byakuya) as the soul society arc and the situations are all exactly the same. My suggestion, watch this show to episode 65 and stop, you aren't missing anything past that. I would give the show 8/10 if it was only 65 episodes long. Art-Once again, started off excellent. I thought the first couple seasons had great animation, and the combat scenes were pretty well done. This area sadly however, seems to deteriorate along with the storyline, not quite as badly but compare the fights in seasons 1-3 to the ones after and the show just isn't showing us anything new. Sound-The music is ok, and it fits well. Repetitive sure, but it's a shounen with 180+ episodes how could the music not be repetitive. The sound quality overall isn't bad, my only complaint would be the op/end themes especially in season 3 and up. Character-The characters, like the story aren't very fresh, but they're well developed and pretty likable. The main downfall in my opinion is the overdevelopment of the enormous cast of worthless sidecharacters. It gets really bogged down with this at times, there is even an entire season dedicated to doing this (5th season). Enjoyment-First 3 seasons 9/10, rest 1/10. Starts out very addictive and fun to watch but trails on to &quot;why am I watching this.&quot;",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 8, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2b2ef254a8,3,1894
"Bleach, the popular anime series based on Tite Kubo's manga, has captivated audiences worldwide with its unique blend of action, supernatural elements, and compelling character arcs. Spanning multiple seasons, Bleach offers a rich and expansive world filled with intriguing lore, intense battles, and a diverse cast of characters.

The series masterfully weaves together action-packed battles, intricate plotlines, and moments of introspection, creating a narrative that keeps viewers engaged and invested throughout its run.

"The only reason Bleach is not considered the best of the Big 3 and the greatest Shōnen Anime of all time is the interspersed filler episodes in-between canon episodes and specifically the long stretch of filler episodes right after Soul Society arc between Episodes 64-108 which effectively killed any momentum the series had and put a massive strain on Bleach’s popularity. That’s it. Every time I hear critiques of the series; like the problematic power-scaling, underdeveloped side characters, or repetitive narrative formula, it’s all problems that exist in other Shōnen to FAR greater extent. Naruto has the most criminal waste of potential side characters in all of fiction. One Piece, which I love, has the exact same storyline formula for every single arc except maybe 2 or 3 (and that series goes on for literally thousands of episodes). Bleach has objectively the most well-developed main protagonist and antagonist out of the Big 3. Aizen is possibly the greatest villain in all Anime; Shōnen or Seinen (the only one that even comes close is Johan Liebert — but even then I’d argue Aizen is more compelling and terrifying because of his godlike supernatural abilities). Ichigo is a profoundly refreshing character in a sea of generic Shōnen MCs who all share the same goal: “to be the BEST _insert-title-here_” Ichigo just wants to live out a life where he redeems his most pivotal moment; that of losing his mother due to his supernatural abilities. His drive to rescue Rukia/Orihime originates from that insecurity; to not lose that love anymore, especially when it comes as a consequence of his own actions such as accidentally taking all of Rukia’s Soul Reaper ability which set in motion her planned execution. Bleach also has the best theming of any Anime I’ve ever seen. The whole Spanish ‘Day of the Dead’ aesthetic runs through every aspect of the series; from Shiro Sagisu’s godlike Spanish-inspired soundtrack, to the Hollow designs, to the worldbuilding etc. The soundtrack itself is by far the greatest of any Anime, with some of the best OPs in Anime history. And to top it all off… here’s Bleach’s greatest accomplishment when compared to almost every other long-running Anime: it actually has a good ending. Yes, the manga’s ending was rushed and trashed due to Shōnen Jump executives, but the Studio Pierrot Anime adaptation of the Thousand Year Blood War arc is absolutely GOATED. I don’t need to say any more. Bleach is the greatest Shōnen Anime of all time. The late, great Akira Toriyama didn’t go out of his way to personally give his blessing to Tite Kubo for nothing. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Feb 9, 2025",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_986d969d6c,3,2608
"We are introduced to the world of Bleach though the experiences of Ichigo Kurosaki, a fifteen-year-old high school student who has great personal spirit energy and happens to be able to see spirits. As a result of what appears to be an accidental encounter with Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami or &quot;soul reaper&quot; (literally &quot;death god&quot;), during which she is seriously wounded trying to protect him from a hungry ghost known as a Hollow, Ichigo ends up with her borrowed Soul Reaper powers and her mandate to protect human beings from the Hollows which try to prey on them. In the meantime, Rukia herself is stranded in an artificial human body and joins Ichigo as a student in his class, limited to being a guide for him until her powers return. Later in the series, the spirit powers of two other students in Ichigo's school will also awaken as a direct result of personal encounters with the spirit world; while a third is discovered to be a secret warrior in the ongoing battle to protect humanity from the Hollows. However, the series takes great care to emphasise that the vast majority of people live their lives without ever realising that this other world exists all around them. While the Soul Reapers have tools which assist this continued lack of awareness, they are rarely needed. Until Rukia takes on her human body, no one except Ichigo is able to see her. Even when Hollows are at their most destructive, most human beings can't see, sometimes even refuse to see: and many, including Ichigo himself, try to come up with rational explanations for what they cannot understand until rationalisation is no longer possible. In the central mythos of Bleach, humans souls come to the Soul Society at death, to be reborn years or centuries later into the world of the living in a vast cosmic balance. Even Hollows are not so much killed as freed from their unhealthy attachment to a world of which they should no longer be a part. The purpose and duty of the Soul Reaper is to protect this cosmic balance at any cost. Emotional and other merely &quot;human&quot; considerations have no place in the Soul Reaper's samurai-like focus on duty, a parallel further emphasised by the outfit of the Soul Reaper and by the symbol and focus of the Soul Reaper's power, the spirit-sword, or zanpakuto. White, the undyed or bleached lack of all colour, is traditionally a symbol of death and mourning in eastern cultures; but it is also the colour of emptiness and thus of beginnings. In Pure Land Buddhism, white represents the Buddhist interrum paradise where souls are brought to help them achieve enlightenment, and from which a few enlightened souls will return to help other Buddhists arrive at the Pure Land. (Interestingly, later episodes in the series make it clear that Soul Reapers were themselves once human.) In many ways black, its polar opposite, is also its complement: death, yes, but also enlightened awareness sharing its knowledge, wisdom, and power while seeking to learn anew. In English, the words &quot;black&quot; and &quot;bleach&quot; even derive from the same root word. In the black and white world of the Soul Reapers, the orange-haired Ichigo continually inserts a jagged element of awkward humanity into Soul Reaper abstraction. Like so many other top-quality anime series, Bleach is adapted from a manga, or graphic story (comic book), which has been running in Weekly Shonen Jump magazine since 2001. While many manga-based anime soon run into the problem of getting ahead of the existing manga storyline, Bleach takes its time developing individual character storylines, and thus ends up with some of the best developed personalities in the entire field. Consequently this anime does demand a little more active work than most on the part of the viewer: but it is well worth the effort.",9,Recommended,"Sep 18, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ca11901937,3,3830
"I've always thought that the big 3 were not so good, don't know why but they all seemed quite ok. Last year I decided to watch one of them, Bleach, and oh boy I'm so glad I did it. It is a battle shonen mainly focused on battles and powers but still manages to have an interesting story with well done characters. In particular what i loved about Bleach are the characters, while yes maybe some of them are kinds of stereotypes, others are really well written and appreciable. There are little to no plot holes and the events are not forced like it sometimes happens in other battle shonen. OSTs and openings are fantastic and the overall quality of the anime is good considering it's age. The only bad thing I have to say is that maybe there are a little bit too much fillers but you can skip them so it's not a big deal. The anime without fillers is around 178 episodes, all the films are not canon. My final consideration is that if you like battle shonen, definitely give a chance to bleach.

"This is my first review! ^^&quot; Where to begin? At first... this anime didn't catch my eye. I thought that it wasnt going to be worth my time on account of the story sounded a little... odd and off. But as I started to watch the anime more and more, I really began to fall in love with everything that this anime has to offer. ~STORY~ First things first, the story is very interesting. The first episode really caught my attention--and I wanted more. At time the story line can drag on, and I found it hard to watch, but the other parts of the anime really outweigh the bad parts. The plot has everything from your typical shonen funny moments to the serious and tense scences, to the little romantic moments here and there. ~ART~ The art... is very good for a shonen anime. Most of the time (as some can tell) shojo anime is usually drawn a little better that shonen, but I find that Bleach's animation is very good. Sometimes it can be a little inconsistant, but otherwise, I love it. ~SOUND~ Wow. The sound, everything is catchy. The opening and ending songs all are very catchy, and they relate to what is going on in the anime at that time. The background music really fits the different scenes, but to me sometimes they don't.... but they sound is still very good. ~CHARACTERS~ This anime probably has my favorite cast of characters. All of them are really lovable and you just can't say you hate them all. The characters don't look the same, as with some other anime. All of them have very different personalities and looks. Overall... the characters are probably the best part of this anime. ~ENJOYMENT~ Bleach is a very nice anime. I enjoy it a lot on account of how smooth everything is. I really do like it. ~OVERALL~ This anime is a must for all who like to watch anime.

"Bleach, From the very beginning of the Anime i totally enjoyed the story line it gave us to imagine. A simple student to be a death god is great. It really does sink into you and it draws out more and more excitement towards all aspects. This Anime isn't just about characters that stay the same throughout the whole series but people that evolve into things in-imaginable, the characters just keep adapting and it becomes more and more intense as the season goes on. The share brutality and inspirationally characteristics that characters have do inspire a lot of watchers as do myself, it even has a sensitive side that brings the fiction with the fact. i must conclude this by saying it is personally the top Anime i have watched and i hope it continues to grow not just on me but all the viewers who watch and enjoy it. 10/10 is my rating",10,Recommended,"Jan 9, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3e33d20c8e,3,842
"-First this is my first review so don&acute;t be too harsh on me. About Bleach: Story: (6-fair) The story isn&acute;t bad, it isn&acute;t perfect, but what really ruins the story is this two facts: first, the story has a damn slow progress, so you can see episodes where you simply watch half of a fight that isn&acute;t even one of the most important.Second is the fact that bleach has a lot of fillers ( i have nothing againts fillers, when they are good ones), and most of them are terrible and sometimes boring. But i can&acute;t give less than a 6, after all, the idea of the soul society and captains is quite good. Art: (6-fair) Art in bleach is not bad, but in my opinion could be better.. battles should be better, also caracther design is nothing special. Still, again, i can&acute;t give less than a 6 because there are some good ideias that makes the art not bad at all. Sound (6-fair) Sound is not a thing i give much value in anime, in fact i already saw great animes with terrible sound (in my opinion). But it&acute;s always better to have good sound and well synchronized with the story. However, i don&acute;t really like some openings, endings are not so great at all, and during the story is also not amazing, but it&acute;s at least aceptable so 6 fits quite well. Character (7-good) Character is for me one of the strongest points in bleach..i like the Shinigami hierarchy, especially some captains (like Zaraki Kenpachi, Hitsugaya, etc..). Also Bounto are not bad as well (i am still watching, but i have already formed and opinion). The main characters are good, but i don&acute;t really like orihime, some shinigami and the modified souls don&acute;t sound great to me, so only a 7, anyway, still great, cause i don&acute;t give high ratings so easily, it must be really almost perfect or have something special to deserve more. Enjoyment (7-good) Enjoyment? Well i can watch the episodes without getting to sleep or disconect myself..so i can say i like to watch bleach, however, there are some lame parts, some boring parts that could be avoided..but in the other way abillities and fights, and even some comic scenes, sound good, yeah i also like to laugh, but some character abillities really catch my attention so 7 sounds quite good for enjoyment. Overall (7-good) you may ask, i gave more 6 than 7s, why a 7 in overall? Well, the fact is that bleach is quite a good anime to watch, it hasn&acute;t something special to me, but it&acute;s like a balanced one, it focus a little in all aspects, so it makes easier to get the attention and after all it&acute;s one of the most famous anime nowadays, that&acute;s why.",7,Recommended,"Dec 10, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_99910f6b03,3,2646
"Bleach -- one of the top dogs of shonen anime. And I'm going to say this right now -- Bleach is probably my favorite anime. I've cosplayed it, I've cleaned it/fansub'd it, and hell, I even wrote a 4000 word essay on the structure of the story. It's a very large and compelling anime...just with a lot of drawbacks. Story -- 7 The story of Bleach is long, complex*, and colorful, to say the least. It has a gripping plotline(for the beginning anyway), and can manage to interest anyone for at least a little while. Its filler arcs aren't so bad (see: Naruto fillers) to bring tears to the eyes, but they aren't exactly as entertaining as the normal story. The impression I got when I first started watching Bleach was that the author, Tite Kubo, had no idea what he was doing. It was sort of like an idea popped into his head, he drew it (it was then animated later) and that became the story. This doesn't lead to a bad storyline.The story, in my opinion, is very good, developed, and complex. However, because of the issue listed above, there are several plot holes due to the fact his ideas came spontaneously. One such being that shinigami, in the first few arcs, are unable to fly (this is reinforced by the fact Ichigo, the main character, has to steal a pair of wings to move quickly around Soul Society). About halfway through, however, all spirits suddenly gained the capability to fly, negating the whole thing about Ichigo having to steal wings. This change is worked in subtly, and I didn't even notice for a while. However, contradictions like this are present in the story of Bleach. And while it doesn't ruin the story, it does detract from the overall experience. However, the story does start to degrade somewhat after the first main story arc ends (ie. when Rukia is saved). It jumps from filler to story randomly throughout the remaining episodes to allow the manga to get a further headstart; the main story arcs are not too bad, but they never reach the full potential that was shown in the first. *Edited in note: I had referred to the story of Bleach as ""complex."" I wanted to clarify that the storyLINE is not complex, the the world the story takes place in is. It has a lot of ongoing elements which are managed decently well, showing that Tite Kubo can manage a large, complex world with not too much difficulty. The plot is by no means complex. Art -- 7 Unlike Naruto Shipp., Bleach has had fairy consistent art. It does peak at some times and slouch at others, but it is basically consistent. It isn't stellar, and can't compare to the likes of Romeo X Juliet, Code Geass, Eureka 7, etc. But for a mainstream shonen, it's acceptable and palatable. Honestly, I would just leave art blank...it doesn't really add or subtract from the show, at all. Sound -- 8 Bleach, for being one the top kings of shonen anime, has a lot of very recognizable tunes. Many of them are sweet, many sad, and are generally very fitting. Most of the opening themes and end themes are well done and enjoyable, and overall, very recognizable and memorable. Yui's ""Rolling Star,"" the several themes by Aqua Timez, and other themes make the anime have both popular, modern Japanese pop/rock music, as well as some very beautiful, haunting instrumental pieces (See: Never Meant to Belong). The music I'd say is tied with Naruto's and far ahead of One Piece's. It doesn't quite match up to Romeo X Juliet's (see: Lena Park's cover of ""You Raise Me Up""), but is overall very decent and well rounded, as to be expected of a big budget show like Bleach. Character -- 6 Bleh. Character. There really isn't too much development character wise; one of the main supporting characters, Orihime, does manage to grow from the frightened girl to a mature(ish), courageous (albeit still useless) supporting character. Ichigo, the protagonist, also progresses in terms of his understanding of the world(he seemed very naive in the beginning of the anime, and seems much more experienced now, though they are overplaying this a little much). The major drawback to Bleach's characters is the way their power levels are determined. Ichigo starts off incredibly weak, barely able to beat anyone -- and in a matter of days, thanks to a three day crash course in Shinigami fighting (must be one hell of a crash course) manages to beat some of the toughest shinigami around, including the Third Seat (third most powerful) of the fighting squad, and then shortly after the leader of the fighting squad. By the end of the first arc, Ichigo is able to, with only his fists, destroy three second-seats(a.k.a. vice-captains) in the Shinigami military without breaking a sweat. So by the end of that arc, you understand, wow, Ichigo is really, really badass. But then you find him again shortly after, and he's back to fighting like crap and can't beat anything. And then some amazing thing will happen (see:Hollowfication) that will make him stronger than any shinigami, and then he will have his power cut back, again. And it continues like this. Ichigo, a lot like other characters, seems to have ""Godlike"" strength, and can only fight equally 'Godlike' characters, otherwise the fights would be boring. This is nice and all, but when he actually physically changes from maybe the worst fighter to the best and then back again, the confusion that ensues between the ""god fights"" is confusing and disconcerting, to say the least. Enjoyment -- 7 Bleach has awesome fight scenes. And a very large world, with a lot to think about. I personally love Bleach, and it remains one of my favorite anime. But it has a lot of drawbacks. It has very poor character development, and serious issues in character balancement. It also has meh art, which isn't something bad, but nothing good, either. The story is nice and long. But it has a lot of holes in it, as well as having issues with entertainment value in filler vs. main story. The fact that it randomly skips around often due to the filler also adds confusion, since sometimes the filler will occur BEFORE the arc you were just watching. Overall -- 7.0 .5 lower than Naruto Shippuuden, in my opinion. Bleach is worth a watch if you enjoy the stereotypical shonens: it's creative and interesting. But it is a show MADE for people to watch: it's a mainstream shonen. Naruto had the hand up on terms of story depth, in my opinion, as well as consistency in the story. They both have good soundtracks and VA's, and both have not-so-good character development. The enjoyment varies; I honestly think Bleach has a higher rewatch-ability, but Naruto has some very specific episodes which are amazing.",7,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8c1071df8f,4,6612
"Disclaimer: This is the first ever review I am ever writing on this site. Please do not expect an outstanding piece of work out of this review. Additionally, this is my personal opinion and you may choose to agree or disagree with me. Thank you. I got into Bleach after reading all about its generally positive feedback. I agreed with all the positive things I have seen about the anime until they started introducing some really trashy fillers, not to mention the extremely long and draggy battles fought throughout the course of the anme, Well, to be fair, I do know why they do these fillers: To ensure that the anime does not catch up with the manga too quickly. However, the problem with Bleach is that most of the fillers are really, really hate-able. Provided,I found the Shinigami Zanpakuto Unknown arc to be particularly enjoyable until Muramasa revealed that he materialized all the Zanpakuto just so to revive his ""beloved"" master (who abandoned him for his selfish ego). Not to mention that the arc involving the ""Bounto"" was extremely boring, and full of corny jokes (I especially disliked the creepy chicken doll who acted in an extremely bitchy manner). For the story-line, I think the only *really* good one ever done was the arc where Ichigo first met Rukia, and then had to go rescue her. Everything then went downhill from there (Yes, that includes the manga). Additionally, the common trend for most battles in the series follows this formula: 1) Both sides stare at each other in an *ahem* intimidating manner. 2) One of them says something to irritate the opposing side, and the other reacts by attacking (and making a huge fuss about it by a) screaming {SHUT UP! (URUSAI!) } or b) keeping silent so as to make fans go like ""KYAA~~~! He/She's so DANRED cool!"") 3) This is when flashbacks will start appearing, and we will literally be scammed into watching stuff we have already seen before. 4) When one of them has the upper hand, he/she just haaas to spoil it by going like ""Behind you! (Kochi!)"", ""Where do you think you are looking (Doko ni irun da?!)"", or some other phrase to attract the opponent's attention. This spoils the mood of the fight by extending it for a unnecessarily longer period of time (in terms of episodes). 5) The fella on the ""good side"" will almost always get defeated (with more flashbacks too) and some other idiot screaming (I will avenge you!) in the background, and then . . . The fight against the same opponent continues for more episodes! The art used in the series is very well done, with fresh backgrounds introduced frequently in various scenes and angles, so as to perk up the animations. The sound effects are well, okay (the same effects are used throughout many other series), and the music is astoundingly memorable, with my favorite being ""Nothing can be Explained"". It is hence a huge pity that all of this beautifully-done artwork and music is being wasted on an anime that has lost its glamour ever since its first arc. To sum up this review, I will strongly recommend *new* viewers to quit following the series after the end of the Soul Society arc.",4,Not Recommended,"Feb 24, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_194ba6c39a,4,3119
"Bleach was an anime i got into after a recommendation from a friend. At the time I had caught up to naruto and was looking for another good shounen anime. I was introduced to bleach and I was hooked. However as time passed, the quality of the series took a significant dip. Here is why. Story- In the beginning Bleach had alot going for it. It had an interesting premise. Shinigami aka Death gods send Hollows or Evil spirits to the after life. It was comparable to ghost busters if i may say so. The 1st 15 episodes were of this nature, focusing on Ichigo Kurosaki the main character slaying hollows. The introduction of Renji And Byakuya shook things up and propelled the story into its 2nd arc, The Soul Society arc. This was were Bleach was at its peak: Brand new characters were introduced, The awe inspiring concept of Shikais and Bankais were jaw dropping at the time and a mysterious conspirator moved in the background. It was all very very good stuff. The infamous reveal at the end of the SS arc made me excited that big things were on the way for bleach Then the bount arc happened. A 45 episode long filler, while decent for a filler made my interest in bleach drop. Sadly as the arrancar arc began, that interest never really picked up as the same damsel in distress plotline was rehashed, the plot devolved into 1 vs 1 battles every episode with no real story or character development and ludicrous plot twists arose. Kubos bleach train had long since derailed itself from its tracks by the time the Arrancar Arc ended and The fullbring arc began. Now the once impressive Bankais are no big deal since every character can use them. The damage had been done. 300+ episodes of pointless fighting had all but destroyed any hope i had for the series. The fullbringer arc was a major letdown and is widely considered to be the worst arc in Bleach. With uninteresting villains, a plot clearly made up as it went along and a very weak conclusion, this arc destroyed the show and resulted in its eventual cancellation. Currently The Thousand Year War Arc is going on in the manga and while better than the Arrancar and fullbringer arcs, It has again fallen into the same old 'Forget plot, focus on 1 on 1 battles' formula that has plagued bleach since the arrancar saga began all those years ago. Art- The art is a major plus point for bleach. Certain fights are animated beautifully and i could sit down and watch those repeatedly. Kubo has always had an eye for great character designs. However the lack of backgrounds brings the rating down. Sound- Bleach has an excellent soundtrack. The arrancar arc especially has some catchy spanish tunes while the bounto arc has haunting music befitting the vampire theme of that arc. Overall id say its worth a listen. Character- Bleach has cool character designs but an overload of characters, many of whom overlap with each other. In other words in its like creating a new character but throwing in a personality of another old character. e.g Riruka and Hiyori. There was alot of potential in bleach before. Now characters have just become caricatures of themselves with no real character progression. Inoue is still a damsel in distress. Chad still lies face down in a pool of his own blood. Mayuris mad scientist vibe which was once scary has been made into a running gag. Byakuya and Kenpachi are now jokes. Ichigo is the only character capable of holding his own to the enemy and thats in part due to kubos inability to decide what to do with him. Is he a hollow, shinigami quincy or fullbringer? Kubo has no idea what to do with Ichigos character and even goes so far as to negate everything we have learnt about the characters sword for the past 500 chapters in a major ass pull. Not good. Enjoyment- Bleach was once very enjoyable. Now i read it for the sake of it, just to finish it. Overall- Id recommend the 1st 63 episodes. Otherwise skip it. Its not worth the time.",3,Not Recommended,"Feb 10, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_96e4196dd1,4,3929
"Bleach is an interesting anime... the first episode blew me away, the art, the sound, the portrayal of the characters... The development of Ichigo as a Shinigami and his gradual acceptance of this new plane of existence was interesting to watch and just as we viewers are settling in, BANG!!! Events are put into motion that see our main protagonist stabbed several times and left for dead by the soul 'powers that be.' Woah, i thought, pretty heavy stuff. Then came the Soul Society arc and that too is amazing, the reiatsu effects, the animation of the fights, the snappy dialouge (Kenpachi's blood crazed babbling about Ichigo's power level is still a highlight for me.) There's some big evil conspiracy... etc i won't spoil it too much for those who haven't already watched it but if your on this website and still haven't figured out the conventions of shonen anime then... go figure. Of course as with all shonen series all is eventually resovled, but its not long before things start to go wrong. Hyper powerful bad guys show up, and thats when things start to turn sour. Huge power discrepancies and plot holes have begun to appear in the last couple of arcs (this especially applies to the manga btw) but hopefully these will be resolved over the next year or so. All in all though its a good watch which does put a somewhat new spin on the shonen genre in my eyes (for example instead of just having a stronger version of a form Kubo was inventive enough to 'blur lines'. Should be interesting to see what he does for the next power up if there is one). And so i leave you with this anime fans If you like sword fights, magic, comedy, a bit of blood, sexual tension and good ol' climatic 'final blow explosion things' then you'll enjoy Bleach.",9,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd55fe4d2a,4,1753
"Bleach has got to be one of the worst series I have ever watched and I've watched 113 series. I heard that the show will be returning soon so I have to deliver the facts as to why this series is dead Firstly , The story in Bleach is so tedious and lacklustre , it is a blatant Yu Yu Hakusho ripoff and in short , it follows a teenage boy who gets chosen to be a part of the Spirit FBI and so he joins and as such is forced to wear a ridiculous outfit and fight with a kitchen knife The power scaling in this show is all over the goddamn place , everytime I sneezed Ichigo had a new power up and I thought it couldn't get worse than Dragon Ball The characters in this show are so generic and one-dimensional , You get your cliche dumb but strong (thanks to plot) MC , generic emo kid and generic tsundere who only has one line throughout the whole series The music in this series is awful and overrated Overall : Stay away from this garbage , I've also read TYBW arc in the manga , it did absolutely different aside from give me the best sleep of my life . This series is drawn out , badly written and just unenjoyable don't waste your time",1,Not Recommended,"Nov 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_86099ff853,4,1139
"Death Gods, demonic entities, transforming super-powered weapons that might possibly have the potential annihilate the world....What is there not to like about Bleach? And for the record i will consider only the main story in this review. The story is straightforward but has a lot of details to go with it, though i'll leave it simplistic to avoid spoilers. It begins with a teenage boy name Kurosaki Ichigo, though in my opinion he appears a bit older, and he meets a shinigami by the name of kuchiki Rukia. Through an incident that involves the lives of Ichigo's family, Ichigo gains shinigami powers and is subsequently forced to do Rukia's job as shinigami, becoming a subsitute shinigami. From the awakening the his powers, Ichigo also inadvertently awakens the hidden powers of his friends, Inoue Orihime and Sado Yasutora, through several incidents during Ichigo's job as a substitute shinigami for Rukia. He also meets Ishida Uryuu, a archer of sorts, and all of them will eventually work together, though you'll have to watch to see how and why. Soon after Rukia is forced back to her world, known as soul society, and Ichigo and company follow suit in order to help her out. Compressing a lot events together, Ichigo manages to help out Rukia and finds out that there are more sinister things going on in soul society, and of course, Ichigo and the others are dragged into all of it. The story of bleach is entertaining, and alternates between many fight scenes, and dialogue to push the story ahead. At many times the story can be tense but the occasional lightheartedness makes it much better. While the artwork of the characters and background are quality work, there are some animes that are much better (don't take it too seriously as i was being very critical about the art). The characters are exquisitely made, with each character having a unique and memorable personality, but also very deep and complex, which is for the better. Overall, Bleach is one anime series that you should add to your watching list.",9,Recommended,"Jul 8, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_372c6d4b5c,4,2028
"Bleach used to be my favorite show, the SS arc was very interesting despite being dragged and I had enjoyed the begining of Arancar arc but... this show has no excitement for me now. The only pluses left are the character designs, I still admire Kubo for his drawing skills and design but as an author he fails. There is no real story anymore. We are stuck with constant fightings with no real progrss. Even those fights are boring for one simple reason - you know how it will end: a) Good guy wins b) Good guy gets help and wins In both scenarios bad guy loses and dies. The whole arrancar arc happend to be a waste of time. They made no change to the story. All good guys are still alive and all their lost limbs will be restored by Orihime. Kubo said that he plans to do more arcs so al those shikais/bankai will appear again. He basicly wasted 2-3 years on nothing. Espadas had received so much heap in the beginig, captains almost pissed themselves yet all espadas were defeated easily even by those who are not that powerful. It was also said that Vasto Lordes are at he same level as captains if not stronger and that 10 of them could destroy SS. And later Kubo states in interview that part of espadas were Vasto Lorde... who had lost quiet easily... just WTF?! Where did all the promised power go?! Shouldn't they be even MORE dangerouse after being hollowied by Hougyoko? How the hell that one sided battle can be called a war? All bad guys are dead while all goodies are alive... jsut what kind of fairy tale is that?! Where is the drama, tension, deaths? How can you be excited about a fight when you know how it will end? Also another huge minus is Ichigo. I will be quiet about SS arc where this loser was able to beat captains with hundreds years of experiance only after several week training. They should have been able to kill him with closed eyes! Having talent wouldn't save your ass gaianst masters in such short time. But ok, I can live with that... Better tell me what the hell is with all those power ups?! He always gets beaten down or killed but then once Orihime opens her mouth, he smashes bad guy in seconds, just WTF?! How is that possible?! He even comes back to life after being killed! Then he gets into some convenient place where he can train and owns bad guys ass. Also why all bad guys had turned into idiots? Why good guys who are served in half and have crushed organs are alive, but bad guys with some cuts are dead? THIS SUCKS! I give this show 5 only from respect of the old times and the characters which I still like. If not those things, it would be 1! P.S. Killing bad guy who has become good doesn't mean that you have killed a goodie.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 18, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ff5b5aab25,4,2682
"Art - Character design is ok, but it gets QUALITY a lot. The action in Bleach is even more boring than Naruto. 1 out of 3. Character - The characters are dumb. Everyone has to talk shit to each other before, during, and after beating each other up. Completely brainless egotistical behavior. I was actually surprised when Ichimaru Gin somehow managed to prevent Kenpachi from fighting Byakuya. But later on I was relieved when the captains finally begin fighting each other - it was only a matter of time. Luckily all they seem to be capable of doing was cutting each other on the shoulder. Fucking stupid. Obviously Death Gods and Hollows have neither parents nor siblings so there's no need to talk about those. 0 out of 4. Story - Nonsensical ghost story with DBZ-esque power-ups added in. Fights devolve into beamspamming. Nobody ever dies. Whole story summarized: Aizen trolls everyone. 0 out of 3.

"Bleach is so good. Like, seriously. And people say it's trash just because of the fillers. Like, guys, just skip them. You can do so, then do so. Because the only problem of Bleach is fillers (which, by the way, are never worse than the Naruto ones). I skipped all of them, and what I've seen was simply awsome. The story is great, with great plot-twists too. Aizen is the best antagonist ever. All the characters are so well-written and the bankais are amazing. They're all so unique! There also are very deep speeches, great battles, and the music... oh, the music! The openings are all bangers, and the background music is really good too. The animation isn't the best, but it's not the worst either.

"[Sorry for my bad English, I'm not english... I used Google Translate for this rewiew... Really sorry...] ""Bleach"" is one of those Anime who needs no introduction. Anyone even remotely meant Anime certainly knows him, being the only one able to rival the more famous ""Naruto"" and ""One Piece"". Despite the paper version is still in progress, the anime ""Bleach"" has ended, and in my opinion could do it already episode 310. I hate to give only 9 to ""Bleach"", it 'was my favorite anime for some time and I would have gladly given a 10, were it not for the final saga about Fullbring, that I did not like very much. Let's order: ""Bleach"" is a shounen that stands out from the others, as has been widely criticized for having little dialogue. This would be a disadvantage? I think it is the strong point of ""Bleach"". In a shounen, focused on the fighting, it is these that must occupy much space as possible. It 'just that he wants the viewer, not absurd, and sometimes irritating, monologues and / or flashbacks that do not give anything to anyone, that can be found in large amounts in the aforementioned ""Naruto"" and' 'One Piece' '. I'm just fighting the strong point of ""Bleach"": OST sublime, epic duels, characters, one more badass of the other, and a simple plot and linear, since actually only serves to give a logical clashes between Hollow, evolved or no, and Shinigami. So fighting exceptional and charismatic characters as I did not see the legendary ""Dragonball Z"", just think of the epic Freezer. Yes, certainly, ""Bleach"" could take, from signed, a 10, in my private list I gave it, but here, having to review, I could not do it, for the reason I mentioned above; in fact, it is logical to think, an Anime, in the long run, in most cases, it ends up ruined, and unfortunately this is well evident in ""Bleach"". WARNING SPOILERS: The author has evidently finished ideas, and in order not to end the manga, with all the rounds of money that goes with it, he decided to continue it, although the story is, in my opinion, but also according to many others, ended after the episode 310, or volume 48, whichever you prefer. The defeat of Aizen, powerful to request a deus ex machina, as the unlikely transformation of Ichigo in a shinobi with long hair blacks, it was a perfect ending of the entire work. It seems obvious to me. The final boss is defeated, and with him all his subordinates. There are more enemies to defeat, and Ichigo lost his powers, returning the human that was the beginning. A worthy ending, leaving no room to continue, just as it should be. But no. Tite Kubo, decided to deface this series literally, inventing a saga, the fact of Fullbring, only to be able to give back the powers to Ichigo, and continue so the entire manga. This has been the bane of ""Bleach"", which has become another ""Naruto."" That said, I would still recommend ""Bleach"" to anyone looking for souls crammed clashes, and characters as charismatic as strong, one shounen badass, in short.",9,Recommended,"Nov 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ef3fb0fe2c,4,2983

"Bleach is a story with a lot of potential. It falls short almost every time it has a chance to impress the viewer/reader. Almost every fight goes the same way, a new move/form is either discovered or they get reinforcements, the character depth doesn’t get explored very much throughout the series for well over half of the cast, everyone is often times fairly one dimensional as well, one can also argue the lore feels very strung together at times and serves the plot at complete randomness, arcs drag on a bit too long and overstay their welcome, arcs repeat similar patterns as previous ones, the power scaling is very linear and this leaves for not many surprises in battle, every interaction is plot armored heavily leaving it to feel like characters have minimal agency over their own story, while ichigo is cool, he as a character is ironically pretty….hollow ( lmao ), the art is good, but backgrounds are often neglected detail ( not necessarily a negative, maybe a stylistic choice ), too many filler if you’re anime only ( this problem was huge back when bleach was being made, not necessarily going to hold that against it, that was much more of an industry problem, however if you don’t skip them it still greatly hurts the experience besides a few arcs ), no character goal or motivation seems to have much nuance in this story ( with a few exceptions ), I listed most of what I think the negatives of bleach are. I could make the same list of things that I think are F***ING AWESOME, about bleach as well. Bleach has a soundtrack and it’s absolutely amazing, they have a new style for almost every encounter and it’s beautiful. I find myself listening to this OST while playing video games, working out, or doing anything where I want to feel energy from music, it’s legitimately brilliant. Bleach also has a very cool character design. Most parts of this anime are simply and entirely infused with swagger. There’s no better way to put it, bleach in many aspects is just f***ing cool. Even if something doesn’t make sense, they make it seems like the coolest thing you might ever witness. It definitely helps bleach and its shortcomings to at the very least have it appear bad ass even when on its low points. The characters while fairly simple, are extremely charismatic. It’s easy to be charmed by the cast relatively quickly. Bleach can get very brutal and is themed in a really dark manner. There are many instances that bleach feels lifeless and hopeless and it does this theme well. It makes it all the more tense and much more gut wrenching when seeing the afterlife’s only protectors in a crisis. All the more triumphant when they win as well. The bleakness of bleach can be its strength, but also a weakness. It plays back into everyone feeling relatively one dimensional along with there seemingly being no goals or purpose beyond the threats that arise ( which you know, fair enough that’s their purpose in a sense ). All in all, I like bleach. It’s a time investment so that’s something to consider, but I personally enjoyed this anime enough for what it is. By no means is it perfect or even near my favorites, but I will always remember it. Many things that commence in this show are absolutely iconic. It will have its ups and downs if you do choose to watch it, that’s something to be fully prepared for. I would say that there are better shonen out there, however bleach has a specific flavor that I’ve never seen replicated. For that and that alone, I appreciate it as an anime very much. I think how you feel about this series solely depends on a few things. 1. How much or how important are the things I just mentioned to you? 2. What do you value out of bleach or in other words, what did you come in expecting to get out of the series. 3. Were the spectacular parts of bleach enough to have you thoroughly enjoying the manga/anime through to the end? 4. ( this is an important one ) How much do you like shonen as a genre to begin with? I can tell you right now, someone who hates shonen will hate this show. While watching and reading, it began to feel like to me, many shonen traits and popular tropes I’ve seen mimicked throughout the years must’ve came partially from bleach. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it was kind of funny to realize during my time consuming it. Either way, love or hate the series, bleach seems to be a show and manga that is polarizing to an extent. Some people may love it, some may hate it, some may think it’s meh. All have perfectly valid reasons for feeling each way, I truly believe it all depends on your own personal value system with this anime. Thank you for reading. I tried to be fair, concise and straightforward, nothing too complex to write about. Hopefully I accomplished that and also gave new and old viewers alike a broader perspective of bleach as a whole. I would encourage new readers/viewers to take what I said to heart and really consider if they want to continue with watching it. At least for me, when I have a large time investment in an anime or really anything, I want to feel like it’ll be worth it as I’m sure most others do as well. The “ worth it “ aspect of bleach will depend on how you feel about everything I mentioned. BUT hey…at least if you watch it you can say you’ve seen one of the big three :) . It’s a huge foundation of the industry, so it’s cool to at least try out. Maybe give it a chance and see if it’s for you.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 7, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_936e0326d3,4,5431
"Bleach gets a lot of hate but, I just love how long the series was, getting to know all the characters and traveling through the plot with the different characters. This anime made you love the bad guy, see the evil character's perspective and almost feel bad for them. You could vividly see which character you relate well with, because there are a TON of them. I loved the uniqueness behind each character and the overall world that Bleach presents. if you are looking for great art, Bleach is not really one to present that. If you are not willing to commit to some filler episode that really make no absolute sense, Bleach is not for you. Same if you don't like the idea of an OP main character. But, if you are looking for bomb soundtrack (I own about every song) this is your anime. if you like action and fighting, this is your stop.

"First thing's first...this is some of the worse English dubbing I've heard since the early-mid 80's dubs (not counting Naruto&hellip;which shall not be mentioned again)....there....it needed said. Characters have been altered dramatically and in many cases ruined by the &ldquo;voice actor&rsquo;s&rdquo; work. That being said &ndash; this review is solely for the original Japanese Audio version. This is a reasonably fair adaptation of the source manga &ndash; however my watching the show first made my bias pretty clear in its favor. Great characters, fun interactions, and a nicely progressive story keep my interest high in this show. Rather than ranting how Kenny, Ichimaru, Urahara, or &hellip; well any of the many superb characters are great &ndash; or how endlessly amusing the Zanpakto system is I will instead say the only two beefs I have with this show. Number 1 &ndash; whoever made this show sold their soul to know when to put in cliffhangers. So far I believe the series has consisted of 3 or 4 episodes linked by a hundred+ &ldquo;to be continued&rdquo; screens. Now granted this is awesome for suspense and keeping you hooked like an addict &ndash; but when you catch up and have to wait with everyone else it can get bug you from time to time. Number 2 &ndash; &lsquo;Special Edition&rsquo; story arcs. This manga was popular enough that the show was made quickly and often. However, this has created complete story arcs of pseudo-filler because the show caught up with the manga. The entire Bounto/Bound/(however you want to say it) saga? Technical Fluff&hellip;.fun fluff&hellip;.but fluff none the less. Luckily the writers play with this with constant references of &ldquo;does this have anything to do with X?&rdquo; &ldquo;No&hellip;not a thing&rdquo; &ndash; ending the saga with a &ldquo;Why&hellip;yes&hellip;.yes it does!&rdquo; The current story arc at the time of this review occurring after a fight with Grimjow, came out of left field so quickly I pictured Rocky coming out with his little blue goggles to say &ldquo;Now here&rsquo;s something we hope you really like!! Something completely different!&rdquo; This show is very fun and I&rsquo;d highly recommend it &ndash; taking the fun swordplay from Kenshin and the absurd abilities and power levels from Dragonball Z. It successfully takes only the good from each, burning the rest, and tossing in its own little blend of fun. Oh...and expect ULTRA-DIEGETIC music throughout.

"Storyline In my own opinion, Bleach has one of the most captivating pilot(first) episodes I have ever seen. The storyline itself is also very intriguing and quite fascinating. The mix of action and comedy is exquisitely implemented and each episode almost always ends on a high note. The only negative comment I have is on all the useless filler episodes that are scattered throughout the series and the one filler arc (bounto arc). Art My overall impression of the art is satisfying. And on certain episodes you can really see they took out all the stops, making it a spectacular feast for the eyes. As the anime progresses, the animation quality and character designs for the most part does also. Sound The sound is good and I must say I am quite fond of their musical score, which significantly helps build up the atmosphere. Character Since this is an ongoing anime, they have ample opportunities to expand on character profiles and backgrounds, which they execute almost perfectly. Overall You only have to ask yourself why Bleach is one of the most popular anime series at the moment. It&rsquo;s a blend of action, comedy, a great plot and interesting characters.",9,Recommended,"Nov 22, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5a284803b6,4,1169
"Story: You can see how the story of Bleach has captivated a large majority of those that watch anime. It’s a fantasy of many; to be transformed from a regular guy to a hero with a badass sword. Being very shounen, it echoes the characteristics of other popular anime such as DBZ, where the excitement comes from exceeding limits in power and beating ridiculously strong opponents - against all odds. Unfortunately (for us), Bleach has fallen into a large and highly populated pitfall where this story is not masterfully told. At all. It is a long, drawn out filler poop-fest with plot holes and some irritatingly predictable twists along the way. The fantasy wanted to watch is spoiled with every episode and is way too drawn out for you to care in the end. Overall, the fact that the story is so spread out across so many episodes is the flaw that makes it so bad. It doesn’t feel intense and the climatic parts of the story just don’t arouse the way they should. Characters: Most of the time the characters felt 2-D. It felt like I was watching an anime which made it a mostly painful experience. Don't get me wrong, I don't want a sob story all the time but I didn't feel connected I guess. Nonetheless, not all character development in Bleach is pants. There are definitely some characters that make you interested in the plot and its eventual conclusion but generally, this is spread very thin across its 300+ eps. Mostly, the interesting characters are the ones that are shrouded in mystery thus generating the appeal. Others are just too cool for you to dislike but that leaves you with a very shallow set of characters. It isn’t enough to keep you entertained for the amount of episodes that there are. Art / Animation: Absolutely freaking shite. It is so bad. You would think that an anime with poor character development and an under-emphasis on the story would have some epic fight sequences but no. It really doesn't. Most episodes are filled with still images with shoddy layering techniques, they are constantly re-using animations, there is minimal expression and low (and sometimes absolutely no) movement - even in fight scenes!! It makes it boring and incredibly hard to watch - honestly. It is shockingly bad animation for an anime (",3,Not Recommended,"Jul 22, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f18919dad6,4,2252
"Really, where to start from with Bleach? Because there are many good and many foul things about this anime... Let's start from the good ones though. First of all, I liked the art; I loved how the characters were created, they were fluid, flawless and realistic, as if they were dancing with their swords during all their epic battles. Then after, the music was spectacular. I always notice the background music, it is a very important part of the excitement and development of an anime and I believe Bleach creators nailed it. A mix of powerfulness, anticipation, emotion, sadness, pain, fear, those tracks had everything, every single one of them individually. Great job on that. Now for the plot; well, to be totally honest, I have mixed feelings about the plot. The idea is good, really good but there are plenty of flaws and holes in the way. I absolutely loved the first arc with Soul Society, as it gave me an insight of the characters personal worlds, helped me understand who is who and what he/she is capable of, all the stories and pains each character - major or minor - carried upon their shoulders... In general, the first arc kept me on the very edge and then surprised the hell out of me (not going to spoil here), so I can tell I enjoyed it 100%. Now for the rest of the anime... The rest was kinda boring, to put it simply. Okay, yes, there were some epic battles, some cool pep-talk, some deep words of friendship and companionship, supporting your friends, saving your friends, saving everybody in general - that's Ichigo ladies and gentlemen; the boy is the incarnation of utter sacrifice. I think that's why he is so popular with the viewers, including me - but all these things were dragged out for too long. Especially the unimportant blabbering during the battles, which ended up killing all the thrill and epicness about them. Plus, the second arc with the Espadas and Hueco Mundo was almost like the Soul Society arc, only that we didn't have Shinigami but Hollows to fight. Let's just say that I mentally skip the ever-going talk during the battles and reach the final battle, the big boss, badass transformations from both Ichigo and the final boss, yeah okay. But that was it. Nothing too remarkable about it, the wow factor non-existing. I think, Bleach would be a better anime if it stopped there because, yes, it continues. As a big fan, I watched it nonstop until the Hueco Mundo arc ended. Then after, I simply couldn't finish it, so boring it was. Again, these endless talk-battles, where the characters did more talking than fighting, the plot growing confusing and fragmented - a huge no-no for me. New characters and new skills introduced, skills that were of none importance in the very end. Apparently Tite Kubo wanted to stuff his characters with more and more ""experience"", to show how ultimate Ichigo's power is but bottom line is... He achieved nothing but me yawning. Which of course brings my focus to the characters only. There are so many characters in this anime, I don't even know where to begin from. And each one has to have his/her own stage time, no matter how useless or minor he/she is. I understand that a good mangaka doesn't leave his secondary characters unattended but the problem is that none of the characters had some sort of development, no matter how long his/hers stage time was. Not even Ichigo developed, who is supposed to be the main character. Yes, he got stronger, yes he got better at fighting, learnt a lot about himself but for me, that was almost insignificant because it happened too quickly, from one day to the other. His badass-ness and cockiness stayed until the very end (which is good), his stubbornness too, but all I can say is that he simply matured and got prettier. Nothing important in that. I think, there were two characters that showed some form of development before Kubo decided to cease their growth and bam, kick them to the ground again. These two were Renji and Gin. The rest of the hundred thousand characters in this story, were neutral, with no significant role except their fandom. Not that I don't like the rest of the characters, that's not it; it's just that Kubo wanted to focus on each of them separately, spending way too much of our time. That's what makes Bleach boring in a way. What you should also be aware of: this anime has A LOT of fillers. I'm not even going to go there in much detail. Just skip them, for your own good and once you've finished the actual story, if you're curious, watch them. Be prepared to yawn, I know I did. I give this story an overall 8 and I know that it doesn't correspond to all the bad things I've mentioned above but it is worth watching. Why? Because I strongly believe that there are many things behind every event and character, many ideas and messages they want to pass to the viewer/reader and that is mainly why I gave the anime 8. It shows how important friendship and support are, strength, not only physical but mental also, refers to maternal love, paternal love, as well as sacrifice, betrayal, loyalty, trust, pain and suffering and how easily these can be transformed into power... I think I'm missing a lot, but for a first glance, that's about it. I hope my review was helpful to you.

"Bleach huh. :) The story is amazing. When I watch this anime, I allways get blown away in any possible way. The guy who wrote this manga, I admire him, because of him I can watch Bleach today. I keep thinking about the picture, if he only improvises or if everything is planned. That is really amazing that he actually can make so many people happy with this anime/manga. In times it is very serious but suddenly go totally out of line. It makes you laugh to the greatest extent and the caracters are so amusing.

"My first review! I watched the anime right up until one of the ""climax"" arcs, the war *minor spoiler* between the shinigami captain and the godmode villian, Aizen. I read the manga right up till the fullbring arc, then dropped the entire thing in disgust. I can't rmb how many episodes of bleach i've watched, but will just give an arbitrary figure of 100. The beginning of the story was interesting, it was good enough to hook you as an audience and keep you interested in the plot, albeit the typical save the girl was at play here, there were many interesting characters, like ever-grinning ichimaru gin, resourceful mentor urahara kisuke and badass kenpachi. then the initial arc climaxed at the reveal of a powerful villain before heading straight into the arrancar and vizard arcs, which were still good. The storyline begins to plummet after the fight with ulquiorra, the fights with the top 3 espada were very disappointing, and needless to say, the godmodding with aizen after is just..... speechless. beyond that, the fullbring arc was absolute nonsense and after that, the quincy arc just seems, rushed, like he had no better way to end the story. If Kubo ended the story after the war, (minus fullbring and blood war arcs) it would have gotten a higher score, but as it stands, the manga is now downright terrible. Art is good, which is pretty much the reason why i bother (most of it, anyway). Characters were run of the mill, and overall enjoyment went from a score of 8-7 at agent of the shinigami/rescue rukia to 7-6 at the arrrancar arc, then plummeted to 5-4 thereafter. it dropped to 3 at the point i dropped it, which was the fullbring arc.",3,Not Recommended,"May 26, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e6396a283e,4,1660
"personally, Bleach was my gateway anime (that sounds a little weird). A major complaint bleach gets is all of the filler, this is due sourly to shonen jump wanting more money. As far as filler goes, its mostly limited in the non-canon seasons, but all you have to do is skip the filler seasons, unless you want to watch a ""what if"" story of bleach. STORY: ""All the arcs are just the same"" that is said by people who fvcking nit-pick at everything. Sure bleach's first 2 events involve someone getting kidnapped, going to a new world, and ichigo gains a new power. BUT the story's are unique to each other, due to HOW and WHY they begin and resolve. Kubo (the author) cant help to make multi-worlds, due to bleaech being based off of the Buddhism, which involves multi-worlds, and he cant just show off 2 worlds ( human world and world of the gods) and let everything be ""been there done that"". Now to deal with ichigo gaining new power every new season....SO DOES ALMOST EVERY OTHER SUPER ACTION CHARACTER DOES, like goku (who is fvcking beloved, and makes powers on the spot) and naruto CHARACTERS: In the very beginning of bleach, you get this small group of characters, whose background you'll never know,BUT that's ok, because no one gives a sh!t about them, and their in there for only a few episodes character development is pretty good, most characters who you'll gonna give a sh!t about have a background. But for some characters you wont see for a while. Some characters backstory have only been shown in the latest chapter of the manga. The main character, ichigo, is your classic ""ill protect my friends"" guy but hes truly a lovable character due other aspects of his personalty. Such as fighting against any opponent even if he knows that they can kick his @ss, not in a ""wanna fight"" way, but more of a ""i wont give up"" way FIGHTING: The action scenes are awesome, high speed sword fights. But don't worry, not all of the fights are just sword fighting, once you get later on in the series, you'll start to see more of the characters unique powers. SOUND/ART: In bleach's early production, the sound/art were not very good, but just hang in there till it becomes better over the following seasons. Its like how DBZ started, bad sound and art, but that was just how things were during its time. ENJOYMENT: I personally enjoyed it very well. its still one the anime where I re-watch fights Some people say this is a rip of Yuyu Hakusho, for no other reason other than it resolves around spirits. But really the plot/story's have very few similar traits. Overall, the anime is pretty great. Miner plot holes. The main protagonist is one of those great role models, like goku and naruto are, like they teach lessons to fight for your friends and never give up, no matter how hard life hits you.

"This is my first review, so I apologize if I happen to make a few mistakes. But I had first came across bleach a long time ago when it was shown on Adult Swim, but i decided to re-watch from the beginning back in 2013, & boy I'm glad I did. If you want an action packed, funny, and adventurous plot, then this is a show you should watch. Now, this is just my opinion, but Bleach has to be one of the best action anime to date. Now, I'm sure I don't have to give a summary on what the show is about since one is already given for you but if I had to rate all the factors that make up this anime the score would be these: Story: 8/10 There are various arcs in Bleach, but they are good ones. Now the main story has to be one of the best stories I've watched so far. It kept me on the edge of my seat because I wanted to know what was going to happen. At times it is quite predictable but it doesn't make it boring at all. Art: 7/10 Because Bleach released back in 2004, the art wasn't so great but as it got more into the later years the art became quite good. Sound: 10/10 It has some of the best openings and endings ever. Many of my favorite songs are from the Bleach soundtrack, so you won't be disappointed at all with the sound. Character: 9/10 You see some pretty decent character development in here, as well as some cool as hell characters as well. Enjoyment: 10/10 I don't think reasons are needed for this area. Overall: 9/10 Bleach does have its flaws, I must admit, but it is one of my all time favorites and did not disappoint me one bit. But this is all my own opinion. With Bleach and with every other anime you should never go in with high hopes nor low hopes because you may be surprised. But, give Bleach a shot if you haven't already, although it is one of the most known anime. WATCH IT.",9,Recommended,"Aug 8, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9c633a917f,5,1806
"This is my first review so bare with me a bit please. I chose bleach as my first review because out of the ""big 4"" it is by far my favorite. ~Story~ The story aspect of bleach is amazing. Who doesn't like an underdog facing impossible odds to pull off a win at the last second? this series has a habit of making you angry but then gives you the satisfaction of witnessing the revenge that you hoped for during the build up of each arc. My overall rating for the story is 9.5/10. As badass as the individual arcs are they have a tendency to repeat over and over. ~Art~ The artwork was generic at best near the beginning of the series but as it goes on the artwork gets much better. Usually during fight scenes, anime has a tendency to lose a lot of the details in the characters themselves but bleach always keeps it consistant. I give the artwork a 10/10. ~Sound~ Great music! The sound is great and the timing of it used to create an emotional response is dead on every time. ~character~ The characters in bleach are diverse and support each other nicely. The MC develops relationships with a large group that never seems to stop growing. The MC has a hero complex and has to save everyone from everything by himself and eventually caves to the idea of help. You have the thunders type of personality in Rukia. Dandere personality in orihime. Then you have the rival and the best friend that join his party to complete the group. Overall I say the diversity in the members of this main group of friends makes the show that much more enjoyable. ~Enjoyment~ The enjoyment on this series is a solid 10/10. I'm a big fan of the shonen genre and they did everything right in this anime. Great plot, characters, and superpowers. I think if you're interested in the shonen genre than this anime would be a great pick. There's a dash of romance but they keep it down low so don't expect too much if you're more into that. Overall I give this anime my #1 slot in my all time favorites and its a series I can still to this day watch over and over from beginning to end and never get sick of it. I hope this review helps you in some way.

"Bleach really knows how to do an Anime right if it wants to, problem is...Most times it chooses not to. In its prime, Bleach is literally second to none. It gets its viewer hyped like no other anime I have seen. It has an amazing soundtrack as a tool to get people hyped. It also has amazing fighting scenes that trumps most other long running Anime out there. It also has amazing characters, there will a character that will be enjoyable to any viewer. Problem is, these beautiful moments that I just described only come after enduring all its annoying qualities. It drags out an episode just too long, it makes a viewer wait and wait and wait, until when you think you can't bear it anymore, it hits you with pure awesomeness. Although some could argue that that is what makes those epic moments much more epic. It also has annoying fillers which is not really a problem as far as you search it up on google and skip them.

"I'm going to warn you. The anime completely disappointed me so if you haven't seen it yet and you're expecting it to be really good (like I did - my best friend's fault. I should never again trust her recommendations in anime and movies), this review is going to make you think twice. I mean it. The anime ticked me off BIG time. Of the three points I gave this anime, one point would go to the opening and closing songs (hee); another point would go to the characters that I like (one guy with a green hat who trained the protagonist, the cool antagonist, the white haired boy); and the last point would go to the only episode that I appreciated out of the 45 episodes I watched - EPISODE 1. UUUUGH! What is wrong with this anime??? I mean really?! Such a waste of time! If I wasn't so bored, I wouldn't even - ehem. Sorry. Moving on... Episode 1 pretty much gives a summary of what the movie is all about: a guy who can see ghosts is given the powers of a Death God so that he could kill the bad spirits (called 'hollows') that kill good spirits. I thought that the anime was going to be interesting because the plot sounded new to me. I mean, ""Death God?"", ""sixth sense?"" Yeah, that pretty much persuaded me. As the anime progressed, however, the story was starting to become typical and boring. Not to mention that there were SO MANY unnecessary flashbacks and SO MANY darned scenes that should have been removed (e.g. 30 seconds of watching a character roll on the ground after getting hit by an enemy, a minute of watching a character swish his sword). I mean come on!! I kept forwarding it 75% of the time. It was like a badly made indie indie (redundancy’s intentional) film. What I hated the most about the anime was the protagonist. No it’s not the typical goody-goody, martyr, sweet antagonist girl that I hate. In fact, it's a guy with characteristics that are usually something I can stand. What I couldn't bear about him is how the he's supposed to be someone with SOOOO much talent and SOOOO much power that he's almost SOOOO perfect. Don't get me wrong. I love fiction and I do day dream about impossible stuff AND I am a perfectionist. But, really now, a protagonist who can perfect a technique in three days when it's supposed to be perfected in a 100 years by ""even the most talented"" (quotation from the film)?? A protagonist who's never really been beaten by anybody?? It's SO annoying! And SO unrealistic! And SO urgh!! Wasn't Lelouche beaten by his brother at some point? Wasn't Naruto beaten by Sasuke at some point? Wasn't Ban sliced by some guy at some point? Weren't 4 of the 7 samurais killed? Whew. I really had to get that off my chest. X) All in all, the anime sucks. No offense to whoever made it X) but I hardly ever stop midway when watching an anime. This was the first time that I really lost interest and didn't care about how much I spent on the DVD.

"Oh Boy! Another over 130+ episode anime, with pointless scenes, and unnecessary humor. Great, just great. The plot.. what plot is what I am wondering. While watching this, every so often I found myself questioning this, or when I read other reviews on different websites. There really was no plot, other than a 15 year old boy, in school being able to see ghosts and become a soul reaper. To be all honest I didn't even see the plot in this, it felt more like an episodic anime with no plot at all. The first episode was rather boring, and just lead up to what others would call a breath taking transformation. Breath taking really, I think not. It was rather dull and un impressive. I had to role my eyes at yet another Sailor Moon reminder (without the fancy music or dance). The second episode was a bit better but still I saw no plot to this series. 'sighs' The is a disappoint ment to me. As the show progressed I started to lack in memory of the series. Due to my ability to block out any boring or dull movie scenes, it was an automatic switch on for this series. I didn't like it and the plot seemed to run more on the action and humor instead of itself. There was no real ending so far, just more prologue. Art (Animation)- If you guys no me well, you know I pay a bit more attention to the art instead of the characters or plot, seeing as the english voice cast has away to ruin that for me (unless I am watching subs, I can consentrate more on what is going on with them). Where as many would say that the art was fantastic, or very good.. I say that it seriously lacked. I saw no real creativity for this, not even in the manga itself did I see creativity. The soul, a blue fire ball. It seemed more like light blue paint that they made glow and move. Action scenes with spiritual powers.. also another site of sqlaushed paint being formed into something. I would say the ice of Hitsugiya was probably the only creative thing I seen in the show concerning art. The background now was way to bright, like a Spring Break party. Where it tired to show something gloomy or tragic it failed somewhat, but they did manage to capture rain and clouds right. Character art wasn't so good either. Like Naruto, when a character either gets bruised or has a small cut it would heal quickly without cause. Only major damage showed, pathetic. Hair styles, limbs, and tones could have been better also. I am being rather generous with rating sound a five. Mostly because of the song choices and the not too bad voice cast for this. The songs for the series, though they had a good beat and were somewhat rememberable, it did not match the series at all. Rare cases like Kuroshitsuji's soundtrack actually fit and flow with the story as if it belonged, but most cases like Bleach it was just put there to show off the series. Apperantly, in this case you run good on soundtrack you tend to have a bit more fans.. Nothing of real interest to the songs, a good soundtrack but nothing relating to the series. Voice cast.. now I mind you that I do not watch this on dvds or youtube. I am stuck with AdultSwim and watching it every Saturday, so yes.. I am reviewing for the enlgish dub. How unfortunate. Thankfully, Viz didn't do too bad with it, I felt that though some of the voice actors like JYB didn't fit the roles correctly some did. It wasn't too bad to where you'd hate listening to it, but you can get annoyed by it at times. So it is watchable, I just suggest you be careful before doing so. Characters.. now people are going to hate me for this, I just know it. One charater out of all of them stood out for me.. and that was Orhime. Now before anyone curses me out, let me explain to you this. Orhime, had these god like abilities and yet instead of going into that they skipped over her like a rag doll in garbage. Ouch. Not only that, but I notice (and another person notice as well) that the enter series consentrated more on the males instead of the females. Useless characters I would have to say, seeing as they only put them there for show. How rude is that... I mean you have these amazing girls here, that probably have more power than they show and they are skipped over. What in the world happened I was wondering. Oh and the males.. most of the male characters seem to just stand around and do nothing where as Ichigo bothers to do something about any problem. I mean come on.. all these characters seemed nothing but sueish or stuish to me.. and it hurt me to feel that the series was like a statement that females are only good for their looks. If any anti-club there should notice it was not the girls fault for what the staff did it is the staff and mangaka that ruined their chances. I can't help but rate them a 3.. just poor. Poor development, poor attitudes, and the majority of useless characters. This just irritated me. My enjoyment a three. I found my enjoyment seriously lacking in this series. I was not impressed by the action or attempts at being funny. I was not impressed by the characters, sound, etc. Really, I was just like a china doll staring at the screen. Though I should probably rate it lower if it where that bad, I did find some things rather funny like the blood being thrown at the wall and writting itself. I couldn't help but laugh, or any time Mr. Hat and Clogs came up. Overall.. a 3.4 (3 here). I could not like this series.. not with the serious lack of creativity, anti-female feel, episodic feel, and lack of plot.. just a serious lack of everything. My advise to the staff would be stop and change it. The manga is feeling the same so I am not surprised by this.

"I'm a huge anime fan and I think Bleach is one of the anime that touched me the most. I often watch all the episodes, especially the cult scenes and I can tell you that he teaches us lots of things. It teaches us that even if we are in difficult situations, we can always get out of it and that we must never give up. It also teaches us that friendship is something important and that we must take care of it. Certainly, someone with power does not exist in our worlds, but it makes us dream. I accept that there are episodes that are not ""epic"", but that does not prevent the fact that this anime is excellent. Regarding the story he tells, I admit that from time to time, it is not logical and that there are certain things which are better to correct. As for the fights, there isn't much to say except that these are intense fights and to see that Ichigo never gives up no matter what, it melts my heart.

"The Bleachverse actually takes itself seriously, It honestly was a breath of fresh air compared to other shonen. Ichigo is the only Shonen protagonist who actually shows fear, throughout the series he's constantly reminded that he's weak or not the strongest by his opponents and in some cases isn't afraid to run or retreat. Bleach was such a unique series that actually felt like it was written for teens and at times felt a little more mature, And the music was amazing from its OSTs to the openings, (Chefs Kiss). (Flaws): Unfortunately, Bleach lost most of its momentum because of filler but primarily after the Sousuke Aizen arc. Bleach as a series had such rich and unique characters, but unfortunately, we don't get to see them a lot because the series loved focusing on boring and forgettable characters (sometimes it's done right tho). Furthermore, the Bleach Anime doesn't look like it's coming back and it's a shame since we got such a lacklustre anime-only ending. Man, can they please finish the anime properly the manga is well ahead and ending soon...",8,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_83f8b6cd69,5,1067
"*I did not watch any filler* Bleach is a show that I never thought I would watch, and never thought I would enjoy if I ever did watch, but watching this show was a great choice. There are so many good things about this show that I love, the characters, music, plot, story, fights, and so much more. The best part is that even after watching just this, I can watch the TYBW episodes next, and Ive heard they are even better. The music in the show is just amazing. It is done perfectly in every episode, certain music play for certain scenes and all played appropriate to the situation or whatevers going on in the show, that doesnt even start on how great it is though. As far as I know most of the music in the show was made by Shiro Sagisu, so you can assume its going to be perfect already. There are so many tracks in the soundtrack that have me thinking ""god damn this is just peak"" One noteable track is the theme of Ichigo, Number One, I believe you first hear it on the first episode of the show, and at first I didnt know how good it was until it was played next, the song is always played whenever you know Ichigo is about to go crazy in a fight, and I get hyped for it every single time. Another big thing about the music in the show is the openings and endings, although not really important to the actual episodes I still gotta comment on them, a lot of them are amazing, a lot of them are alright, but there arent really any terrible ones, the music for this show has been done so great. My favorite opening is still the first one and my favorite ending is the second one. Honorable mention, the Vizard theme escalon is freaking awesome too, just love that song so much. Something about the hype I feel when watching this show in multiple scenes, when a character gets a powerup I freak out, when a random character I like shows up, I freak out, when a character I love shows up for the 100th time I freak out, I may be stupid, but this show is just peak for that reason. One more note, I watched the first movie, but I still gotta watch the rest, the first one was pretty good. Anyways, im really happy I watched the show, was very worth it.",9,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_37946c184d,5,2155

The characters personalities, some are used a lot in other animes, but still good none the less. I'm always waiting to see the next episode as of right now.

"Bleach is a great anime in too many ways. It has has great fighting scenes and very unique characters. The comedy is great and the storyline will leave you begging for the next episode to come. However there are flaws like it uses the same music often for the fight scenes and in my opinion not the best choice. It also has a handful of filler episodes which can get rather bothersome at times. If you have the patience for it you will really enjoy it.

"Bleach was my first (subbed) anime, so I will always have a soft spot for it. It started out strongly and got me hooked... within days, I was already 70 episodes in (something I never do). Things start falling apart later on though. This anime has more gaping plotholes than any other in recent memory, and there are plenty of missed opportunities in the storyline. Things that seemed inevitable and natural did not transpire the way one assumed (or hoped) they would. I cannot elaborate due to spoilers, but I think most fans would agree. Regardless of that Bleach has some of the most entertaining combat you're likely to find in anime, and some superbly designed characters, and a gorgeous aesthetic. And a good story, for a while. Beware of the painful filler episodes, but I guess that's natural for an anime that ran as long as Bleach.",10,Recommended,"Feb 12, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_07fa9da7e1,5,841
"Bleach. It's big. It's japanese. It's avaliable subbed. It's dubbed. It's every-freakin where. And it has an anime. Said anime will be reviewed... now. Story- 7 Wow. The absolutely only way you're ever going to completely follow and get the storyline, plot, and references, you MUST begin with episode 1. The story's that expansive, but that doesn't mean it's perfect. With trying to tell six or seven stories in one episode most times, and the hit-or-miss filler episode consisting of the usual antics in the real world, I would really have to push to call it anything other than good. Art- 8 This is not Ghost in the Shell-type anime, but damned if it doesn't come close. Animations are fluid, effects are appropriate, and character movement is smooth, not jarred and forced. Sound- 6 The sound is varyingly diverse and interesting, but I swear I hear the same music every four episodes or so. You're 125 and over in, maybe it's time to record a few new songs? Character- 6 There have been very few, if at all animes I've seen with SO MANY main characters. Every single character you see (Besides news reporters and regular townsfolk) has a story to tell, and you must (Or be forced to) hear it. And trying to juggle so many character developments, especially in one episode alone, is an out there thing to do. Enjoyment- 8 Let's not mix words- this is a one to keep an eye on. Being a runaway freight train in Japan and starting to hit home in the US on Adult Swim, Bleach is becoming vastly popular quickly. But the features aren't good enough to follow like a religion (which you shouldn't do in the first place). Overall-7 Looking past the balancing act of characters, and the same music every time, Bleach is an enjoyable experience. Just don't devote lives to it.",7,Recommended,"Oct 30, 2007",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_dce1e7bbd0,5,1771
"This anime starts out good, and then sucks a lot later on. Towards the end of the Soul Society arc, everything goes downhill. The story starts to get repetitive and overrun with filler, and character development progressively gets more stale. The artwork and sound effects are of great quality however, and the story isn't too terrible before the Soul Society arc ends. As the anime is right now however, fight scenes and other forms of story progression all take too long, often spanning over what seems like a dozen episodes. All in all, I would highly advise against wasting time to watch the entire anime. The story progresses too slowly, and it's nothing special.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 16, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_962423a02b,5,668
"Bleach burst onto the scene with its compelling premise and dynamic characters, experiences a notable shift in quality after the exhilarating Soul Society arc. While the series maintains elements of its initial brilliance, the subsequent arcs struggle to recapture the same magic, resulting in a narrative that becomes more average than exceptional. The early episodes of Bleach shine brightest during the Soul Society arc. The stakes are high, character development is robust, and the intricate plot twists keep viewers on the edge of their seats. This arc not only establishes the foundation of the series but also showcases the potential for greatness. One notable downfall comes in the form of pacing issues and an abundance of filler episodes. Post-Soul Society, the narrative often loses its focus, meandering through less impactful storylines. This not only disrupts the flow of the main plot but also dilutes the intensity and urgency established in the earlier arcs. The later arcs witness a dilution of the series' core themes. The intricate exploration of the afterlife and the consequences of interfering with spiritual realms, which was a strong aspect in the early arcs, takes a backseat as the narrative becomes more entangled in battles and power struggles. While some characters continue to evolve, others suffer from stagnant development or, in some cases, undergo abrupt transformations that may not align with their established personalities. This inconsistency in characterization can lead to a sense of detachment from certain characters. The main protagonist - Ichigo's primary evolution is often confined to his fighting abilities. While his prowess in battles escalates, the personal and emotional facets of his character development remain overshadowed by the relentless focus on combat. This imbalance diminishes the opportunity for a more holistic exploration of Ichigo's character. On a positive note, the animation quality remains consistently spectacular throughout the series. The fluidity of fight sequences and the meticulous attention to character designs contribute to the visual appeal that keeps viewers invested in the later arcs despite narrative shortcomings. Bleach remains a nostalgic journey for many fans, including I, who were captivated by its early brilliance. However, the anime's subsequent arcs fail to sustain the same level of excellence. The transition from exceptional to average leaves a lingering sense of what could have been, as viewers witness a series with immense potential not fully realized. Bleach holds a special place in the hearts of many for its gripping Soul Society arc and the initial promise it displayed. However, the subsequent arcs struggle to maintain the same level of quality, with pacing issues, repetitive tropes, and a dilution of core themes detracting from the overall experience. Despite its flaws, Bleach continues to be a beloved part of anime history, with its early brilliance acting as a testament to the heights the series once achieved. Bleach Soul Society Arc: 10/10. A must watch - at least until the conclusion of Soul Society Arc. Post Soul Society Arc: 6/10.",7,Recommended,"Dec 8, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a3e8bad8bb,5,3155
"Having grown up in Japan, its amazing to me still that I did not immerse myself in the manga culture until I left the country. Bleach is what is considered a mainstream ""shonen anime"" along with Naruto which you probably already have heard of. From what I have heard - giving Bleach a try is the best decision I have made. If you want the short answer to what my review is, this show is a good one. The plot of Bleach is pretty easy to grasp in the beginning. There are Soul Reapers who have the ability to guide souls to the Soul Society which is an afterlife dimension. Reapers not only guide human souls but combat evil spirits to protect everyone. On initial watch, you meet Ichigo the arrogant sarcastic teenage boy (typical character). The first season introduces us to the most important of characters, Rukia and allows us to understand the basic concept of Bleach as we know it. We don't realize until the end the new events that will cause us to go on rescue missions to defend the Soul Society. Finally after the first 50+ episodes a climax takes place and makes the entire season worth watching. But, 50 episodes in - who has the attention span to watch this? Continuing on you are promised great rewards at the end of this brick road. Two arcs are a slow paced action anime which is the issue I've had with it. The Soul Society arc grabs your attention and asks you to be a loyal fan, until its interest plummets. While the Arrancar arc is interesting in new aspects, neither that or the Hueco Mundo arc do much for the senses. Like most cartoons these days, the plot doesn't thicken past the save the damsel in distress mode, and gets old. Many of the repeat fights don't have much oomph to them as we must see the same scenes over again. Aside from the filler, the reusing of plots and damsel in distress Bleach did show an increasing in potential as we dive deeper into the series. The universe comes alive in new ways, and Bleach improves as it matures. The other seasons are not as good as season 1, and leaves your yearning for more. Oddly enough Bleach is still enjoyable to watch even having finished it already. The true excitement is that with every rerun you find something new about the show. You inspect powers of each character, what motivates the villain of each episode and the quirks of the characters. The true spark of this show is in fact the cast, the odd twists and behaviors keeps you coming back for more. Even when the animation fades in and out between low frames and odd character interaction, its still beautiful to watch. What also sparks the imagination to Bleach's claim to fame is their Soundtrack. Each one brings new sound, and revives the old. The tone of each episode is followed closely and does not miss a beat in action and underlying electric tone. I've said this over and over to friends who don't watch anime, watch this one first- give it a few episodes and you'll watch it to the end.",8,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b16727e899,5,2940

"NOTE: There will only be a few spoilers in this review, but I'll be as minimal as humanly possible. I only got to episode 94 before I dropped the series. I'll try not to go into details where appropriate to avoid spoilers. So I used to really enjoy watching Bleach when it was new and just starting to air on Adult Swim late Saturday night years ago. I saw the first episode and found myself hooked, and as each week passed, I would watch an episode. I really liked how the series was pacing along with its initial episodes. Eventually I started to watch the subbed episodes online and still enjoyed it, but then I realized I hit the first episode of the Soul Society Arc. That's when everything started to get bumpy for me. After that arc began, I immediately found myself dreading the storyline instead of enjoying it. The filler episodes before it started off so well, too. With the initial filler episodes, the series showed a whole lot of potential and promise in the future. I was excited for the moment that everything would really start. I was so wrong. If you must know, the Soul Society Arc starts at about episode 20, and it involves a key character being abducted and needing to be rescued from another world, the Soul Society. So I started to watch the episodes here and found myself realizing the show seemed significantly less exciting at this point. But I figured after maybe five or ten episodes, they'd wrap everything up and move onto the next big thing. After all, it was only episode 20. They'd be done soon, right? Later on to around episode 40, THE ENTIRE ARC IS STILL GOING AND STILL ISN'T FINISHED. If you think about it, most anime shows last 50 episodes before they wrap everything up, but this arc wasn't even finished. The writing gave me the impression that the author was dragging his feet and improvising the entire thing as he went along. But hey, some shows last more than 50 episodes and are still doing great, right? So I continued to watch. I end up around episode 60 and I'm just dreading how long this arc managed to be stretched out. Especially after a particularly pointless and painful filler episode (I think it was episode 50) that seemed so out of place and out of nowhere just earlier. And finally, a few episodes after 60, the arc finally comes to an unsatisfying end. That's when I realized this show had another fatal flaw that the first arc made it develop: WAY too many characters. If any of you guys are familiar with Sonic the Hedgehog, the series became a sort of mish mash of annoying secondary characters taking up space. Bleach has a similar problem, but instead of letting them all take up space, the author feels the need to develop each and every single one of them as he goes along, and at times it just feels incredibly forced. It felt like the development of all these characters was holding up the progression of the entire arc and delaying it further, when it could have ended a lot sooner otherwise. Some of them he does an okay job on developing, but other ones just seem annoying and make me wonder why they need to continue existing. But we'll touch up on that a bit more in a moment. Anyway, after the Soul Society Arc ended, it looked like a new arc was going to start, and this one looked a whole lot more promising. The first few episodes of it had me really interested, like this was going to be some kind of psychological and really clever part of the series. However, instead of being an actual arc, it ends prematurely on a very disappointing cop out, where we have several more useless characters introduced as a result. Somebody never told the creator of the series that too many cooks can spoil the broth. So anyway, there's another arc starting, the Bount Arc, and then I find the series going straight back to the feet-dragging, pointless writing of the Soul Society Arc. The arc is so boring and was absolutely painful for me to watch. So much so that most fans have told me that I should have just skipped it. But really, if I have to skip any parts of a series, that's a good indicator that it's probably not worth watching. That also raises a red flag in terms of how ineffective somebody can be at storytelling. Anyway, this arc also attempts some character development with a staple character, but I really felt like it was forced or shoehorned in. At this point in the series, I had been on and off trying to continue the series, but I slowly began to dislike it the further I went along. Eventually, I got to episode 94 and after realizing a lot of the background characters were jumping in out of nowhere to remind us they exist and act as deus ex machinas, I decided that was the last straw and dropped the series for good. I really wanted to like this series. I truly did. I enjoyed it from the beginning, and the first series intro still gives me nostalgia whenever I see it (I would go as far as saying the first intro is one of my favorite anime intros ever; I still love it to this day). But after being really promising at the beginning, the series really drops the ball when the actual story begins, and everything goes from being carefully planned out to being improvised rather poorly as time passes. Something else that always bothered me a bit about the series is the ending themes. The filler episodes at the beginning usually end on a cheery or satisfactory note, and then the ending theme is a rather sad song ""Life Is Like A Boat"". Nothing wrong with the song since I liked it, but then later during the Soul Society Arc, the juxtaposition becomes much worse and less appropriate. Several episodes during the Soul Society Arc end on dreadful cliffhangers, and the ending theme is ""HAPPY PEOPLE"", an upbeat and lively pop-ish song about being happy. Doesn't really do a good job adding to the atmosphere. Characterization is flawed as I mentioned above for having too many characters to focus on. As a result, Ichigo, the protagonist, shows little to no development, or he develops it so slowly that it doesn't matter. He develops adequately enough during the initial filler episodes as far as anime standards go, but once the Soul Society Arc begins, he becomes the walking embodiment of the generic ""get more powerful and beat them"" cliche. Any character development during the story arcs I've seen is often minimalized to give more time to lesser characters. In other words, the characterization isn't so bad, but it's just spread far too thin. So closing thoughts, the music and sound were okay in the series, but I found a lot of it forgettable or just good enough. The art is adequate, but nothing to really make your jaw drop in awe.",3,Not Recommended,"Oct 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3f55e72d49,5,6646
"Bleach, yea after watching this that's what I want right now, a big bottle of bleach so I can wash some of my clothes and try to get my mind of this train wreck. Bleach is nothing but a dubious shire twisting down a landscape of softened pathways. Do you really wanna watch bleach? I mean do you? I would like to think if you are into anime to the point of being on this site you would be aware of much better shows. The characters, you know what they have such little character that they shouldn't be called characters, the connected lines in the shape of bodies with mouths that move during dialogue are horrible abominations with very little development or personality. After 23232 episodes Ichigo could get decapitated and I wouldn't give a fuck, I barely knew the guy. He was a kind of a delinquent with a good heart? He cares about his friends? He was a 27 year old that's still in school for some reason and has no interests in life? that's about all I have on him, I don't even know why he cares about his friends they never seem like they have any fun with each other when their not in danger. They are all just kind of stoned face with nothing to talk about or convey. Characters that are upbeat or tough or whatever are just one note unless they are worried about something in battle. The story should be cool, the premise is sounds good but I just never end up caring because whats really at risk? oh no kurashitface town and the rest of their awful world might be consumed by hollows, who cares? They need to kill off 90 percent of the cast, maybe have a twist and reveal Ichigo was a mega chocolate hollow sent from the future to kill all humans, and have a slice of life subplot with Rukia and Rangiku that goes all yuri. The fights are cool I guess, when they have them, I thought Nel and the Espadas were boss. The whole show has a pretty cool atmosphere and the soundtrack is good, it's watchable just really boring. If you are still reading this go read hunter x hunter or watch the 2011 anime, support that shonen not this fucking garbage, like seriously have you seen hunter x hunter? What the hell right? So good its from the dude that made YuYu Hakusho, like even if you despise everything I've wrote go watch hunter x swagger it is orgasmic.

"I've decided to rewrite some of my reviews since my other's were more opinions then reviews. There may be spoilers involved so if you haven't finished the show yet, then you've been warned. I said their may be spoilers because I'm basically typing what I say, so don't troll me if my grammar is off. Anyway's, The Bleach series started out as any cliche Organization Vs Evil Things does ( Such as in D Grey Man, Soul Eater, Trinity Blood, Etc) and doesn't really start to get interesting until around episode 16 or 17. If you enjoy action over other genres and are willing to sacrifice having a Tolerable story to get it, then this is the show for you. This rather generic anime has some of the most intense fights in anime, which is perfect for those who watch anime for the fight scenes. I'll use the order of the rating system to review the show and others I might decide to review, So let's begin. First up for judgement is the Bleach story line. In my experience of the show the story was good up to the end. As I stated, the show didn't really start to get interesting until episode 17 were they travel to soul society. From their the story progressively gets better, Fights get more epic and powers become ridiculous. At the end of the soul society arc your left with some questions, as to be expected, and instead of giving answers they give fillers. The Bleach series was riddled with them, popping up when you just want to find out what happens next. I got sick of fillers and searched for a filler list so I could skip them. Without them the show was a little more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the ending of the main story was rather dreadful and quite frankly left the feeling of chewing on razor blades and using lemon juice as mouth wash afterwards. Sorry if that last phrase was more opinion then review material, but I was quite furious with everything that happened after Ichigo fights Ulquiorra. Next is art, Which was the best part of the show. The show was full of color and had an interesting array of special effects thrown in. The shows art style changes as it progresses, representing the advancements the studio is making towards more fluent animations. The fight scenes are Bleach's specialty and they certainly deliver. The way it seemed to work is that the show uses a lower budget anime style for the small engagements leading up to Kurosaki and his next boss fight ( Byakuya, Grimjow, Ulquiorra and Aizen). When those fights begin the animations become so flawless the you can't look away and so epic that you forget the color pink, the ability to transform into a cat elf thing and being emo aren't badass. As for Aizen turning into a butterfly? No wonder he wanted the world to end. His fight had spectacular animations even if lacking in movements. The field they were fighting on seemed to be more active then they were. Not much to say about the sounds, other the the fact that I loved the noise Cero makes when it's charging and then fired. The soundtrack was amazing as well, with my favorite song being Mysterious. The voice actors in the Japanese version were spectacular. I didn't watch the English version other then a couple episodes here and their for a comparison... Never watching dubbed anime again thanks to that ordeal. Now for character's. Ichigo is a decent enough protagonist. Aizen started out as an amazing antagonist. Other then that, there's way to many characters to review. Would have been nice if the story would kill some good guys off for once, you know, so the show doesn't feel so over populated. As for Aizens decline from amazing badass, well let me explain. When you first see Aizen he appears to be the only captain who gives a crap about the world, only to find that he's the one who triggered the events leading to Ichigo entering Soul Society. He appears to be a genius who is more then just an exceptional spell caster, but is extremely over powered and is prepared for every scenario. After he gets what he wanted and Beats a few captains to express his dominance he takes his glasses off and folds his hair back Clark Kent to Superman style and disappears into the world of the hollows. Unfortunately Kubo's writing ruined Aizen by taking his Foresight overboard. Having him state that all of ichigo's life has just been another one of his experiments. That he was aware of the boy from birth and had pushed Ichigo into all these situations to watch him progress to a stronger state. Then he turns into a butterfly and gets slaughtered by Ichigo in the completely one sided final battle. The show had a great deal of potential, but was lacking in almost every aspect. The concept of the Zanpakuto was very interesting and made for some nasty fight scenes. But I suppose it just wasn't my cup of tea, though I would rather watch every non fighting episode of this show then any episodes of DragonballZ. Keep in mind the I excluded everything after 310 cause as for as I'm concerned that's where the story should have ended. I give Bleach a 5 out of 10.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 10, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7a4c03687,6,5020

Bleach is very well made and is quite popular. I find Bleach to be very entertaining but sadly I believe it is very overrated. The story is quite original to the core. Though it really is the same as all the other &quot;The good guys got to win&quot; scenario. The sound is quite amazing how to goes along so well with the series itself. The music &quot;intensives&quot; the fights and makes the series captivating. It really gives the series a push in the right direction. The artwork is very very well done. All of the characters and monsters are incredible. I love the mix of characterr design and the lighting and shading are remarkible. The characters are a mix of original and nonoriginal personalities. The original characters are great but I find it hard to enjoy a character personality thats been used mutliple times. This series is most enjoyable and a great introductory to non-anime fans.

"I started to watch Bleach some years ago, and it was the ""1st"" anime I seen (not counting with Pokémon, Dragon Ball, Yu-Gi-Oh and others who I watched as a kid in television). In my opinion, Bleach got a good story, where we can see a lot of characters with different opinions, own mentality and personality, based on friendship and trust on each other, and a plot based on a battle of ""good against the evil"". As the story progresses, we notice that the course changes and the own opinion of the viewer can change too and shapes itself according to the appreciation of the anime itself. The 1st episode was an awesome entrance to the anime, where it shows the good and the bad guys of the story, the main characters, the abilities of each other, and the type of anime it will become forward. As the story progresses, it start to enter an enormous variety of characters, which is difficult at the start the record all of them, but as it goes on, we can relate the characters with their occupations and positions. Of course the anime cannot relate the full biography of all of that secondary personages, or it will be impossible to continue the story, but we got the essential of each one of them. With that, each viewer can get more related with one char than others, where we discover some badasses and others who are more reserved and closed. The music and soundtracks are well played, as the state of mind of the characters, the battles, or just when some new power is discovered. The battles are in fact one major theme in Bleach. We can see a lot of moves and understand the strength and the speed of each one of them. The graphics are very good, and there are many meanings behind each confrontation. As the episodes goes on, so the duration and force goes up as well. There also some negative parts in Bleach. One big fail (in my opinion of course) is the fact that there is too much fillers that run parallel to the main story, and that is a mainline problem that leads to that people hate this anime (in 366 eps, about 150 are fillers? It's an enormous waste!). Or u can also explain that in factors like "" financial issues "", or even ""it's made for the fans"". I really think that these excessive fillers spoiled a lot! The ambiance will vary enough, which have very heavy climates, and can quickly jump to a joyful moment, comic, or even stupid moment. It appears a lot. Another point I can add is the love/hate relationship I have with the main character. Ok, Kurosaki Ichigo goes to an almost normal student with orange hair who can see ghosts, to a baddass human who got shinigami, hollow, fullbringer and quincy powers, reached the maximum power output of any living been, like a God or something like that, and just for saving the ones who he loves (in other words, everyone he knows or has just met 2 seconds ago). One last thing: the story develops around a gigantic battle against two or more super powers (Shinigamis, Hollows, and you can also add the Vaizards), who finishes in a almost extermination of the enemy. The ""good"" side finishes with 0 deaths (everyone ""almost"" died, one old man lost an arm, and a dude lose [temporarily] is powers). Seems legit. At the end, I say that after all, I loved the anime. The fact that it was my 1st can influence my taste, but I still recommend it. If you can watch it without the fillers it will make it better, but you are a fan or you based on a rule that you only watch from the beginning to the end, go for it.",8,Recommended,"Jan 23, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_cca11e8c9f,6,3476
"The story of a a young man becoming a soul reaper, or an arch angel in a sense, who becomes one of the protectors of a town filled with violent ghosts and vampires is every kid's dream. Truly intoxicating. The action sequences that are involved with this show call for a great amount of talent as well as hard work to contain the large scale effects that this series uses - a feat not easily reached. But Bleach pulls it off. The sheer destruction and ominous tones this series employs requires some serious attention to detail, but it is reached at a enjoyable standpoint, and is even breathtaking at points. Ichigo, a young man who stands up for what he believes in and fights the good fight to his last breath, is an inspiration to all young men.

"Hmmm... bleach... what can i say?... It is a anime about shinigamis?... well, the storyline of bleach isn't very exciting, a 15 boy named kurosaki ichigo, suddenly one day, meets a shinigami, who gives him her powers, he then has to take on the role of a sub-shinigami, and fight ''hollows'' (another word for ''bad guys''... hold on a miniute. nothings really special... these type of storylines are kinda boring... Bleach gives a suprise now and then to viewers, which is what i call ''change of opinion... i sometimes rate the story 9/10, and other times its 2/10... often due to the stroy, i just switch to naruto... but most of the times, bleach has a pretty well standard storyline now the art... i'd say that the drawing in this anime Isn't bad. like the story, it changes between 10/10... to 5/10 they totally ruin the characters sometimes due to the way they look... oh, about the sound, i dont notice alot of difference, (i'm not very good with sound indicatence :) anyway i just love it when ichigo says ''BanKai!!!'' :) hehe... well thats me... :) I'd say this is what makes this anime's characters 10/10 in my opinion :) its ''I WANT TO FIND OUT'' part :) Enjoyment eah?, i gotta say its 8/10 not very enjoyble at some moments, but other moments makes me think I LOVE BLEACH!!! hehe Overall, this anime is recommanded by me for anyone to watch :) very fun and cool, its ok aslong as u skip some parts that u dont enjoy :) hehe Thanks for reading.

"this review is SPOILER FREE Story - 2 The narrative of Bleach is, in summary, a failure. The pacing of this show is god awful; and I even skipped the filler. The arcs were very generic and predictable, nothing noteworthy really. Now what is noteworthy, is how terrible the powerscaling in the show is. No show that I have seen has worse powerscaling than Bleach does. Without spoiling, mc beats a character in one arc, then he gets a big shounen power up, loses to someone in the next arc, and then the person that he beat in the previous arc shitstomps the person he lost to (without a big shounen power-up, mind you), this is not a one-time occurrence, it's frequent and happened not with just that one character but with multiple. People that lost to other people besides Ichigo also had similar things happen with them. Art/animation - 3 I know the show is older, and maybe I've been spoiled on more modern animation but it really is below average. Especially for a battle shounen. Older shounens, like the other 2 in the big three and dragon ball perhaps managed to deliver more appealing fight scenes than Bleach, i cannot say that I enjoyed watching a single one of them. As for the art itself, some of it was cool; but a lot of the character designs like for captains and arrancar were just copy and paste. Some characters had good designs and others had terrible designs. I would go further into that but that's spoiler territory right there Sound - 7 the openings are all pretty good, and there were a few bangers, same can be said about the OST. The OST had a few standout songs like Treachery, but it still wasn't anything crazy. The sound effects themselves were about average or maybe a little above, they weren't standout. Characters - 6 i found myself really enjoying a lot of the characters, but that's the key word; enjoying. I do not think a majority of the characters were well written, especially the main cast. All of the particularly charismatic characters were side characters or Chad (but he didn't do much and he wasn't particularly well written either). Back to why I claim that the characters were not well written; development was not handled with care and a lot of it felt rushed, and characters acted in ways that seemed really weird or forced. A score of 6 is simultaneously very generous for Bleach's characters but also a little bit of a letdown because some characters were genuinely cool and charismatic fellas that would've shined in a series with a better narrative. enjoyment - 2 I never understood what people meant by ""that show put me to sleep"" as I've never almost fallen asleep to a movie or show unless I was severely sleep deprived. However, watching this show i know what those people meant. That said, there were points where I found myself enjoying the show, and some of the characters, especially Urahara and Gin. But all of that aside, during my viewing of Bleach, I have never wanted to drop a show more, it was an absolute slog to get through; the only thing that kept me going was my desire to see the Thousand Year Blood War arc which looks amazing based on the production value. I also wouldn't particularly mind one episode of high-budget Bleach a week.",3,Not Recommended,"Aug 25, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_007f4e1288,6,3210

"I wrote this review when I was like 14. Please ignore everything. Im sure you will after reading ""Bleach remains one of my favorite mangas...."" anyways. Just dont bother with this series watch something good -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Bleach remains one of my favorite mangas of all time, and I was excited to see it as an anime, but after finishing it, I wish I had just stuck with the manga. Lets start with story; Which the anime did a decent job of conveying from the manga, that is, when the anime CARED about the actual story. There is so much filler in the anime. There are entire filler arcs that completely de-rail the pacing of the rest of the show, adding filler characters that have their own filler back stories. FILLER INSIDE OF FILLER.The plot also moves at a snails pace in the anime, one issue of the manga boils to about 4 episodes at best. Some times it just feels like a chore to watch, but it has its moments.Overall, the story is very good with many, many, unexpected twists that you won't see coming, and a very satisfying ending, (I'm actively trying to forget anything happens after the fullbringer arc) Art and Sound; The animation is nothing special, very stereotypical stuff. Does nothing to shake up the formula, but doesn't really need to. As for the soundtrack, its very, VERY hit and miss. The beginning of the show hosts some great openings, decent at best endings, and at the time, a GREAT in show soundtrack. Notice how I said 'at the time'? Well it's true, in the beginning, every song seems so cool, but with 366 episodes and only 1 or 2 songs added in, the background music quickly gets repetitive and tedious,except for the series's ""signature song"" 'Number One', and it's many re-mixes Characters; Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Here we have Bleaches biggest downfall, the cast. While they're a certainly great, funny, relate-able, and bad-ass characters in bleach, their screen time is very lacking. The main cast that has most of the screen time are either 2cool4u edgemasters (like Ichigo, Renji, Byakuya, Rukia, the list goes on...) or just annoying as fuck charecters (KUROSAKI-KUN, KUROSAKI-KUN, KUROSAKI-KUN....) It's not a completely hateable cast, its a 50/50 draw of whether you will like a certain character or not. For the most part, you can put up with them, but it is by no means a solid cast. Overall Enjoyment and Recommendation; Bleach the Anime is very, very long. And in my opinion, the amount of enjoyment you get out of it vs the amount of time you put into it is not equal. It's so painfully average in everything it does while just being able to barely keep you enticed for the whole ride. My recommendation is that if you really want to experience bleach, just Sod the anime and read the manga. If you are hellbent on watching the anime, I would quit after the soul society arc, because it goes far downhill from there.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6a09689c44,6,2942
"Where do I even start with my dear Bleach? Characters are one of the best if entire anime/manga world. Almost every of the major protagonist/villain character is different with unique traits and personality. Most of the cast is very likeable since their first apperance on screen. They are not only good or bad in 0/1 terms (they're not villains only because they are evil and that is the only reason), everyone has their own motivations and goals. Tite Kubo created a multilayered characters, which are main source of Bleach success. Every single antagonist in this series is very likeable. The designs of the villains instantly makes them looking badass and cool. OST is amazing with epic, thrilling themes. Those soundtracks are iconic and they're being well fitted into the show. Shiro Sagisu is an incredible talented person, hats off. The plot is interesting with a lot of plot twists and later revealings throughout the story progress. Artstyle is changing as fast as it was in the manga. The improvements between first episode and those only 20 after are big and it does not stop to evolve through the whole series. Voice acting is amazing. The voices of the cast are iconic and they match the personalities of the played role. One thing to say about the fillers being said as one of the biggest downside of the Bleach. You just don't need to watch them. We live in the modern times and there is simply no reason to don't check which episodes are skipable beacause they were just made to fill gaps between manga arcs in those times (so obviously they don't containt any signifant plot and are less quality ones from the first look). I can understand that an older Bleach TV viewer might got confussed that the story is boring because this arc is completely irrelevant to the rest of the story. They have no choice to avoid the non-manga episodes but now everyone has this opportiunity. The show itself obviously contains this big amount of more boring episodes but we have the knowledge to avoid them and enjoy the proper animation of the original work. Just don't watch the original studio products made to maintain the screentime in TV.",10,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5898725c46,6,2146
"Had to write this review for my favourite Series. First of All bleach is that dish that you will either like it and became a fanboy for your whole life or you will hate it with core. While it may not be the case for everyone. First of All what is bleach? By reading the synopsis you be like: A samurai anime wow Another sword style anime oh While Bleach is said to be in big 3 it has lot less popularity compared to other big 3 members(naruto and one piece) but its just my opinion but i think bleach is better than both. Bleach is not a roller coaster of emotion like naruto or one piece or a extremely well written and crafted story like AOT. BELIEVE ME MAN its not either animation carrying show like demon slayer. So what the hell is bleach, why do i and so many people like this so much. Bleach is a fun ride of Great characters and well crafted plot . Pretty memeable and entertaining. Bleach is not just a shonen where it mc wants to achieve greater heights and excite or inspire the viewers. bleach main character ichigo don't want to be hokage pirate king etc. Or soul king in sense of this series. Ichigo's only goal is to protect his friends and family. He was chosen to be a special boy before his birth it was not his fate. He didn't have aspirations to become a soul reaper, my god he doesn't know what that mean before he became one. Ichigo kept fighting for his friends and family which makes him a likable character because he doesn't have his own sense of justice. Ichigo is not like other mcs who cry out loud their name, ambition, father name, mother name, aadhar card number everywhere. Bleach has so many unique and cool characters but you know why ichigo is still the most popular one. Because he is lovable he cares for people. He is the type of friend you wnat in real life or the type of person you wanna be. Enough about mc, let's talk about villian, this is a non spoiler review so i ain't gonna spoil the villan name to you but i must say this anime villian is the best villian of all time. Even though he is a great villian you will love him but you won't support his actions unless you are a edgy kid. That's what make him feel like a true villian. If we talk about technical things then This Anime adaptation isn't too great at start but picks up later on. If you are planning to watch this series then be sure to skip fillers one which adds no value to the story. If we talk about animation, then i think animation is weird at first but gets pretty awesome later on. The legendary art style +good animation adds the scene. The anime adaptation isn't perfect but worth a watch, you should read the manga too. I know you may think if the story is not good(as maybe others told you) and the animation is inconsistent why would i watch this? Well believe me story is great you have to feel it and understand it. Plus character designs are too good i'm sure you will love it and appreciate the authors drawings. Plus bleach has comedy sequences and its comedy is better than other big 3. So you should definitely watch this. Sayonara :)",9,Recommended,"Jan 27, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_075c07b056,6,3064
"This was the first anime that I ever watched so speaking without bias gets a bit tough here. I really enjoyed bleach, the OSTs , sound, concept were really good especially in the first 2-3 arcs. I liked ichigo as the MC and rukia was good as the FMC, I did find a few of the captains of the soul society annoying tbh. Now speaking about the bad parts-it could have been better at some parts, people think the character development could have been better, which is understandable, although I might disagree with that. If anything I feel the final arcs could have been done better and there was this one time where they showed a cool fight and then immediately showed an alt. arc which bewildered me tbh. It was sad that kubo's relationship with the higher-ups kinda spoiled it at the end, and somewhat similar case with the manga, where his health worsened, Do i reecd this series? surely, but be ready to face the consequences of what I told above",9,Recommended,"Jul 23, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9ee6ce8598,6,947
"Bleach is one of the most popular anime of all, is this why you should watch it? not really, bleach has too many good points and too many bad points despite that it is a story worth watching Story: The story of bleach is simple shinigamis vs hollows, but the more the story progresses, the more will be discovered, new races, new powers, and better construction, in fact bleach has one of the best sagas of the neketsu, also it has some arcs a little slow already Sometimes it seems that the story will not advance but with its lots of plot twists it makes it enjoyable, it may remind you a little of Yu Yu Hakusho with the theme of spirits, but Bleach has a unique style that no other anime has. One of the biggest problems with bleach is that the story often focuses too much on its protagonist, but many times secondary and villains are also given importance so it is not so bad. Another big problem that is not the fault of bleach, but of the pierrot company, is its massive filler, there are filler arcs of 40 episodes in a row and it was one of the great bleach problems, its first filler arc is lousy and boring but it was put just after the end of a great saga so the weather was not so bad, which did not do his next two arcs, which put in the middle of sagas or important moments damaging the whole experience, his final arc is very good and was put in a good moment but the error of the other arches is incredible so much that it helped its cancellation, so although these arches have moments that are worth it and the last arc is great with great animation they were a great damage for the fans by bleach. As several nekketsu follow a known formula, so comedy and ecchi are expected, in terms of comedy bleach stands out, it has very funny moments around the whole series thanks to good characters who contribute it, but although it has comedy they do not put it in serious moments or important moments for the plot so it is very enjoyable, in terms of ecchi it is debatable for each person, personally I do not like ecchi since it seems unnecessary in an anime and bleach despite having ecchi are very few scenes, and for the large number of episodes it is not felt to bother. The mystery is present in bleach and is very well handled especially in its second and last arc, it keeps you aware of what is happening and then everything changes with a great plot twist, this is very exciting when you see it for the first time and not know nothing that happens If we talk about problems in bleach, it may be that it has several deux machina that damage the anime a lot, that sometimes things are resolved because yes, because a new power came out, like in lots of nekketsu, there are two great ones that I will not speak for spoilers but yes they are a big mistake And to end the story, there is  that bleach was canceled, because of this it is not the same ending that exists in the manga, despite this I think it is a nostalgic ending for all the people who see it, they leave the Possibility of a new sequel, and although it is more like a season finale than a series finale, it can be considered a good and endearing ending. Art: This is one of the strongest points of bleach, the character design is incredible and unique, no bleach character looks alike and there are a lot of characters, tite kubo's style is unique and has given bleach great recognition. The animation studio, although it could not match the incredible art of tite kubo, did a great job considering the studio that it is, there are great battles with very good choreographies and throughout the series the animation was improving showing its highest level right in the last Stand. Scenarios such as the society of souls and las noches are very recognized, even the design is incredible and nothing like it has been seen. Sound: This is undoubtedly one of the best bleach points the voice actors of bleach are quite good, they do an excellent job, they really convey the feelings of the scenes, the screams the powers are acted in an incredible way The bleach ost are simply a masterpiece, the bleach music is incredible ost like senna is extremely epic, and they are always put at the right moments, not to mention their openings that all are not incredible, highlighting the 13, the 12 and the 2, and endings as the last one with which the series was dismissed. character Bleach has an incredible number of characters, not only human, spirits and other races, it is a very large universe, and although the variety is good, it is a great bleach problem, due to the immense number of characters, there are very few characters that they have a good development or contribute to the plot, it is undoubtedly the biggest problem with bleach, even so it has endearing and very good characters, starting with the main villain who is also considered one of the best in anime without a doubt bleach has quite a few memorable characters Enjoyment I think that people who see bleach are going to enjoy it a lot, in addition to that if they do not like the filling there are several pages to skip it, even so it is very enjoyable, of course if you like nekketsu genre animes you will enjoy much more, fights, action and blood, I would see it again but for scenes since the anime is quite long, I would still enjoy it again to relive fights and memorable scenes, so bleach despite the years has too many fans who love the series In conclusion, I highly recommend bleach, it is an anime that despite its declines has very high points, it is worth seeing it at least once you will enjoy this great story a lot, which I raise a point for the love I have for it, even with what bad bleach is amazing",9,Recommended,"Jul 3, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b384091f41,6,5667
"SKIP FILLERS! Enjoy main story. SKIP all the fillers, no exceptions. Bleach is an excellent anime with immense potential, but unfortunately, that potential is squandered by the filler episodes. Bleach is almost on par with the original Naruto. But the animation studio, driven by greed and a lack of creativity, decided to exploit Bleach. The result? A whopping 50% of the series is filled with unnecessary low IQ filler episodes. These fillers not only make the characters seem less intelligent and useless, but also made storyline unatractive. The filler stories are nothing short of garbage. Fillers backstab the essence of Bleach, turning the entire anime experience into something questionable and senseless.

"Bleach as an anime is mediocre at best. The concept is great but the execution is extremely lacking. The early episodes have fairly poor animation, and I didn't feel that the anime was even remotely good until around episode 270, but at that point it was still only a /decent/ anime. There's a huge power-scaling problem with the characters, and the fillers are horrible. Bleach has a higher filler:canon ratio than Naruto does (at the time of writing this review). While one may dislike Naruto fillers (I personally like them due to the following reason), at least Naruto fillers almost always add to character development and the story. You can even look at them as canon if you so wish. Bleach filler is fairly low quality with plot holes. Bleach fillers also add zero character development, and to top it off, most of Bleach's full filler arcs do not actually have a place in the Bleach universe (they physically cannot have happened in the past or happen in the future). The arcs also come around at the most inopportune times (i.e. a full 30 episode filler arc unrelated to the story between two consecutive fights in a canon arc). The anime's story is very linear. I felt as though it was being written day-to-day rather than planned out. ""Okay, this person's going to win this fight; let's make it happen."" I honestly didn't get the feeling that any sort of deep thought had gone into the anime until after 310 wherein it's mostly filler from then until 366. Many anime can provide certain levels of ""hype"" during a big fight. Whenever Bleach presents such a moment, it's extremely short lived. The ""final"" fight gave me the most ""hype,"" which only lasted MAYBE two minutes. I don't find any of the soundtracks to be worth returning to. I occasionally listen to some of the openings and endings, but the overall soundtrack is relatively unimpressive. I enjoy Bleach's character design and wide range of characters, and it was ""entertaining,"" to say the literal most. I gained very little from this anime besides adding 366 episodes to MyAnimeList.

"Bleach is the ultimate delusion. You may take a look at the average rating for this show and think ""Hey, this show must not be that bad. I'll give it a watch."" I am posting this review to warn you ahead of time: those reviews are not for Bleach in its entirety. Let me explain. I, like many others, got hooked by Bleach in its first season. In fact, I should state now that if you're only interested in watching the first three seasons you'll probably come away feeling pretty happy. Up to that point, the show is stellar. It's fast-paced, full of interesting characters and has a great story set in a fascinating setting. If this were a review for the first three seasons, I would be offering glowing praise. Unfortunately, Bleach is a lot longer than three seasons. A lot longer. And that's where the torture begins. It's like buying a new tv that's amazing for a while and then explodes in your living room or making a good friend who takes you out to lunch and jokes with you about everything before leaving you tied up behind a dumpster while they clean out your apartment. After the first three seasons, the writing nosedives very hard. And it isn't just bad, it's distinctly bad. It's clear that whoever is writing this trash has no idea where it's headed and is hoping and praying that no one will notice by flooding the script with as many characters as possible. Oh but it doesn't stop there. In writing, there is an idea referred to as ""setup and payoff"". This is the notion that something in a story can be set up for the reader to be resolved at a later time. For example, in Star Wars: A New Hope it could be Luke learning the ways of the force and by the end of Return of the Jedi, mastering the force. A good setup leaves the audience intrigued yet mystified, wondering how something will resolve. And a good payoff is that moment where the setup is satisfied and all the loose ends are tied up. Bleach is the textbook example of what NOT to do with setups and payoffs. The thoughtlessness that went into writing Bleach is kind of amazing: it has a very rare distinction of dumping so many setups on the audience that I actually lost track. I had to be reminded by others watching the show of numerous other plotholes I hadn't even considered. Oh and before you ask ""Did they payoff all those setups?"" I will remind you that this review is scored very low for a reason. Every rule is broken. Every character is ultimately meaningless. Every relationship develops no one. By the end of the series, it becomes painfully obvious how much time has been wasted, not just by the audience, but by the architects of this train wreck. The only possible satisfaction I can imagine that anyone would derive would be due to the character designs. Maybe it could be a springboard for fanfiction. I can't imagine any fanfiction would be worse than this. I'm giving the story a 2 because I can't overlook the first three seasons (which were very well done). The animation was highly inconsistent and it was extremely obvious when the studio was spending more or less money on their episodes. The soundtrack was compelling (again, for the first three seasons) and then just became reused and rehashed everywhere they could think of. By the end it was just annoying. For those who don't know, the manga continued on after the show finished. You might ask: why did the show stop then? As the show progressed, it became obvious how painful it must've been for the studio to keep making this swill every week. The animation suffered hard, the voice actors stopped trying and it was generally clear that no one really cared about Bleach anymore (both those making it AND viewing it). They decided to finally stop pumping it full of whatever it took to keep it alive and let it die. It should've died about 250 episodes before that but better late than never. It's very sad because Bleach had tremendous potential. To take something so good and run it so hard into the ground is painful. It didn't have to turn into such garbage. Overall, Bleach was a phenomenal waste of my time and I wrote this review as a warning to others. If this review was too long to read or you just want the gist, it's this: the first 3 seasons are great and worth watching and everything else after is just filler. NOTE: This is not a review of the manga. I haven't wanted to risk finding out if the source text is as bad as what spawned from it. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I have decided to add an addendum for all the things wrong with Bleach that I could think of, just to emphasize the point of how badly this show lost its way. 1) The relationship between Rukia and Ichigo. In the beginning of the story, it's complex and interesting. You can't really tell if they're just really good friends or if there's a bit more between them. Whatever it is, it's endearing and special. However, after Soul Society, their relationship is completely ignored and they barely have any useful interactions. By the end of the ACTUAL last season (not the filler-like ""manga canon"" last season with Xcution), the fact that Ichigo would not see Rukia again doesn't matter at all. 2) Bleach introduces three totally useless characters during the protagonist's trip to Hueco Mundo: Nel, Porsche and Dummychaka. They clearly exist for no other reason than to add humor yet they consume an immense amount of screen time. By the end, their purpose is still unclear as they seemingly vanish and no one ever brings them up again. 3) Perhaps the most egregious of Bleach's failures is that of Aizen. Let's go over ALL the problems with Aizen: 3a) Here's a guy who seemingly tricked everyone into believing he's a good guy because of the power of his zanpakuto. Then it turns out a bunch of captains from a hundred years prior figured out how bad he was (including Urahara). But for some reason none of them thought it would be useful information to share with anyone because present-day Soul Society still has no clue that he's bad news. Oh yeah and Urahara seems to think that information is useless to share with Ichigo when he's training him for Soul Society, the place WHERE AIZEN IS. 3b) The one blind guy who can't have been affected by Aizen's hypnosis follows him willingly. Wow, cool, interesting. Why does he do that? Is he really tricking Aizen and waiting for a chance to strike when his guard is down? Nope! He's just blind. And he randomly becomes an angry monster at the end and dies. Probably the grossest misuse of setup and payoff in this entire disaster of a show. 3c) Ichigo, it turns out, is the ONLY person that hasn't seen Aizen's released zanpakuto and thus isn't affected by his hypnosis. Therefore, he's the only one that can save the day. The fourth captain warns him ahead of time: don't look at his zanpakuto! So what does Ichigo do? Look at it. A lot. Does it make any difference? Nope. Does Aizen's fall have anything at all to do with Ichigo seeing through his hypnosis? Nope. It's totally irrelevant. 3d) Aizen has this extremely powerful hypnosis ability. It makes everyone see what he wants them to see. But he decides to show his hand to everyone instead of maintaining that illusion. Why? Who knows. Maybe it's because he doesn't need that ability at all because his spiritual power is through the roof. 3e) Aizen has no backstory. What's that you say? The main antagonist for the ENTIRE SHOW has no backstory? Yes, that's right. There's none. Not one time do we ever get any motivation for Aizen's actions. He's just a bad dude who's smart enough to trick everyone but not smart enough to keep tricking everyone. Considering that pretty much every single meaningless character who shows up gets a backstory, this is a pretty major oversight. 3f) Why was it important for Ichigo to progress? Aizen said he'd been spying on Ichigo for pretty much his whole life. He said that he carefully planned it out so that Ichigo would progress the way he did. Okay cool - so why? We never find out why. No really. Bleach never tells us why. Maybe he's just a voyeur. 4) Orihime's kidnapping in Hueco Mundo was pointless. They said they were interested in her powers then said forget it. 5) Orihime's powers were regarded as extraordinary by the bad guys. Then they said forget it. 6) Orihime is shown the Hogyoku. Why? Who knows. Then she says ""Cool, I'm gonna help the good guys with this knowledge."" Then doesn't and says forget it. 7) Orihime loves Ichigo. She thinks he's the bees knees. They have touching moments together, one where she says goodbye to him while he sleeps and others where he's making himself stronger for her. But by the end none of this matters at all because Orihime and Ichigo just go on with their lives. 8) In the last season Chad becomes a completely different character. He starts yelling a lot and throwing fits. 9) Ichigo beats these powerful captains in Soul Society (Kenpachi and Byakuya) but then can't fight anything without needing his internal hollow yet those same captains seem to have no problem destroying Espada (which are supposedly much more powerful than captains). 10) The Visored are pointless. They need Ichigo (why?) and then when he leaves from them they don't care. What have they been doing in exile for the last hundred years? Sitting in that warehouse? Clearly not telling anyone about Aizen despite knowing what happened. Did the Visored have any effect on the final battles? Nope. 11) For that matter, Xcution is just the Visored again. They even have a stereotypical angry loud girl. Tsukishima is Aizen. Same quiet and outwardly nice manner. Same manipulation of people's interpretation of events. I guess they're all different because they're drawn different. 12) Also Xcution had no effect on Ichigo getting his powers back. If Ichigo had sat around and picked his nose for a week, Soul Society would've given him his powers back anyway. Xcution had no relevance to anything at all. 13) If you thought Dragonball Z fights were drawn out, you haven't seen anything yet. Bleach masters this in a way that DBZ can't even come close to. I have watched much anime but have never been quite as miserable and bored and desperate for it to end as during the Hueco Mundo incursion. 14) Ichigo's dad and Ishida's dad know each other. How? Why? Who knows. 15) During the Hueco Mundo fight with Ulquiorra above the sky, Ishida states in a narrative that looking back, he should've never taken Orihime up there and regretted it. Why? 16) During the first three seasons (around the time they finally leave Soul Society), no one can fly. Bleach realizes that it's not DBZ and that it doesn't have to have flying characters. After the first three seasons they completely forget this rule, everyone can fly and it's never explained. 17) It is established early on in the show that those who live in Soul Society don't age. Then whoever writes this crap decided that was too hard to keep consistent and allowed aging (like Gin who apparently was a child and then grew up). 18) Speaking of ripping off DBZ, Bleach also busted out the time chamber. They needed some excuse for Ichigo to train for a long period of time so he could triumph over Aizen. Unfortunately, it made absolutely no sense. See, they trained in this place between worlds and could do so because this thing (a ""sweeper"") had been destroyed so they could. Except for the problem that it had already been established that the sweeper came only once a week so why couldn't anyone go in there and train for 6 days? Given the show's explanation that 1 hour in the real world is equivalent to 2,000 hours in that place, 6 days would've been an immense amount of training for anyone. Oh and why does Isshin know about this? Well, we don't know why, because... 19) Isshin has NO BACKSTORY. The father of the main protagonist turns out to be an ex-shinigami. Urahara sees this and mentions something like ""oh, you got your powers back."" Back? What happened? Why does Isshin wear a tattered captain's cape? Was he a captain? I don't know. No one does. Because Bleach is actually a prank played on those who were stupid enough to follow along. As someone who watched every episode, I can admit I was duped. That's all I can think of now. tl;dr - this show sucks a lot.",2,Not Recommended,"Jul 21, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bb91aec619,6,12239
"This is one anime I started and finished a long time ago. I spent a lot of time keeping up with the upcoming episodes since the series was ongoing for such a long time. I don't remember every detail of it, but I do remember enjoying it a lot, and it is one of those series where yo could watch 30 episodes in one day and still want more. you see the main character and his friends grow stronger, and mature together as the story goes, and there is always a cliff hanger after every episode that keeps you hungry for the next one. Overall this series is among my favorites, the story is divided in arcs or seasons if you want to call it that, and they're all a different story yet its all connected making it a huge 366 episode story. the music was among my favorite things in this series, it was catchy and engaging and felt very good, the art its its own, very well done. The characters all develop differently and some more than others. there are so many important characters in the series that makes it even more impressive at how they all are developed, I read a review saying they didn't do a good job on the characters but I would have to disagree. The amount of characters this series have. They're are all important and every single one haves a background and a reason to do what they do. on characters I would have to say they did a very good job. and now I will explain why this series is an 8 for me and not the perfect 10. and my 1 and only reason would be filler episodes. Filler episodes took so much from the main story. my recommendation to someone who has not yet started the series, and is looking for a series full of action, is to skip the filler episodes as they come up. some fillers take several episodes and some of those are actually not bad, but some of them can be completely stupid and really take away from the exciting moments of the main story. Pros: Long story to keep you entertained for a very long time, full of action that gets better as the story progresses, many characters with very individual personalities that can appeal to any watcher, amazing action music, and not to mention the opening and closing songs used are Extremely appealing, and some you will most likely love to download them. great art and animation of powers. an overall action packed series that will excite you every episode (non filler) Cons: series took a long time to finish but since it finally finished it is no longer a con. and the real con, Filler episodes that thew off the main story and character development. know that these fillers can be skipped, making this one of the best series out there! Recommend: YES, I recommend this series to anyone and everyone, as long as they like action and a good overall plot.",8,Recommended,"Feb 24, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8789e4cc34,6,2733
"To tell the truth I was really skeptical at first cause I find Bleach is considered one of ""the three mainstreem animes"" ( along with One piece and Naruto). And personally I tend to not like them, but considering I was wrong about Naruto (which is now a fav) I decided to give it a try. The story is very interesting cause it's basically genious, you don't get tired of it cause the longer the serie progresses the more deep the plot gets and it's filled with interesting twists. I easily get bored, but let me tell you so far Bleach has managed to keep my interest. If you like animes with wicked fighting, truly interesting characters mixed together with humour but also seriousness this is defenitly for you! My favorite aspects of the serie are the characters, the fighting and basically the story! I really have to give it a 10 but because it's defenitly one of the best series I've ever watched. I do have a bit of a problem when it comes to the fillers, but don't get me wrong there's not that much fillers in Bleach if one were to compare it to Naruto. And even the fillers are enjoyable. Have fun watching! NOTE: these are my own opinions based on what I feel and think, they may be the complete oposite of the readers.

"I don't get why people hate Bleach. Seriously, Bleach has got to be one of the best anime around! I hope this review can give you a better view of Bleach and give it another chance. For those who whine and complain that Bleach is full of fillers, you are not wrong. However, you can easily skip these if you know which episodes are fillers and which are the real story. The first arc, The Soul Society arc is arguably the most exciting. This arc is from episode 1-63. In this arc, Ichigo and his friends attempts to save Rukia, a shinigami who has once saved Ichigo's family from danger and shared her (Shinigami) powers with Ichigo. Here a lot of interesting characters are introduced from the Gotei 13 (The Thirteen Protection Squads). The Gotei 13 serves to protect the Soul Society. Each squad has a captain and vice-captain (lieutenant). Captains are highly superior and very much respected and admired by their subordinates for their strength and power. Ichigo and his pals are labelled ryoka (intruders) by the Soul Society. Regardless, they proceed fight after fight to save Rukia, battling powerful opponents, including some of the captains. After the first arc, we enter the Bount arc, an anime-exclusive arc which has no relevance to the manga by Tite Kubo. Skip the Bount arc, trust me,and everything would be perfect:) This arc is from episode 64-109. As far as I'm concerned, this arc is filler stuff, so I skipped it. Now, this Hueco Mundo arc or Arrancar arc, is where Bleach picks up its pace from where it left off at the Soul Society arc. One of the captains, Aizen betrayed Soul Society and retrieved the Hyogoku, a powerful item which he used to create an army of Arrancars (modified Hollows which have Shinigami powers). This arc focuses mostly on Aizen and his Arrancars at a place called Hueco Mundo. The Arrancars are divided into several levels, the strongest one being the Espada. An Espada's strength is said to be equal or stronger than a captain's. Ichigo and the others are overwhelmed by the Espada's powers, which are stronger than anything they've fought before. After suffering heavy defeat, everyone trains desperately to improve themselves and prepare for the upcoming battle against the Arrancar. In the midst of everyone's training, Orihime (one of Ichigo's friend) is captured by Ulquoirra (an Espada) under Aizen's command, after Aizen realised Orihime's unique powers which might benefit him and his plan to overthrow Soul Society. The Hueco Mundo/ Arrancar arc is from episode 110-167. Take note that they are several filler episodes here, from episode 128-135. These filler episodes are not connected to the original plot or storyline in any way, so it's best to be skipped. If you have stuck with reading my review until here, I sincerely thank you. At the time of this review, I have watched Bleach until episode 167. Take note that episode 168-189 is also filler stuff. In short, Bleach is just amazing. You can easily get so carried away by the story and fall in love with the characters. Bleach is a perfect blend of action and comedy with a hint of romance. The fight scenes are awesome and exciting to watch! Lastly, I would like to give my praise to Tite Kubo, the person who created Bleach and to Noriyuki Abe, TV Tokyo, Dentsu and Studio Pierrot for producing the anime Bleach.",10,Recommended,"Feb 18, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9131b84ee8,7,3331
"From sword clashing ding dangs, to sparks flying, to... atomic bombs. Oh how it tears me up to see little delinquent Ichigo grown up to be a true hero. Following the series since 2006, I've supported Bleach as one of my favorite animes all these years. However, it saddens me to see how the our generation of audience has grown up while the anime still remains ""youthful"" as ever. Don't get me wrong, I still love it to bits, but I laugh at the naivety of the overall development. Story: 6 More than 300 episodes already, still the same old fighting minons, then fighting the ultimate boss. I have lost count of how many times Ichigo was near death or should have died from fatal blows. From fighting fellow shinigamis to fighting ex-shinigamis to hollows to ex-hollows to fighting their swords to fighting themselves.... nice twists (so predictable) Art: 8 The art has evolved, thank god. It looks much more sleek and smooth from Saving Rukia Arc. I got to admit, the ""atomic bombs"" (aka. getsuga tensho) Ichigo produces in ep 339 really pumps adrenaline in my veins. Notice how the character appearance changed and improved since the beggining, especially Ichigo with his more handsome face. Rumor has it this is because of a shift in target of audience from pure shonen to attracting female audience as well. Sound: 7 I really liked almost all of the openings and endings, I can see the developers put a lot of thought into the first impression, which is the opening, of the anime. The music all suited the theme of Bleach very well: exciting, upbeat and a bit wild like Ichigo's hollow form ;) The OST always bring up nostalgic feelings from when I watched Bleach as a tween. However, it's unfortunate to say there's absolutely no change in OST for the past 6+ years. It's almost funny how the OST from Bount arc pops up when fighting arrancars. Character: 9 The character designs are pretty amazing: from the hair, to the eyes, to the costumes to the personaities; out of the countless supporting characters, it is almost impossible to find two characters that I will mix up. There are also many characters that I adore because of their personality and design, like Grimmjow, Byakuya and Hitsugaya. The only thing that I'm not satisfied about is the character development. I have mentioned earlier Ichigo's powers went beyond godly with atomic bombs with a single slash. And he is much more mature since the beggining. But what about others? Rukia? Same helpless kid, even with her awesome zanpaktou. Orihime? You would think after the experience with Ulquiorra that she'd be more useful and grown up. Instead she just sits there and sees her comrades getting slashed up without ANY thought of, "" hey, maybe it's time for my godly healing powers that can even bring back the dead.""-.- Enjoyment: 7 My eyes were glued to the screen before when I watched the epic battles like fights with the espadas. But now, I giggle at the most wrong spots. Why? Because it's so cliche and predictable. I'm sure the protagonists won't have a easy win EVER, and the enemy will strike back, almost killing them all. And I'm positive that no matter what the state of Ichigo's health is, he will get up and beat the crap out of the boss. But then again, it's always nice to see atomic bombs, earthquakes and flying people. Overall: 7 This score is the absolute lowest I can give to my once-upon-a-time favorite anime. (I have sentimentlal ties to the soul society and its shinigamis.) OF COURSE I STILL HAVE HOPES FOR IT! I'll keep thinking that the anime will make me mind blown once more.",7,Recommended,"Jan 26, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_94e543f47f,7,3576
"TOO MANY FILLERS!!! Story: 6/10 I don't know how some hard core anime fans watch an anime like Bleach. A story that starts out fantastically but takes WAY too many twists and turns. I loved the first couple episodes the most. Art: 7/10 I thought the art was decent and the fighting scenes were pretty badass. Sound: 7/10 The music was beautiful like Will of the Heart. Bleach had many good opening theme songs as well. Character: 7/10 I loved Ichigo's brave character, loved Rukia's strong female character, didn't like Orihime much.. Enjoyment: 5/10 The fillers became so much of a distraction that I gave. I loved the beginning of the anime.

"I'm going to go ahead and start this review out by saying one thing: I have no idea where the hype came from with this anime. This anime is nothing more than basic. I would rarely find any enjoyment out of this, and after so many seasons of saying ""If I gave up on it now, something enjoyable will happen sooner or later will happen,"" I ran out on my hope. First of all, the filler episodes are not needed. Rarely are you going to find enjoyment out of a 366 episode anime. If you'd rather not waste time watching the anime but still want to say you wanna, I guess, ""ride the Bleach train"" (weird way of putting it), I'd recommend the manga. It's much more enjoyable and there are barely any dull moments. After so many episodes, they would play the same sounds over and over again. If you're going to make 366 episodes, switch out the music every now and then. Also, I guess I didn't get far enough to really dig into any character development. I mean, I heard that Ichigo changed a lot (and don't get me wrong, he's definitely babe), but other than that, I don't know. As said before, the enjoyment was decent. Me giving a 5 overall was me being generous. There's nothing more to say about this anime. I wish I could say something else good besides saying there was some humor in it, but I can't. Hopefully someone out there found this anime entertaining. Still confused as to why it ranks #6.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 22, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd13b76aef,7,1395
"Bleach is a mixed bag, I'd love to give it a 8 for the first 63 Episodes which where really good, with a bit too long fights though. They could've easily made bleach a 36 EP Anime and I might have given it a 9 for being pretty amazing. But they didn't. If you want to watch bleach then enjoy the first arc, the first 63 EPs and stop it. I don't know how many of the 360 EPs are fillers, but my guess is 50% or more. In This Anime there are actually only 2 Arcs that matter and those two are the first 1-63 and the second stretched around the next 300 Episodes filled with endless flashbacks and side stories no one cares about. The second story arc isn't really bad to start with, the main problem is it's endless length and that is interrupted with many many fillers that don't really contribute to the story in any way and flashbacks that tell the story of gaining ability XY to finish that enemy off. Worst of all seems to be the pacing, if there aren't fillers or flashbacks, then there are fights that are fought not only one episode, but 3-10 episodes! How do they manage this? Easy! They give you a summary of what happened before in every episode, that summary is so long that about 10 minutes including the intro are not contributing to the story at all... If bleach where a 63 Episodes Anime, it would have been great. But it isn't, the first 63 EP deserve at least an 8/10 the rest a 2/10 - on average it should have been a 5 but honestly after watching 330(or so I don't really know) EPS to see the second(and final) arc ending, I can't rate it anything higher than 3.",3,Not Recommended,"May 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ab7d738c00,7,1580
"First of all I'd like to thank my friend who suggested I watch Bleach. Because although I have been really into anime lately, but Bleach might just make an otakou outta me. Also, I'm really new to this and I have no idea how to write a proper review, so bear with me 😅 Bleach is probably the longest anime I'll ever watch, but it will always be the closest to my heart. That's why I decided to leave a review for the first time. Characters: 10/10 Every character was so unique and I'm really amazed by Kubo's insane ability to create this number of distinct characters with different personalities and looks. Ichigo is the probably one of the best MCs, his personality is actually likable unlike most of MCs in other shows I'd watched before. Plot/Story: 8/10 The story was kinda repetitive at some point. Also, the filler arcs made a lot of people lose interest in the show, but I liked most of them. I liked that other supporting characters got to shine during those arcs. Animation/Art: 9/10 I liked the animation since the first episode, and what I liked more, is that it kept getting better until the end of the show. The last seasons were the best. Music/Sound: OBVIOUSLY 10/10 You can say anything about Bleach, but when it comes to its OSTs, I believe that everyone agrees that Bleach's OST is simply iconic. Especially during the Hueco Mundo arc, the Spanish music was superior. 👌🏻 Enjoyment: 10/10 For me, Bleach is a MASTERPIECE 💙",9,Recommended,"Jul 31, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_727051686c,7,1441

"Every time I hear the word Bleach—even laundry bleach to be honest—I always get struck by the nostalgia given to me by this anime. After all, I used to watch this anime a whole lot when it was shown in Philippines' channel GMA in the mornings. Before I continue, I want to make it clear that I'm reviewing this anime until around the Rurichiyo arc, so if you do not know who Rurichiyo is, please take care of possible spoilers! Being one of the shounen I have consumed since I was a kid, Bleach has some of the best storylines as far as I can remember. I recall trying to find bamboo sticks when I was younger, adorning them with a pink cloth from a ripped-out curtain, and shouting ""ZANPAKUTO"" and ""BANKAI"" when I'm playing by myself. That's how the storylines of Bleach influenced me. Perhaps the most memorable arc I have watched ""so far"" would be the Aizen arc, around episodes 150 to 170. Such spectacular execution that I would want to rewatch it sometime soon. The art, especially when the aspect ratio became 16:9, the improvement was certainly amazing as well, not to mention that many of the characters I liked based on their art—it evolved even more! The improvement per episode is nothing to scoff at, and judging by the fact that even more Bleach episodes will be released in the future, there is still many things to behold! As for the music, I would just want to praise one thing: the third opening entitled ""Ichirin no Hana."" I implore you to listen to it and hope that you'll get hooked just like how I did. The characters, especially the shinigami, were also memorable that even after years, I still remember their faces clearly. My two favorite characters would be Shuusuke Amagai—that one captain who gets drunk after one sip, and Rurichiyo Kasumiouji—that head of her clan. Overall, I am good memories of this anime that I still cherish to this day.

"2016 has to be one of the worst starts to the year; Terry Wogan, Lemmy, David Bowie and even Alan Rickman have bit the dust. But where are they now? If you have watched Tite Kubo's excellent anime Bleach, based on the manga of the same name, they will be somewhere in the Rukon district of Soul Society, all doing there thing, whilst many unknown things to them happen in the Seratai district. In the Seratai district, beings known as Shinagami (or Soul Reapers if you watch the English version of the show.) go down to earth and harvest dead souls to bring up to the Soul Society, and send evil souls to hell. This is to protect the 'balance of the universe', and what happens if a soul has been staying on Earth too long? They turn into demented creatures called Hollows, who must be killed to protect the universe. The very first episode sees one of these Soul Reapers (yes, I used the English term. Kill me now!) known as Rukia Kuchiki goes down to earth to defeat some hollows, but ends up destroying the house of Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see the usually invisible Soul Reapers. Rukia is wounded, and desperately gives all of her power to Ichigo. He saves Rukia but she committed a crime against the Soul Society, and is taken back by her brother Byakuya to be executed, setting up the first major arc. In terms of characters, Bleach has a whole host of great characters. My personal favourite is Kon; take Seth McFarlane's Ted and put in the mind and soul of Master Roshi and you pretty much have Kon...a perverted bear obssessed with boobies. Speaking of boobies, another cool character is Rangiku Matsumoto, a women obssessed with her looks. But seriously, there are so many great characters, so go and make your mind up yourself! What makes this anime so special for me though, is the Zanpaktou. A sword that can change into a weapon of unyielding power just by saying it's name. Rukia Kuchiki has a Zanpaktou called Sode No Shiryuiki, and Byakuya has one called Senbonzakura which can split into a billion blades. These alone give the anime a unique, awesome twist on a Shonen anime. Bleach has ended since 2012, but the manga is now in it's final arc. Please...PLEASE come back for that final arc! Pros: -A unique, compelling, funny and somewhat dark Shonen anime that is not afraid to show a bit of blood and gore here and there. -Memorable characters who will make you laugh and cry. -Very few plotholes are left in the anime, due to most of them being covered by the fillers (the fillers are not all that good though...see the cons) -A great soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu, also known for the soundtrack of Neo Genisis Evangelion -ZANPAKTOU MAN!!! Cons: -CAN'T STOP THIS FILLERRRRR! FILLER ALL NIGHT! Seriously, the fillers don't end... -The characters Jinta and Ururu are abandoned completely...it seemed like they were important...especially during the Arrancar arc, but now are just useless. -Art style is very basic. It brings nothing new to the table, other then perhaps cool monsters/demons Certification: Based on the story, art, sound, character and overall enjoyment, I give Bleach a Certified ++ rating for only the best anime. I really enjoyed this anime, and I am forever hoping it returns to our TV at some point or another. Reccomendations: Akame Ga Kill! - if your after the very style of action Bleach brings, this dark tale involving Assassins and a corrupt government is for you!

"This anime is basically a story about people who have a high sprit power and are able to see spirits/hallows/shinigami (death gods).

I like the many different plots and stories in each ark, but sometimes i with they would just stick to one plot and finish it. The art and sound were all great.

"In my opinion, Bleach (The first season) is arguably the best anime series in history. The story is gripping, the characters are so likeable it's unbelievable, and the fight scenes are as smooth and as epic as they come. The first season is the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, who is a young teen that has the ability to communicate with ghosts. After one such occurance, when a ghost was being attacked by a monster, Ichigo runs into Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper from the spirit &quot;realm&quot; of Sereitai, or Soul Society. After learning of Soul Reapers, saving his family, and even &quot;stealing&quot; Rukia's soul reaper powers, Ichigo and Rukia are confronted by the Soul Society's Gotei 13, or 13 Protection Squads. Rukia is sentanced to death, Ichigo doesn't like it, and so he goes to save Rukia from her fate. Pretty simple storyline, but the characters are so well done that you can actually feel the emotion dripping off them (well, if you watch the sub anyways...the dub gets kinda dry towards the middle of the series)",9,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_78387c4162,7,1029
"First of all, I'd like to say that Bleach was one of my FIRST anime, since I became interested in watching Anime. First was obviously Naruto, please I started watching Bleach soon after that. I came to realize that this was an Anime that I wouldn't want to stop, just because the story seemed never ending: infinite. However, alas, it ended so I would like to write up an actual review for it. Now I don't usually write reviews but since this is one of my all time favorite Anime, I thought I should. I'll start with the story. If you read the manga, then you should already know that there are some fillers arcs in Bleach, but for those who only watched the Anime, the story is pretty consistent and keeps the viewers actively entertained. It starts with Kurosaki Ichigo gains powers to protect his friends and family, and it begins to become so much more than just that. He comes to realize that some of his friends also have abilities and they tackle several problems to save humanity and protect the ones they love. I give the story an 8 because at some points, the story goes back into the past IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FINAL BOSS BATTLE (as a filler to allow the manga to catch up), and also because some filler arcs/episodes were really boring. The Art is something I can't really rate because I'm not too picky about it. So I'm going to give it a 10 just because I didn't dislike, but was rather pleased with the way the characters/environment/attack skills/etc were drawn and animated. Bleach has some pretty interesting background music. Of course, I'm not a hardcore fan so I don't take much interest in knowing all about the OSTs but the music was very well laid out in the anime. 10/10 for it! The characters were simply amazing. I really liked how they kept on evolving, and just as you think they couldn't evolve any further, something new popped up. One of the reasons why I hate the fact that this Anime is over is the characters! 10/10 for characters. This Anime was one I enjoyed the most of all the others. I must say that this doesn't beat Code Geass in my opinion, but it was definately one I saw EVERY WEEK, especially when fillers weren't going on. And one of the filler arc was VERY entertaining. Therefore, a 9/10. Overall, this was one of the best Anime I have ever seen. As much I'd like to give it an 8, because they ended it, I feel compelled to give it at least a 9.",9,Recommended,"Mar 25, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e65545f3f2,7,2393
"Word of forewarning with this Review: I am not rating Bleach for the fillers. I am strictly ignoring the fillers completely. I'll start in Chronological order as per rating listing here on the Review sheet. Also - A review is not based on how much you like the series, but it's based and grades on how well the series does at what it's genre is supposed to do. Not what YOU want it to do, or how YOU want it to develop. If you do not like the genre you SHOULD not rate it, because you will not be able to judge it for what it's worth, and that would be a SHOUEN Anime. Story: Shouen Anime. Before you judge a genre by its cover, you must first understand the target audience. Does the series deliver? Does the series stick to the manga? Does the story leave holes? Does the story disappoint? The series definitely delivers. There are plenty of enjoyable moments, it keeps you interested if you enjoy the genre, and it does everything the Genre does. If the series focused on love, romance and drama it would not deliver what it should as the genre it is. There are holes in the series. However right now they are existent because the anime has not reached the point in the manga the explains the holes ~ Thus there is nothing wrong here. Art: When grading art you must evaluate the quality of the artwork, how it emphases the scene, and how well it delivers the maximum potential of the series. Basically, you would not want Shoujo styled animation for a psychological series. When the series started it was in 4:3 ratio. Now it is in widescreen. The art was fine, the style of animation was generic and it delivered its point. It succeeds in providing the maximum impact of epicness when important scenes come up with heavy movement and animation. Once again - I am not grading filler arc animation as everyone knows the budget is cut during fillers thus mildly rushed animation is used. The art remains stable throughout the series, and it delivers enjoyable graphic entertainment. Does it push the bar above other series and use new rendering techniques and styles? No, it does not get a 10, but rather a 9. Sound: When rating the sound, you need to check for stock used loops, stocks and tracks. The soundtrack for bleach is great. Comical tracks, Emphatically Styled tracks, Battle theme music, and uniquely designed custom sounds for actions during the series. Does the sound and audio push harmony to its limits while blending with the art, scene, and seriousness of the series? Yes, but not all the time. It doesn't deserve a 10, yet does not deserve an 8 because it gets it's point across and remains completely enjoyable. The music is also nice, thus it gets a 9. Character: Once again, SHOUEN Anime. You are not to rate/grade the characters for their traits or uniqueness outside of the bounds of the genre they belong in. If the characters acted immature and comical in a horror series, it would not fit. However each of the characters in bleach remain unique in their own way, while allowing you to become attached to the character over time if not right away by how they act and react to situations. Bleach's characters are all completely different. From the War/Fighting crazy Kenpachi, to the cute and innocent Orihime, to the loud and boisterous bastard Grimmjow, to the typical character you might want to stab for acting like such a douche Uliqorra. Each character has their own traits, and does not appear generic. The most important Character, Ichigo, his character is perfect for the Hero of a SHOUEN series. Thus the characters get a 10. Enjoyment: Enjoyment grading should remain as unbiased as possible however this is clearly impossible since people have different taste which boil down to how much they enjoy something regardless of the quality of whatever they watch. Does the SHOUEN anime satisfy the genre by providing life lessons while showing scenes that enthrall the watcher into wanting to see the next 20 seconds in a mere instant because of interest? Yes. Does a series have to do this constantly? No, if it did the series would become chaotic and would be too dramatic and motionful to pay attention to, let alone understand what is going on. 10 for Enjoyment. Overall: 10, 9, 9, 10, 10 It gets a 10.",10,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3c7b261e6d,7,4238
"As one of the 'big three' I felt I had to watch it eventually, I've watched Naruto, and I've decided I can never watch One Piece for a few reasons. So, Bleach was on the hitlist. Story 9/10 - Some of the arcs in this series were truly epic, yeah the filler arcs were unwanted, but that's how it is with big anime. So I try to focus on the canon arcs and as I said, they are epic. The way it finished at ep366 was bittersweet, but I'm glad to hear the show is coming back! Art 8/10 - The characters and their swords/powers are all unique enough to make them distinguishable, which is always a good thing. The world is a little dull, but I've seen worse. I will admit though, as the years went by, the art style became 10 times better. Sound 10/10 - Easily the stand out part of the anime, the intros are mostly awesome, but where it shines is the battle music, the great orchestral instruments make the fights seem so emotional and brilliant. Yes, definitely the greatest in-show music I’ve witnessed in anime. Character 8/10 - Many of the character, whether protagonists or antagonists are full of style and emotion, they are fun. The only downside is that they are all arrogant and believe far too much in their own power no matter what. There is decent character development throughout. Enjoyment 9/10 - There's plenty of action, comedy, suspense, everything you need really in an anime. If anything it's a little too fast paced. Overall 9/10 - A great anime that has undoubtedly inspired newer anime (such as demon slayer.) Not many anime can go on for so long and keep the viewers interested. Bleach holds a special place with it's viewers where, it isn't anyone's favourite anime, but not many people dislike it.",9,Recommended,"May 22, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_156046ed01,7,1717
"There are not many series as popular as Bleach, but this truly deserves a recommendation. The story about the Main character, who becomes a Soul Reaper, has really been worked out well. When you go further in the series, after about 25 episodes, you are already feeling with the main character Ichigo. As you go further in the series, the more battles you'll get, and the more of the fun will start. The good part is that it's not always serious and that there are many times when humor is brought forward. Ofcourse it ain't always perfect, and therefore i'd say the only not fitting part of the story are the fillers in the serie. Tite Kubo has made a great effort in all the artwork. He created an environment in which the story perfectly fit, and the characters are drawn very nice. The 3 world are so well worked out, that you know exactly when they are in the real world, the world of the hollows or the world of the soul reapers. I think the best part of the serie is the music. The mood is all set by the music, and they fit that so perfectly well, that I'd say it's even worth watching just for the music. My personal opinion about the serie is that you should just watch, and if you still don't like it after more than 30 episodes, you shouldn't continue, but just give it a try. If you do, I'll promise it will be better, even though you may not always like the fillers.",9,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b168ee6d48,7,1380
"This series is undoubtly the first ever anime series that ive watched. It sparked my interest and before long, taking me deeper into the world of Japanese Animation. Now, it is one of the best, to me, of all the current ongoing anime series that i am following. The story just keeps escalating and i am itching to read the manga. Awesome characters with unique individual powers and outrageously powerfull enemies. Every battle the protagonist goes into, Kurosaki Ichigo, seems like one where he will never win. Of course, good always triumph over evil, so he and his comrades manages from time to time. Sadly, the inevitable series killer ie, fillers, have also began to infect this once filler-free series.(lol) To me, it survived this phase as the story quality of the first fillers are, surprisingly to say, entertaining. Unlike some series that im sure millions of you out there know of. Although, the second phase of fillers didnt quite meet my expectations.

"My review has a few spoilers from earlier seasons (maybe up to season 4), so beware... The first season of Bleach was great. It had school life, it had an interesting supernatural story going on, humour, short battles with good animation, and music unlike anything I've heard in other anime - stuff that sends chills down your spine and really fits the series. Really, it was just amazing. The opening theme was also just above standards. Words can't describe how unique and enjoyable it was, plus it was a good song. That red/white/blue theme they had Ichigo dressed in... Really, just an outstanding fashion statement. People today wear dark colours that kinda blend together, but that stuff really stood out just like Ichigo's orange hair and HUGE sword. All that AND this was a sweet samurai-type show? Awesome! Most of the other opening themes are also pretty cool, but not in the same way the first opening was. When a menos showed up, that was some creepy stuff, had my hairs standing up. Everything was just perfect and the series looked promising. Anyhow, that stuff was off the hook. Then Rukia got taken away and things started going downhill from there... We lost the school life and supernatural parts of the show forever, and those were some of my favourite parts. Season 2 introduced many interesting characters to us and had some cool stuff, but it was kinda getting dull and straying from a story to just senseless fighting. By the time it was over, the show was still alright, but nowhere near as kickass as the first season. ... And things continued to go downhill. Worse than that, we got fillers. Fillers that were exact copies of YuYu Hakusho. Seriously, that thing where Ichigo and friends went up against Nova (he looked cool) and those other two doll things... It was exactly like when Yusuke and friends went up against those other supernatural kids in town. In the end, it was Urahara's idea of training them, just like in YuYu Hakusho how it was Genkai's plan. The show became dull... it became a copy of Dragonball Z. It's just pointless, dragged on fighting in wastelands and deserts. The enemy will have a clear advantage, the Ichigo will have a huge opening, what will the enemy do? Kick Ichigo into a nearby mountain, crumbling it and leaving Ichigo to push a boulder off of his body and have some blood running down his forehead over his eye. In season 2 when Ichigo fought Madarame, they actually made a fuss about that blood, and I thought that was kinda cool, but now it's just the same ol' DBZ shit. This show has become a total joke. The swords they use are merely for show. They never cut each other; only kick each other. You can't even cut someone like Kenpachi just because he has a strong will; it's ridiculous. Why do they use swords at all? They occasionally stab through or slice each other a little, fine... they could probably do that without the swords, though. It's not even the sword so much that does anything; it's the characters themselves. Speaking of which, what's with Ichigo's bankai? He gets a swastika guard on his sword and it turns small and black... Yeah, great. It looks kinda cool, but it doesn't do anything. Anyhow, it's just boring. It's a series that heavily relies on the battle scenes, but even those are dull since the swords are useless. There are rare occasions when the show is funny or interesting, but it's really not worth it. There are loads of amazing anime series that are only 13 or 24 episodes. Those series can actually make you feel some emotion and make you really laugh, but Bleach is just lame. The Bleach movies also suck and use the same storyline that the fillers use (a long lost shinagami wants revenge!). The show should've stayed like how it was in season 1.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 29, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45c0697c5f,7,3754
"Fan Rating: 9/10 Critic Rating: 5/10 Unfortunately, I have to consider Bleach dropped. Once the whole Aizen mess wrapped up, I completely lost interest. I am happy the ending of that whole storyline could easily have served as a series ending. I am content to say Ichigo and his friends lived happily ever after and ignore the fact the series just keeps going and going and going. I did some research on the manga's later arcs, and I did find myself intrigued by the back story concerning Ichigo's parents. Although, it also struck me as being a little too soapy. I don't know. I may have to give the manga a shot. Anyway, from a fan perspective, this series is a delight. Unfortunately, after the Bount Saga, the overall quality of the main arcs weaken. However, there are still iconic moments. It's just too difficult to weigh the pros and cons. For all of the tedious filler, it often felt worth it just to get to Ulquiorra vs. Ichigo, or the revelation of Gin, or many other amazingly heart wrenching moments. Still, after the first two arcs, the parts seem greater than the whole. Stunning sequences, but overall weak story structures. The filler arcs were mostly not that bad. The Bounts I thought was amazing, and I did not know at first it was filler because it fit in with the continuity. The themes of oppression, of denying a minority group, led to complex characters who at times really did make me tear up. Anime excels at making the political personal. Yoshino and ideas of motherhood, cult personality vs. individuality, and martyrdom opened my heart and mind. However, the series is so long, I'm not sure if I will be rewatching anytime soon to expound on those ideas. And still, there are some gender issues. The main female characters, Orihime and Rukia, are way too sacrificial and weak. Rukia is more interesting as a character study. But I just couldn't with Orihime. At first, I was interested in how she wanted to be stronger, then in how to make her healing powers, a passive power, work in a culture that values active aggression. However, her sacrificing moment was annoying. I know she's not meant to be an Einstein, but the fact that one stupid decision lead to such a huge story arc with so freakin' many episodes, one my absolute favorite, is bittersweet. And yet still, her confrontation with jealously shows how strong her heart is (even if often to the setback of her friends). The filler arcs are usually too slow in the beginning and wonderfully epic in their ending. The Captain Amagai arc was the worst upfront. The Muramasa arc became redundant in the middle as the same characters used the same powers over and over and the epilogue arc with the Sword Beasts brought the overall quality down further. Still, the proper ending was philosophical and beautiful. Again, Bleach's highs and lows are in constant dual with me. There were too many arrancars. I am happy the filler arcs were there, but they were all too long. If this whole series were edited down, it would have been a masterpiece. Instead, it's a personal favorite that is good with often extended moments of poignant beauty. Some more thoughts: The overall world building has some shaky ideas. The citizens of the Soul Society act like they are a completely different race from humans; yet they really are just humans that have died. Their estrangement with the living does not often make sense. Also, the series was difficult to adjust to at first. In the beginning, the stories are episodic. Each episode has Ichigo battling a hollow, and the story lines build, getting bigger. Once they enter the social society, I could not believe how decompressed the storytelling became. Battles took on many episodes. Once I skipped ahead to see how long before the Soul Society Arc ended. When I got the gist, I settled into it and enjoyed. Like the iconic, and often templated, DBZ, Bleach works on a power up model. For some this might be tedious. However, it did not bother me, mainly because of the drama and conflict provided by Ichigo's dark side. Like many in this genre, the sheer charisma of the characters and the epic spectacles which each have their own (often more interesting) stories kept me from probing the holes too deeply. Unfortunately, the inability to close read the world building without it falling apart leads to a low critic score.",7,Recommended,"Oct 24, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f91b9085eb,7,4349

"This is an anime series with more than 300+ episodes and the name of the anime is totally unimportant and irrelevant to the story. Story : This anime has no plot by any means, simply an unending stream of battles with no point, hung together with adversaries getting a adjustment in appearance in every new battle. The battles are as faltering as they can get : An arbitrary character will be running and another person will show up in their path for reasons unknown. At that point it will cut into a flashback demonstrating that they were companions like 10 years back. At that point they will talk for 20 minutes and afterward begin battling. They'll battle for like...7 scenes? At that point they will claim to have been holding back and going easy and then the two character will start shouting and yelling at each other. The fundamental character, Ichigo Kurosaki transforms into a reptile. Wtf? The art is great. Sound is decent. 1/10 Overall.

The characters had potential and ichigo is prolly the best protagonist from the big three. The best part of this show is prolly the world building which is actually pretty good imo.

"Bleach... has everything you're looking for in an anime/manga. Story: Outstanding. Like many anime series, it does start off a bit slow, but as usual, this is needed to develop the story into something greater. Remember if an anime doesn't have a strong and developed foundation, then it's not going to be able to develop a deep and long lasting story that actually makes sense. YES, there are mini-filler series after each story-arc, but this was needed to keep it from catching the manga. Also, many people advice skipping the filler episodes, but I would highly advise against it. My reasoning for this, is character depth, and a change of pace that gives you something lighter to enjoy for a short time before getting back into another deep and serious story arc. I think you may get slightly burned out on constant life & death struggles if you skip them. Also, some of them were actually really great, and most were very funny. I felt there was a little too much silliness from time to time, but remember this series is meant to attract 13 year olds as well. Also... while yes action and storyline is the ""main attraction"" (theme song you'll hear a lot in main battles), there IS actually an interesting love triangle thing going on, just hints here and there, but enough to make Shoujo anime fans appreciate it and enjoy. (I mention this as some have said there is no romance, including the writer, which isn't the case). Character: This is the TRUE strong point for me in Bleach, I REALLY love these characters... not just the main character, or the 3 characters you see the most, but most all of the characters, as they are so different and interesting... I'm a hardcore Light side/good guy fan, but I even found myself finding redeeming qualities in the bad guys... they kind of show how they became that way, and you feel kind of sorry for them, and the ones who have to die... or possibly not die... as is the case with Grimmjow (you'll see, ). Yes Ichigo is awesome, but I have to say, Kenpachi Zaraki is just so cool... And MY personal favorite, is and always will be Sui-Feng (soifon)!!! I claim her, she's mine. Animation: Early in season 1, the animation is around a 6 or 7, kind of meh... but it doesn't take long before it steps up it's game and becomes an 8 or 9, and quite beautiful. So just bear with it for the first few episodes before animation alone pushes you away. Voice acting & Music: One of the best I've experienced. Voice acting for both dubbed and original is fantastic, I personally couldn't ask anymore from it. Music soundtrack is spectacular, the intro and credits song changes every season, and it ALWAYS grows on you, fight music is great, slow music is great... you'll appreciate it. I've watched my fair share of good anime as is evident from my list, and I'm pretty fair with my scoring, and I have so many that I really loved, and I know a lot of people just insta-troll and call fanboy, but in all seriousness, it's really great, and I feel that if you didn't at least watch one full season before quitting it, then you really missed out and I don't feel you can accurately judge the series otherwise, making your point rather invalid... My final point is... Anime series DO NOT last this long unless they are pretty good overall, I've seen too many series that only go 13 episodes, or 1 or 2 seasons when they are soooo amazing and deserve more time... THIS is one that got more time, and really made it a good ride. The anime recently ended... for no reason, since it's killing the market, and the manga is still going and just reached what is adding up to be the best story arc yet... I can't believe that something so epic won't reach animation, so I expect the series to be picked back up soon.",10,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4c9f6c4ea3,8,3744
"Bleach First of all Bleach is a good anime with a lot of action and comedy, but the filler sucks. Story: Bleach is about Kurosaki Ichigo, he’s 16-years old. Ichigo can see spirits, so he is special.

Then a monster appear and the Shinigami is struggling against it, then she and Ichigo agrees to stab Ichigo in his stomach….

The art is nothing special, it’s like Naruto, Bleach etc.. . Sound: Good openings and endings. The voice characters does a good job. Hitsugaya Toushiro has an awesome voice!! All the voices are awesome. Characters: The characters have a unique personality, and you will like them. Like all the other shounen series there is always two characters who are arguing each others and fight.

"Firstly, I started watching anime in about 2003, with Sailor Moon. After that, I branched off to other animes. However, when I discovered my best friend obsessed with Bleach, I decided I would never read or watch it, since I believed it was just another of those mainstream animes which would let me down. Besides, I always thought the hero would go around taking himself way to seriously. So, I avoided it like the plague, until 2009, when a new friend finally convinced me to watch it. What was so brilliant about this anime, that attracts every animefreak around, and makes up 76% of anime conventions? So, I went home and watched episode 1. In three days straight, I'd watched 64 episodes, non-stop. I was right; Kurosaki DOES take himself way to seriously. Why am I telling you this lifestory? Sorry to bore you, but I'm writing this review to tell you why you should watch and read Bleach, right? I've not watched many animes, I admit, compared to quite a few people here. However, ever had that feeling when you see the first episode of an anime or drama and think, 'Wow, I want to see what happens next!' or 'This is sooo awesome!'? Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Bleach. When a Hollow (spirit eating monsters), attacks 15 year old Kurosaki Ichigo's family one night, his life changes forever. Turned into a shinigami (Death God) and granted the power to rid his town of these evil beings, Kurosaki goes out to save to world. Cliché much? No kidding. The underlying plotline: save the world IS...cliché and, to a limit, exasperating.

"Synopsis: Ichigo Kurosaki seems to be a regular highschool student, except for the fact that he has been able to see and talk to ghosts since he was a kid. One day, his house is attacked by a malevolent spirit, known as a hollow. He’s saved by Rukia Kuchiki a shinigami sent to kill the hollow and protect the living. Rukia fails to defeat the Hollow, and instead places her hopes on Ichigo, to whom she transfers her powers. After defeating the beast, Ichigo is saddled with the responsibility of protecting his town from evil spirits with Rukia as his mentor. Pros: Amazing fight scenes with cool powers and villains. The characters are amazingly well done in terms of character design. There is a variety of powers and abilities. And all around just a badass show. Cons: 1/3 of the 366 episodes are fillers albeit not all were bad. The fact that the anime got cancelled and never decided to animate that last arc of the story.(If you want to check out the manga after the you finish the anime read chapter from 479) Bleach has in my opinion the 2nd highest amount of plot armor in anime, losing 1st to Fairy Tail. There are 3 worlds and yet there is hardly any world building. Ichigo actually only has one move :/ (Getsugaaaaaa Tenshooooo) Weird pacing issues, mainly due to the fact that Shounen Jump was rushing Tite Kubo to finish. And oh God that fucking ending!!!!(Referring to the manga) So I'd still recommend Bleach to anyone who is trying to get into anime or to someone who likes action/shounen battle anime. Bleach does have 336 epsiodes so it is a bit time consuming. But if you skip all the filler it's only 200 episodes. http://www.animefillerlist.com/shows/bleach",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a7a35463b0,8,1681
"The first arc is very good. The Arrancar arc is what kind of ruined it for me. They introduced some of the most annoying characters I ever seen in anime (Nel, Dondachaka and that other idiot that followed the main cast around) Some of the fight scenes were dragged out way to long for fodder uninteresting Arrancar. The only interesting Arrancar introduced were Grimmjow and Ulquiorra. Oh and one thing I ABSOLUTELY HATE IS WHEN THEY TELL EACH OTHER ALL OF THEIR ABILITIES IN DETAIL FOR LIKE HALF THE F**** EPISODE. Some of the fights seem dragged out for no reason. I absolutely hate orihime she is such a horrible character, why would you rehash a rescue arc all over again??? I can’t believe she snuck in ichigo’s room while he was sleeping and tried to sexually assault him in sleep lol. Oh yeah Ichigo..... this dude has so much plot armor it’s ridiculous. Yeah he gets his a** beat a lot but then he pulls something out his a** to win. He also gets stronger out of the blue sometimes and it makes no sense. I really wanted to finish this series because I like most of the soul reaper captains / lieutenants. I wanted to see Aizen fight, but I just can’t continue this show anymore. Soi Fons fat a** lieutenant is so annoying I just skip every scene he is in.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 20, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5307fd79e6,8,1264
"Okay sooo Bleach was one of my all time favorite mainstream animes and i am HIGHLY disappointed that they ended the anime b4 the Manga was completed. Never the less, this anime brought out some amazing characters with outstanding abilities, (namely Byakuya with his Senbonzakura). Half of the fillers were fairly decent, which is quite rare, and somewhat entertaining. I say if you have the time and wanna see a new spin on sword play, watch Bleach.

"Bleach is an interesting and exciting anime thats loses youserlf in the middle of a lot of fillers, lazy or lack of character development, very convenient use or lack of powers and rules that can be easily broken if the character is just stronger. Story: 6/10 It starts really good, but uses repetitive justifications as an answer for every challange, some characters at the end say that Ichigo never change and its literally true, he NEVER changes despite getting more and more powers and all of it just seens so easily given that its so frustating sometimes. Tite Kubo couldn't get tired of the formula fight + almost die fighting + get new boss power = show up with a badass face like a imortal shinigami that crushes the enemy. There's those powers that show up saving the day without never being mentioned before, enemys that often get weaker when they should get stronger, because they JUST got a new power or transformation, but no, not enough to defeat Ichigo. Also, there's those enemys with abysmal powers that forget a little of it after some episodes, like THIS ONE that's absolutely so broken and stop being used by THAT GUY after he gets his ""god transformation"" and everyone stops worring about it when they were worried about it for almost 300 episodes. However, fights are great even if you take all of this in consideration, at least most of them, some are just boring fights from characters that nobody cares. Bleach also has a lot of fillers arcs that show up in the middle of the main stuff, so watching this every week should have been hell, gladly its mostly arcs and not one filler + one canon + one filler + one canon like other anime did, THAT was definitively torture. Art: 7/10 While some characters designs are awful, most of them are unique and brings a lot of charisma to the anime. Animation is at least good 99% of the time, without memorable deformations. Sound: 9/10 Openings are good in general, soundtrack is a highlight that Studio Pierrot seens to love. Bleach's soundtrack seens to focus on the greatness of fights. which fits very well, because empowered fights is the best that Bleach has to offer. Character: 6/10 The development of characters is basic for most of them, what's frustating is that supposedly big characters end up having very poor explanations on some cases, so the animes lacks pay off for watching so many episodes hoping to get just a spark of development that justifies why they do what they do. Some characters that have excellent designs are so shallow and the development that matters stays with the main protagonist for the first arc, then there are just sparks between a lot of good fights. There's no deep in emotions and not much time to know characters, because the anime is fast paced despite having 366 episodes and what is given isn't convincing enough. Enjoyment: 6/10 Bleach in fun to watch, but don't go waiting for strong connection with characters. The anime doesn't seen to care about wasting time getting at the heart of the viewer and there's not much effort here besides trying to deliver amazing fights at the end. Most of the characters that show up a lot or a little are barely emotionally developed for more than a few episodes or a few minutes, they are cool because of design or attitude and that's it, but there's a lot of uninteresting ones and it's hard to even care about the fight if you think both characters fighting are boring.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 5, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e7591ff26b,8,3424
"I really enjoyed Aizen as an antagonist, also the animation for the whole Arrancar arc. One thing that i didn't like about bleach is that there was too many fillers for me but i got used to it and skipped a lot of them and everything but that fact Bleach is really good. The characters are so well done, Especially Aizen and Shinji they were so good i loved all of the episodes with them in it. Another + in Bleach is the openings, I love op 13, 2, 1, 12, etc. Another thing i kinda disliked about Bleach was the sudden power ups for the MC but i dont entirely hate the fact because it makes the fights 20X better.",9,Recommended,"Jan 10, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_91e4f3fc98,8,614

NOT SPOILER Bleach is not possible to compare with Naruto and One Piece as many others do. It's the same as if you would have compared LordOfTheRings with Harry Potter. Bleach has a special story that develops more and more. It is easy to love the characters and there is always something going on but sometimes it becomes too much of something that is not full so exciting which can do that it gets a little boring so therefore I can not give 10/10.

"I wanted to avoid this for some time since this anime is/was very popular and there are many different opinions about it, but....here goes. Story: 7/10 When I first saw Bleach, I thought the story was very interesting, with the Shinigamis and Hollows and all that. It promised to be a nice story. However, the story started slow (really slow). It went something along the lines of ""Hey you are a Soul Reaper, here's a Hollow, go and reap it"" until episode 20 or so. Then it started to become more interesting with the Soul Society Arc. After that, boy oh boy. The story takes a nose dive. It becomes a mindless shounen with the premise that the main character is the only one who can save the Soul Society blah blah blah (where have I heard this before.) Not to mention this anime has fillers galore. Art: 7/10 Nothing special. The animations are good at best and the bland backgrounds don't help either. Sound: 8/10 Nothing extraordinary, but nothing bad either. The soundtracks fit the fight well and add to it in it's own sense. Some of the OST, especially in the beginning, are bad, but after that they get pretty good. Also never understood the composer's fixation with spanish-inspired music Character: 5/10 Easily the worst flaw in Bleach. Starting from the main character, his personality is next to nonexistent. Just random ""I will save everyone"" speeches and going to save people that are in danger solely for him to go save them. Ichigo doesn't develop as a character during 350+ episodes and remains the same ""energetic guy"" who wants to save his friends even though, throughout the series he barely even talks with them. The supporting cast is severely lacking in character development also. Be it Ishida, Chad, Rukia or Orihime (oh god, not her), no one develops as a character and remains the same one since when they were first introduced. Character design is lacking in imagination. All Shinigami have the black robe (Captains have a white vest over it), which makes it feel like the author isn't even trying to make interesting and unique character designs. Also the bad guys (Espadas) are all white. Enjoyment: 8/10 Despite it's major flaws, Bleach managed to entertain me for quite a while. Maybe because I have a soft spot for sword fighting in general. The series also had some humorous parts during the first seasons, which I liked, but then, as the series progressed, it became more and more difficult for me to like it because of the above-mentioned flaws. To summarize: (+) Interesting story (+) Cool fights (-) Mediocre character development (-) ""I must save every one"" cliche (-) Bad pacing of story and fights. (-) Fillers galore. You actually need a list to know what to watch and what to skip.",7,Recommended,"Sep 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_73e4e2d980,8,2724
"Well, i won't bore you with the whole plot details, so here we go: Story - 8.7/10 (B+) The show really does take off from episode 1, and the way in which Ichigo meets Rukia is just really well done, not amazing, but better than i expected. It's a little sluggish at the beginning, but not to worry, only some dry humor to worry about. The way the story is told makes you feel like you're a part of this whole drama. Animation - 8.3/10 (B) Bleach has fairly good animation, especially the Bankai of all the Captains, including Ichigo's. It doesn't blow me away, but it doesn't disappoint, either. Sound - 7.9/10 (C+) Bleach can really nail it when it comes to comedic scenes, but when it comes to boss fights (Ex. Byakuya vs Ichigo), it kinda sucked. I heard the song that was playing and nearly choked on how bad it sounded and how it couldn't even fit. Now, not all of it is bad, but when you have memorable/important fights, you kinda want to remember the song played too. Characters - 9.5/10 (A) Holy crud, Bleach has a ton of characters. But they do a good job with giving each character a fair amount of airtime, given that Bleach is a long-running show. A short summary of the characters are: The Gotei 13, Karakura Town Residents (Ex. Urahara), Soul Society, Hueco Mundo (Ex. Espada's, Menos). But so far, they've all had their time to shine. Enjoyment - 10/10 (A+) I'm currently on Episode 200, i have watched every single episode and i might sound like a Narutard but: I love this show! I can never stop watching this!, It's the longest show i've watched, the most entertaining and enjoyable show so far. None of these new shows won't suffice. Bleach has always been compared to Naruto, but (as a Bleach fan) Naruto is LEAGUES away from Bleach. It can never obtain the well-told plot, it's remarkable and hated characters, it's concept of blending Japanese with Spanish (Hueco Mundo, Espadas) cultures and the overall better fights that Bleach can make. The fillers are more bearable than Naruto's, believe it. (pun intended) Overall Averaged: 8.8/10 (B+) The Good: A great introduction to the series, the massively large cast that actually has a purpose (unlike Naruto) of being there. The emotions of the characters gets to you fast. The Bad: Choice of music during great fights. For example the incredibly long Byakuya vs Ichigo fight: the music really made me gag, no seriously. Had a slight case of &quot;Naruto Filler Syndrome&quot;, only not as much filler.",8,Recommended,"Jan 5, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b595d72217,8,2473
"I discovered bleach by watch the dubbed version on television and at first glance i was not that impressed. Dragon Ball Z being my first anime ever watched, my view of shounen anime and most anime in general had pretty much been destroyed. Soon after that i began to watch the show subbed and my view of Bleach changed significantly. Sadly I still think the episodes building up to the Soul Society arc still are not that impressive. The beginning of Bleach starts out pretty how all other mainstream shounen anime starts out. Guy with strange hair is able to see spirits and soon discovers that there are bad spirits (Hollow) who eat souls that have yet to pass on into a place called the Soul Society and there are Shinigami who kill hollow and save the soul who have not passed yet. Main character Ichigo, who is: stubborn, quick to anger, protects his friends, not always the sharpest spoon in the drawer; obtains Shinigami powers and begins his fate of saving the world several times. I am very pleased to say however that the very crude synopses above does not give Bleach proper justice. From the Soul Society arc onward, despite the filler arcs, Bleach hosts a wide variety characters; all with their own unique backgrounds and positions in and out of the Soul Society. Bleach Plot doesn't simply translate into main character and friends go through the ladder of bad guys and get their ass handed to by main evil boss. Shortly followed by main protagonist pulling something out of his ass to save the day and then wait for an even stronger bad guy to appear. In each arc of the Bleach series there is unique goal that Ichigo and friends try to accomplish. And the protagonist is not always the most powerful when said goal is accomplished, leaving room for growth and character development. Even when the main cast of characters obtain new powers they often gain a new perspective with that power. Overall the show delivers many plot twists and a complex history of both the soul society and the hollow world. Another aspect of Bleach that drew me in was the complexity of the enemy forces, they are not simply just hollow but various level of hollow and the birth of the Arrancar, etc. It is true that Bleach in recent time has started to drag on and maybe it is time to just leave it after this arc is over. Despite what many will say Bleach is not just another long and annoying shounen anime. It is most certainly a step above the rest and a must watch.

"As a long-time fan of shounen shows and mangas, I dare to say I was heavily depressed with bleach, for the fact the fights are way too boring and uncreative, and would make other shounen artists like Hirohiko Araki or Togashi Yoshihiro facepalm in dissapointment. it doesnt help either that the story backgrounds lack feelings or resolve, you wont feel inspiration or excitement in these fights. its no longer about comparing it to One piece or naruto which are the hot popular stuff now, bleach even pales to classic shounen tales like Rurouni kenshin, Jojo, Yuyu hakusho or Saint seya, or other underlooked mangas like kenichi, soul eater or full metal alchemist. there is just no feelings here, just pretentiousness and simplistic mindless fights coated with good artwork and &quot;attractive&quot; characters.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 17, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_30928c8168,9,813
"As with all long-running series, I think you have to judge Bleach differently than a tightly-woven short-story. Shows like Bleach and Naruto are simply constructed differently than Madoka or Steins;Gate. An anime that follows on ongoing manga plays a different role, it's meant to build a fan-base, and to continue to layer new stories on top of a concept for a long, long time. Yes, this is partly a shameless commercial exercise, but it also lets us have something reliable to read or watch every week. So let's give Bleach credit where it is due. This is a great shonen with some truly unforgettable moments. First off, the character designs are amazing. The clothing, in particular, is always impressive, and I think Kubo could have been a fashion designer if he had wanted to. The size of the cast is impressive, and even moreso when you consider how distinct each squad (and each squad's leaders) appear. Second, the show was able to take some very, very generic concepts and reforge them into something that felt unique and fresh. The show is more-or-less a patchwork of Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball Z, and (insert any high-school fighting anime here) - but it works! Third, the show did not let the main character hog all the screen time. You know your generic shonen hero is successful when the audience really wants him to kick someone's ass, and I felt this way on multiple occasions. However, I think one sign of a BAD shonen protagonist is that he has to stick his nose into every fight and plot-line. Bleach avoids this, with tons of quality fights between other characters, while still giving Ichigo the spotlight. Fourth, Ichigo may be overly-confident at times, but he's not a brainless dolt riding high on childishness. He's a bit more mature, and this is a good thing from my point of view. I prefer a cool character with the occasional sense of humor to an always-aloof prodigy. Fifth, many of the fights were magnificently choreographed. There are easily 20 fights in Bleach that you could re-watch dozens of times in your life, without ever getting bored of them. That said, there were problems, even given the nature of a long-running shonen: First off, the show indisputably peaked in the Soul Society arc. Considering how long ago this was, that's a genuine problem. This arc had everything, and it was one of the best arcs in a shonen ever, but nothing after this point ever came close. Second, Ichigo's friends were left in the dust when he made new allies. I think the most tragically under-developed character is Orihime. While everyone else gets incredibly strong compared to their early incarnations, Orihime is forever reduced to being a ""healer"" (although that's not the true nature of her power). Third, the fights in Bleach start to follow a set formula after a while. This is a major flaw. It becomes apparent that ""whoever uses their full power first loses,"" and ""you cannot die until your back-story episode has run."" Fourth, Kubo is undeniably lazy when it comes to background art. White backgrounds EVERYWHERE. It's as if they were... Bleached! In conclusion, Bleach is a great long-running shonen series that certainly deserved its spot as part of the ""big three."" Now that it is coming to an end once and for all, I am genuinely going to miss it. However, even I have to admit that it is probably the right time for Kubo to move on. The series has been slowly devolving into something that is rather boring, and I would rather remember the good moments. Perhaps Kubo will even come up with something even better in the future.",7,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_117dc685b4,9,3566
"At the begining the theme and story were great; Shinigamis (Simular to Grim reapers. Though they look more like a fusion between a Samurai and Grim reaper), and the Zanpaktou was a great and original idea. At the begining i loved this anime, especially after episode 15 (or 16 when Ichigo first fights Renji) from there I was hooked on. Bleach continued to surprise me every episode, from the Soul Society arc right through to the build-up to Hueco Mundo. But that all stopped when they actually entered Hueco Mundo. From then on (in my opinion) the story started degrading as every episode started to be nothing but fighting. Ichigo has a fight, Renji has a fight blablabla, once they've beaten that person then another person comes along (straight away) and another fight starts. Its gotten so repetative that these days i actually look foward to Bleach fillers. The art and animation of Bleach is good (if Bleach is going to be fight after fight then they have to make sure they atleast have good animated fights). Bleaches characters i love. Every character has something unique to them and they don't steriotype (i.e some animes that make all the females useless people that stand around and rely on the men). Plus i love the fact that they don't base the anime around just the main character but instead most of the characters get quite abit of spotlight. Personally i don't like Ichigo but that doesn't matter because i get to see quite alot of my other favorite characters in Bleach. Other animes i would end up hating because i don't like the main character and everything is based on the main character. I don't get as much enjoyment out of Bleach as i used to but it still entertains me abit.

"Bleach is amazing! Are there a few problems with this anime? Yes, there are. But I believe the pros far outweigh the cons. Easily Bleach's biggest strength, at least in my opinion, are its characters. Never before in any show have I seen such a well put-together cast. The cast is very large--you have Ichigo, Rukia, and a few of Ichigo's close friends, who comprise of the main cast. But beyond them, you also have the 13 court guard squads, the visoreds, the arrancars...and many more. Many of these less-important side characters, even if they don't get quite as much screentime, still feel very well fleshed out and have unique and memorable designs and personalities. Shuhei and Sajin are my personal favorites. Although the plot gets a bit convoluted at times, I think it still tells a good story. The main villain, whose name is (SPOILER), and the members of his army are very intimidating and sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. There are several interesting plot twists throughout the story as well. And, despite what most people say about the Fullbringer arc, I personally really enjoyed it. The animation looks amazing, the plot is solid, and it felt like the perfect epilogue for Ichigo's story. Some fight scenes drag on for much too long (Renji and Uryu vs. Szayelaporro comes to mind) but overall the fights in Bleach are very action packed and enjoyable. The characters all have a variety of special abilities, ensuring that each fight will be a unique matchup. The music is good too! I love the opening themes, especially 12, 13, and 15. MY THOUGHTS ON BLEACH'S FILLER: Although a lot of people have a rather negative opinion on the filler episodes, I actually found (most) of them to be quite enjoyable. The first filler arc, the Bount arc, dragged on for too long and was mildly entertaining at best, but the other three filler arcs are pretty solid, as are many of the standalone episodes (287 and 304 are especially funny!) The only thing that is a bit irritating to me is the fact that the middle two filler arcs--the Shusuke Amagai and Zampakuto arcs--don't really fit into continuity that well. Both of these arcs aired in the middle of the manga arcs and therefore had to be set to take place at a different point in time. (as opposed to the first and fourth filler arcs, which aired AND took place in-between the manga arcs.) Unfortunately, there isn't a place in the story's timeline where either arc can fit in without at least some plot holes being created in the process, at least as far as I can tell. I think they fit best taking place sometime between episode 310 and 342, although there are still a few minor issues with this. The fourth filler arc, the reigai arc, is easily the best (the ending just about brought tears to my eyes) and fits in perfectly with continuity, so it for sure earns my badge of approval.",9,Recommended,"Sep 23, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_19b25dc623,9,2856
"Being one of the 3 mainstream manga/anime, between One Piece and Naruto, I'd have to be inclined to say Bleach is the best. This is my opinion, however. Also - my first review. Please don't be too harsh. In regards to story, I gave it a 7/10. Soul Society and Heuco Mundo arcs were fairly well done with a unique plot and, in my opinion a pretty decent villian. What brought it down anymore is the current arc, and a few of the fillers in the anime such as the Bount arc which have no real decent effect on the story. Art wise 10/10. Tite has drastically improved his artwork, and mostly everyone can agree its a lot better than a lot of other manga artwork. This goes for the anime too. Sound 9/10. In the anime, I think the sound is done well, with good VA's in the Japanese version, with only a few who just don't match. Characters 9/10. Most can be fairly relateable since there are so many. If you don't like a lot of them, chances are you'll like at least one of them. Though some of them have little relevence to the story, like filler characters who show up in the anime, or Don Kanonji. 9/10 for enjoyment. For people who like a good shonen manga, or anime in general, I would reccomend this one for sure. 9/10 overall. Bleach has been one of my favourites for a long time, and I like most of the characters, and the story. I'll admit right now the manga is a bit stale, but with Bleach's lovely artwork, variety of characters, I think it's one of the best ones out there.",9,Recommended,"Aug 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b6f3b43d93,9,1481
"Bleach. What can I say? You either like it or hate it. I loved Bleach. I've never done anything like this, this is my first review so please go easy on me guys! I'm not going to do a ""traditional"" review. I'm not going to give a rating on Bleach based on how good it was, I am going to give a review on Bleach based on how much I enjoyed it. It may be bias to you but I don't care this is my review, I'll do things my way. Bleach isn't a perfect anime nor will it ever be. It actually has many flaws, the most noted one is the amount of fillers. Note that I skipped just about all the fillers. I'm doing this review based on the canon stuff from Bleach which I enjoyed a lot. Bleach was the anime that got me back into anime. I stopped watching anime in my last year of Middle School which was in the 2007/2008 year. I was fairly familiar with the Bleach anime. I used to watch it sometimes on TV. I remember the hype of 3 animes back then in 2006/2007 , Naruto (which I was a huge fan of and always watched back then), Bleach (which I watched on TV sometimes and tried to watch online to get into) and One Piece (which I watched on TV, the 4kids version). Long story short, I could never really get into Bleach. I had plans to ""one day"" watch and catch up with Bleach because of the hype (and One Piece also). 5 years later in February of 2013, in my final year of High School in my Civilization class my teacher would sometimes talk about anime and I kept getting this weird sensation to watch Bleach it was like an itch. Something was telling me to watch Bleach, I kept remembering it in class. I kept imagining Ichigo killing ghosts. So I started watching Bleach, I gave the series time and I began to really love it. I took a lot of breaks with it though but a year later (February 2014) I finished it. I will always love Bleach and one of the reasons was for it restoring my love back in anime. I love the story, characters, music, fights, art and most of all I enjoyed it. I loved the story of Bleach which is often criticized by many. Ichigo wants to protect his friends and family and will do anything to do that. It was fun for me to see Ichigo find himself out of precarious situations. Soul Society is one of the greatest arc's I've ever seen in any anime. Bleach has many likeable characters, one of the problems is that there can be a lack of development. I liked almost every character in Bleach. Bleach has a plethora of unique characters. The character's are one of my favourite parts about Bleach. Bleach has amazing music, that does a VERY good job of setting the tone well. There's funny music for funny moments and very sad music for sad moments that do a good job of setting the tone and mood. The music is also very catchy and great to listen to. Especially in the Arrancar, Hueco Mundo and Fake Karakura Town arcs, a lot of Spanish kind of music (which I am listening to now!). Bleach has many good theme songs and ending songs which have a spot in my ipod. Not many complain about Bleach's music. Bleach has amazing fights, I'm not going to go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil for future watchers. Bleach's fights are very well paced and never take too long because of the fast pacing of the show. This is something that I think makes Bleach unique to many shounen animes that have fights go on for episodes on end. Bleach has long fights sometimes don't get me wrong, but the pacing for most the fights are perfect. Bleach art wise is perfect if you ask me. It's not too colourful, it's something you can take very seriously. The art for Bleach is one of the best things about the show. All in all coming to an end, Bleach wasn't perfect. It can be vastly overrated at times with fans saying it's the greatest anime/manga of all time. Bleach is one of my favourites, but I'll never claim that Bleach is better than everything. Bleach can be inconsistent and it has way too many fillers for most people's liking but what I enjoyed about Bleach was when it was canon it was pretty damn good IMO. I don't know what more to say other than I loved it. Bleach to me is a classic that I will rewatch many times. All I have to say is give it a chance once you get past the first 20 episodes it will be amazing for awhile and if you skip most the fillers you may really enjoy Bleach. (Some have said some fillers are pretty good, I wouldn't know though. I plan to watch them eventually). But yeah man, I love Bleach it helped get me back into anime and it has even taught me to protect my friends and family. I loved Ichigo as a main character. I just love Bleach and that is something no one will take away from me I don't care what anyone says. I hereby rate Bleach a 10/10 because I really enjoyed this series and to me that's all that matters whether I enjoyed it or not.",10,Recommended,"Feb 7, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6cc6c294c3,9,4810
"Bleach is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I've come across.Though the only thing that makes this anime not better than Naruto or One Piece is the plot, I think sometimes they can get repetitive, though that doesn't stop the series from having some amazing brawls. The fillers... yeah they're boring [with the exception of the new zanpakuto arc]but it doesn't stop it's popularity [too much]. The soundtrack is really good, it creates a perfect spiritual atmosphere and the characters are diverse. In my opinion, you should give it a chance.",9,Recommended,"Oct 23, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1c21ca8ac6,9,555

"Bleach is the 2nd anime I have watched. I have no standards when I watched it so I pretty much enjoyed it. But as my anime time pass by I encounter masterpieces like Hunter x Hunter, FMA:B, etc..my standards rise. From a 7/10 due to my standards rise it is now a SOLID 3/10. Story: 3/10 Starts of with a Soul Reaper giving her powers to a powerless man because he needs to save his loved ones. How original. The storyline of Bleach is one of many stereotypical anime or shounen plots. Nothiing new. Not to mention that the Arrancar Arc is just a dragged out, more plot holes and inconsistencies, and more underdeveloped characters version of Soul Society Arc. This anime also introduced us to one of the worst concepts in anime, Fullbring *insert any laughing meme*. The story in this anime is just a repetitive cycle, making it extremely predictable and uninteresting. Characters: 3/10 Wow.....There are a lot. Did they develop? NOT. Bleach, for me, has the worst main casts in any anime I have watched (even Fairy Tail's cast is better IMO). The side characters are worse. Forgettable, bland, boring, uninteresting....The villains overstay their welcome to the point of making me say ""I dont want to see you anymore! Give me Aizen!!, especially in the Arrancar Arc. They will end up losing but they will pull a Diablous Ex Machina out of there butt and ""HAHAHAHAHA i HAVE BEEN SAVING THIS TRUMP CARD!!"". Overall it is a horrible cast but Bleach still has good characters like Yamamoto, Mayuri and Byakuya.

"This anime is a great ""starter"" anime. Yes, it is part of the big three that everyone associates anime with : Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, this may change with Fairy Tail moving up the list :). Put that aside, it's still a really interesting anime. The story itself is outstanding in the beginning. An ordinary teenage boy who can see ghosts runs into, and is run through, by a shinigami who literally jumps into his life and catapults him into the turmoil and hardships of being a shinigami. Ichigo doesn't just get his powers or his upgrades if you would like to call them. He has to go through hell every single time in order to face whatever crazy psycho that is destroying either the Soul Society or Karakura town. Over time, it does get into the whole Shounen rut. Some low level bad guys swoop down, beat up the main character, he has to go on some sort of spirit quest, comes back and single handedly wipes out the whole group. But, give it a break, the anime stopped in the 400s and the manga's in the 800s last time I checked! I say, if you haven't seen it, why not?",7,Recommended,"Feb 27, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e46ebb49f0,9,1077
"I'll keep this brief. As many others have written, Bleach is a typical mainstream anime. As such it is basically a show written by formula; the formula which involves milking this cow for everything its worth. I watched the first part of the story (i would call it a season, except it took seventy something episodes to finish) it was alright the plot developed and as much as it seemed to take forever the show was enjoyable. After what little was resolved in this first adventure the show just goes on some other tangent about vampires or some such nonsense. I tried to stay interested, however I could not. The show seems to keep going for the sake of ringing its own bell. it just creates more plot tangents to make you forget about all the things that haven't been resolved, keeping you just curious enough to watch one more episode. So, chances are if you are reading this you already have seen Bleach, and probably seen more of it than i could handle, and your wondering why I'm badmouthing your favorite anime. well if you like it that's wonderful, but its not that special.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1aa80d9ca0,9,1082
"I grew up watching a lot of the original shounen anime from Dragon ball, to dragon ball Z, to yuu yuu hakusho. When I was still a little kid, I genuinely enjoyed the dragon ball manga, and the anime. At the time it was unique, fresh, and extremely popular... and it still is. Because of that I was hesitant to try out Bleach since I heard that it was a copycat of yuu yuu hakusho, and the story was predictable to the nines... As it turns out, some of the rumors I heard turned out to be true, but there were still many redeemable points to the show. Story 4/10: The story is way too predictable and way too similar to other shounen anime. The main character with unusual ability to learn and become strong unnatrually fast. Hmm, where have I seen that before?? Because it borrows so much in terms of story elements from other shounen anime, you can kinda figure out what's going to happen at the end of an arc 20 or so episodes in advance. This type of anime is the same as DBZ, and yuu yuu hakusho. The good guys always win no matter what kind of set backs the characters face. Even the ""way"" the characters become stronger is too similar to earlier shounen anime. Eccentric teachers trying to draw out the hidden power in each main character to overcome their own limits and weaknesses. The ""similarity"" issue is just one aspect... other other aspect is all kinds of annoying inconsistencies in the Bleach universe that drive me nuts. Things from unusually powerful Aizen that is so much more powerful than anyone else, it doesn't make sense; a way too convenient way of explaining all the convenient occurrences throughout the series- hou***u; inconstant aging between the soul reapers etc etc etc... Finally... some of the arcs like the bount arc and the amagai shunsuke arcs are just atrocious... and many of the fillers are basically what the writers came up with when they were high on acid. Art 7/10: Early in the show, the animation was rough at best with the characters looking quite... strange. But as the series progressed so did the art, and now it looks pretty top notch. Sound 6/10: While the BGM is sometimes pretty nice, other times it is very irritating. Who ever decided, ""If you want to see some action..."" (or number 1"" by hazel fernandes) was a good song for a shounen anime needs to be shot. It sounds like crappy, cheezy 70's disco music. It just doesn't fit at all! There is some others that is awful and it sounds like an equivalent of someone's nails on chalkboard. There were also many ending and opening songs that were really bad as well. But there were some that were really good as well, like Ranbu no melody by Cid which is running in the current season as of feb 2011. Characters 7/10: Characters are decent in Bleach. Development is slow but they are interesting...BUT some are almost copy cats of other shounen anime characters. Lets compare Ichigo and Yuusuke from yuu yuu hakusho. They both get into fights, they are both seen as yankee's in high school, they are both eventually ""recruited"" by the other world or the soul society, and they aren't exactly human. They are both head strong, caring of others, and aren't bound by rules in the slightest. They don't talk politely, they are dense, they always win eventually, and very protective of others... especially Orihime/keiko. The renji-Ichigo relationship is also quite similar to Yuusuke-Kuwabara... Over time both characters become incredibly powerful throughout the series with the help of eccentric/odd mentors. You can say that many of these traits are similar in most shounen anime like Naruto also shares similar characteristics, as well as Son Goku... But ""that"" is what sells, and that is what gets people hooked. Enjoyment 7/10: Most of the enjoyment comes from some kind of ""addiction"" factor where you just have to see the next episode even though you know what's going to happen. Bleach does that VERY well, and it will keep you hooked, wanting to watch more until there isn't any left to watch. Same kinda formula that other very popular shounen anime used. Overall 6/10: It's not the best shounen anime, it's not very original, and it's quite predictable... but in the end you'll in the least enjoy the many action sequences, and the progression of the characters throughout the anime.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 6, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1f16cd01c9,9,4294

"hero meets new enemy -> enemy is too strong -> seems like hero will lose -> something happens -> hero gets more powerfull -> hero beats enemy -> go back to step one. take that, add tons of fan service and stretch it across 300 episodes and you've got Bleach. on a more serious note: I really enjoyed bleach at first. it is quite faithfull to the manga so that is always a plus. the plot is actually quite interesting and the fight scenes are great and intense. alot better than Naruto IMO. but just like Naruto, the producers became greedy and they have stretched the story far too much. after watching literally hundreds of episodes and reading the manga, this show gets painfully repetetive and the plot takes extreamly long to thicken. basically its a great show that turned into garbage for being prolonged too much.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_031d847339,9,820
"Story: Bleach isn't really the type of anime that has to have deep, compliacted, mind bottling plot. It's not really the reason why I got drawn to watching and kept on watching it in the first place. For me the story of bleach is good as it is cause the only thing I watch bleach for is the action, cool art style, and awsome powers. Bleach is a pure ""Action Anime"". Though it doesn't have a complex plot to it. There's still alot of memorable moments in Bleach that i really loved. Art: It's also the other thing why I was drawn to bleach. It's Art style looks unique and epic that I hooked to bleach because of it. There's no other anime like it. Sound: The music in bleach is pretty awsome. The Ops and EDs are cool and suits the anime well. With awsome BGM that suits the mood of the episode pretty well. Enjoyment: I really enjoyed Bleach alot and I feel like I could watch the series over and over again and look back on how it all began and shit... etc :D Overall: For me.. Bleach is the best Action Anime I have ever seen. Nothing can top it in the genre of action.. To those of you who are just starting to watch bleach.. it's not really an anime with a mind bottling story cause bleach isn't really about that. The Fights, Powerups and the Moments is what bleach is really about. :D",10,Recommended,"Oct 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a472a00aa7,9,1292
"Many people get caught up with the simpler aspects of Bleach and can't appreciate it for what it really is. You will often hear that it's all about the fight scenes, the enemies, the story arcs, or the evolution of the main character powering up, and thats its all the same. While those things are all part of the anime and frequently recurring themes, they are not the main driving force of the series. Bleach is a Character Development show, plain and simple. Everything else that happens is just there to provide filler, and an environment where the characters can be introduced and interact to gradually reveal their personalities, powers, traits and history. It's all about providing just enough to get you interested and wanting to see more. There are many small events or seemingly inconsequential occurences that can correlate hundreds of episodes later. In this regard, it is absolutely essential to rewatch Bleach at least once. For the new viewer, the sheer number of main and supporting characters can be overwhelming. To be honest for awhile it kind of turned me off until I really began to get what it was all about. It's also important to understand that while Ichigo is the main character, he's moreso there just to provide a common ground upon which all the different aspects of the show converge. He is not an overpowering lead or the centre of everything, and doesn't really have a particularly interesing personality. The attraction of Ichigo lies in the what and why and how, and the way he is percieved by others. The character art is fantastic - each character's personality is very accurately represented in their appearance. Nearly every character is interesting and has a lot of deep history, unanswered questions and mystery, many of which are so far left to the viewers imagination. Don't expect the same level of depth from the enemies, as they inevitibly all die. While nearly all of the Bleach Intro and End credits are absolute rubbish, the soundtracks are nothing short of masterpieces. Without a doubt, Bleach has the best and most fitting music of any long running anime series. A couple of the arcs aren't fantastic story-wise, and like any show it has its ups and downs so its important just to stick with it. Look away for a moment, and you can miss important clues and info. The second time around, things can make a lot more sense and suddenly seem a lot more interesting. Unfortunately I hate to admit that the first time I watched Bleach I was still a dub watching fanboy noob. Bleach changed all that, and rewatching the first 200 eps in Japanese was the best thing I could have done. The actual proper voice actors have a huge impact on overall watchability, and are amazingly fitting for each character. If you watch this show dubbed, you are losing a lot right there, so if you are going to bother watching Bleach i suggest doing it right and going subs. I've never watched dubs since, and in fact Bleach turned me into a hardline anti-dub viewer. As 'generic' and mainstream as Bleach's reputation can sometimes be, it is still probably one of, if not my favourite anime just for the complexity and depth of characters. Sadly i think a lot of people who watch Bleach just dont get it, id suspect mostly younger viewers. It's important to realise this isn't just some shallow kids crap like Dragon Ball Z. When the series was cancelled I was absolutely devastated since after 366 episodes there is still so much with regards to many characters not yet even touched on. I'm hoping that this is just a way to move past Ichigo as the main character, and a 'spin-off' is in the works.

"Bleach. One of the best animes i have seen so far. I watched all Episodes and i still want more. So overall Bleach is a typically ""boy saves world"" anime, BUT: Every caracter (including the side caracters) got their own story in what they believe, what they are fighting for and what had to pass through in their lives. You can realy understand the caracters and feel good/bad for them. The story itself is pretty long and you are so excided to see the final battle with ichigo vs. ...... The ""bad"" thing about the length of the anime is it has very much filler episodes. At the beginning of the first filler chapter i thought ""nah, i want to see the story again"" but if i watched more i didn't realy care if it was a filler ep or not. At every side story you learn more about the caracters and the filler stories are also very interesting. I spread the anime into 2 parts: 1. The Fighting scense: Realy cool fighting scenes where they go all out and destroy everything. I've never seen a anime where the fights are so genious. In other animes you think ""ah they are fighting"" but in Bleach you are totally into it and you don't know who wins. Ichigo learns more and more about his abillities in the fights and i was amazed every time he got all out and fought like there is no tomorrow. 2. The ""normal"" live part: You can see the caracers in their normal live, going to school, eating dinner with the family or meeting friends. These parts are very funny and it really hits my humor. The caracters provoke each other in such funny ways. Also there are some echi parts but nor too often. Alltogether its totally worth watching it. I love this anime and i want more of it.

Though it' not without its faults, of course there are the fillers and the draw out of the fights which annoy me but it still is amazing.

The first arc was written very well. Emotional, suspense, dramatic, awesome revelation, epic fight scene. I can't bring my words of the awesomeness of this show. Then, the main enemy appear. As far as I know, the enemy in this series is just one. The others are just his pawns. Then, the second arc begun. That's where the downfall begin. Too many characters, over-repeat fights and random power ups, too many plot holes, predictable outcome and a strong villain character died so pathetically killed by their own boss. Some of the characters died so quickly like they are bunch of fodder. But, the fallen of the main villain was the best of this series. Anyway, great art and animation. Best anime soundtrack I've ever heard. Character development is not that good. Only a few characters got developed but they have quite good flashback. What I enjoy the most in this series is not the plot, but the fight scenes. It can rival DBZ and beat Naruto and One Piece. Yeah, I said that.

"Have you ever seen an arguement between a Call of Duty fan and a Battlefield fan? The Call of Duty fan will always argue that ""graphics do not make the game"". Similarly in animes people will argue that the technical department comes second. WRONG! I'm not saying that graphics and sound are everything, but I am saying that each anime has its own highlights. And in Bleach's case, the technical superiority is so strong that even major flows like a gazillion plotholes or one of the worst senses of humor to ever exist in anime just don't matter. Remember Avatar? The movie was basically crap but it did so well on the technical part that you could easily forget the plot was basically white guy meets noble culture. For the basics: The anime's main theme is basically ghosts vs demons. Specifically samurai-like ghosts (shinigami) vs black masses with white masks on (hollows). Traitors appear on the side of the shinigamis and they side with an army of hollows so that their leader can become king of the spiritual world. Just to give an example of Bleach's plotholes... It was never actually explained WHY the traitor becoming king would be a bad thing. Granted it was a Coup De Tat but bringing peace between the shinigamis and the hollows isn't exactly a bad thing is it? The show pushes him as evil when really he never actually attacked anyone without being provoked (except for some kids in the end of the arc but really, who gives a ""$%^?). Anyway that aside the show's humor is TERRIBLE, which apparently the animators realised too at some point early on and completely cat off. The story is usually dark and the mangaka isn't afraid of axing off people. It should also be noted that half of the episodes are actually fillers. That said bleach actually follows filler arcs rather than Naruto's moronic off-and-on the main story switches. In addition, with the exception of the first filler arc (which wasn't all that bad either really) the filler arcs in bleach are actually good and they continuously get better, with the last filler arc being in fact as good as the main story if not better. In fact everything in Bleach improved as the episodes went on. Unlike some other animes (regarding pirates, ""cough"") Bleach matured with time, starting off as good and ending as a masterpiece. Now for the real deal: Technically Bleach is what the Dota announcer would call ""beyond godlike"". The visuals gradually improved (at the start of the anime they were awful truth be told). At the final arcs practically 3/4 of each episode's frames could easily be used as wallpapers, with amazing detail aesthetics (to clarify, the resolution isn't ALL that high but the guys at the shading and art department just knew what they were doing). The soundtrack also matured as time went on. While at the start of the anime it was impressive and by far the best soundtrack that had appeared in animation at the time, in the final arcs Bleach simply had one of the best ost collections to ever appear in media in general. ""Perfect"" is hardly enough to describe the music, which was excellantly used by the animators. Also important are the character designs, all of which are memorable and generally cool-looking, even for the most minor of characters. Hell, the character design of the most basic of hollows (which are basically there to die) is actually really intimidating. Character designs, moves transformations etc etc are all really well made, making it extremely hard to find a ""favourite"" among them. To focus more on the music part: In most animes the animators first make the video clip and THEN decide what music to add on top of it, cutting the songs so that they fit. In Bleach the animators actually did the opposite. First it was decided which soundtrack would be used in each scene of the manga (in fact I suspect that Kubo himself WROTE the manga with specific soundtracks in mind for each scene as time went on) and then the animation was made based on it. In the final arcs you will often notice that the screen remains a second or so longer than needed on the same image. That is done so that the next clip can start at the same time the ost's next beat starts (for example see ichigo's battle with tsukishima in episode 359, it's the one where I first noticed this detail, but it was actually being done for quite some time already). As a result of this the choreography of bleach is hands down AMAZING. Also as a result of this every battle, regardless of how small or trivial, or even of its participants, ends up being 100% memorable and pumping up. In other animes you will basically remember 2-3 scenes, the ones where the protagonist battles the big villain etc because of all the hype for the battle that the anime had busied itself creating. In bleach though most scenes will include a soundtrack that good that you will remember them without a problem (along with the soundtrack that was playing at the time). Bleach's osts range from extremely sad memorable themes (for example Torn Apart), to memorable techno-metal beats (BL 57 Sakkaku being a good example) and to memorable choirs (Treachery, Stand Up be Strong, etc etc). Pay attention to the word ""memorable"". Bleach might have a loooot of problems but in the end it does so incredibly well on the technical part that they are all easily ignorable. For those that HAVEN'T watched Bleach yet, I do suggest watching just the final arc (eps 343-366) to learn what technical perfection means (no need to have seen the previous episodes, you'll soon understand what's going on easily).",10,Recommended,"Sep 4, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6f4a9aee27,10,5559
"Ok so this might be a very bias review because Bleach is the best anime i have ever watched. The filler is ok but as to the main story line it is easily my favorite story that i have ever come in contact with. Tite Kubo is a genius for thinking up this story from thin air and to keep it as interesting as it is for so long. The Soul Socitey arc really caught my attention and i couldnt stop watching it from there. If it werent for so many filler arcs i would give this anime a 10/10 without a doubt. I have watched this anime twice through and i love it the same both times. The storyline of a human becoming a soul reaper and becoming one of the strongest in the squads really appeals to me. I love bad ass anime characters. The ones that are super strong and you watch become super strong over time. This is what happens with my favorite character of all time Ichigo Kurosaki. There are many turns that you dont see coming if you dont look into the spoilers. I have recommended this many times to my friends and they love it too. I also read the manga of this so i dont really want to spoil such an amazing story for you. the amount of villians that i like in this is unbelivable. i love villains in anime they are like my favorite parts about an anime. If the series doesnt have a villian that i like then i sometimes end up dropping the anime becuase i get so bored of it. In bleach there are 3 villians that i will always remember for as long as i live. Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, and Aizen. If they continue this anime i would be so happy that i might die. lol The new arc that is supposibly the final arc in the manga is happening at the moment and boy is it good. So for all of you wanting to watch an incredible supernatural story where you watch a kid from a small town turn into a bad ass shinigami i would recommend this 100% lol",9,Recommended,"Jul 21, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_128a0fca13,10,1837

"Ok well Bleach, is a very popular anime. None the less one that i really enjoy. Theres a lot of problems with it though. The filler is the worst ive seen. Oh god the bount ark. The rest of the stories are pretty good, its the filler that gets me down in most of these though. Its like story wouldve been a 9 without filler, enjoyment wouldve been a 9 too. So really it brought down a lot. The zombatos are cool, the characters are outsanding. The sounds pretty good. Along with the dub is good too. So really skip filler, and you might be bored, when they drag on fights. Well i guess its an 8. Warning: During fillers they also dont care about the art as well. So the fillers ultra worse, cause the art sucks along with it being horrible.",8,Recommended,"Nov 6, 2008",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_66883deff5,10,739
"Bleach is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I’ve come across. Of course, with all the time it gets for character and plot development by being a long-running anime, it’s a good run almost no matter what your preferences are. I rate this anime 5, not because it’s the most awesome anime I’ve ever seen(Gurren Lagann takes that spot) nor does it have a plot that keeps me sitting in constant expectation(Death Note does that better), but because not only does it give you plenty of time to get to love it, when the big plot twists do come they come from out of nowhere, even with all the - very effective - foreshadowing throughout the series. Another thing that keeps you interested is of course what each character will do and, perhaps most of all, what their powers are. Each shinigami wields a zanpakuto(lit. ""soul-cutter sword"") which is both a weapon and a partner. Seeing the ""released"" power of a new zanpakuto is always interesting, even later in the series. Lastly, I would like to talk about filler. As most of you know, filler is bad. As considerably fewer of you know, filler is at times a necessary evil. For your own sakes, I highly recommend that you do not take the first filler arc(Bounto) too seriously. It leaves you with 3 new characters(that are non-canon and thus mostly appear in later fillers) but other than that it has no real impact on the plot. Still, a few nice fights, although animation is kinda poor. The second filler arc(Amagai) is way different, and(this is another reason for those 5 stars) does not IN ANY WAY impact the main story, as it doesn’t pretend to be part of the storyline, and instead ""sometime else"" with no affiliation as to what is currently happening in the real story. It’s also much more well animated(you’ll find that Bleach improves its animation greatly over the course of the show) and the story is actually quite good. The Zanpakuto Unknown Tales filler arc has just begun, but it looks awesome ^^ So if you haven’t watched Bleach, or got tired of it after 2-3 eps, take my word for it and try it out for the first 25 at least. There’s always fast-forward^^ Sincerely, renji59",10,Recommended,"Jun 8, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_669843f473,10,2147
"Bleach is a very well made anime, it has decent character development and has a overall good storyline.The animations are of a typical anime series.The animations in the beginning have a more manga style to them but later on it changes, During fillers the animations seem stiff. except for the last one. Also towards end the animations seem a bit half a**.There is also alot of censorship on some of the more bloody scenes. The OST is excellent and the openings and endings are great. The character design is great and the show has alot of character diversity in race and personality, for example they have Mexican,Japanese (of course),African American,and German characters. Each faction represents a culture. All of these are the reasons for why i watched and enjoyed this anime. Besides the excessive filler its a great anime and i would highly recommend it to any person who loves sword fighting and supernatural anime.",8,Recommended,"Apr 12, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3a9bb14bb7,10,923
"I have a serious love/hate relationship with Bleach. While the overall story and battle scenes are usually pretty intense and rewarding, they are too few and far between. In order to get to the meat of the anime, you are forced to wade through hours of boring dialogue and lame slice-of-life episodes that seem way out of place. While I (somewhat) appreciate Bleach's attention to explaining how the characters' powers work, it is overdone to the point where battles lose all significance and weight due to the bland and lengthy explanations. Bleach's biggest problem is the fact that it tries to take 10 episodes worth of a story arc and draw it out until it's around 30-40 episodes, which makes the story for each arc seem slow and repetitive. I think you would be surprised by how much of this show is just filler. For a 25 minute show, approximately 8 minutes of it is spent with the opening, recap and ending (Thats almost a THIRD of each episode). Then once you get to the actual show, you get to see one or two cool attacks before the characters go into lengthy dialogue describing their special abilities, their reasons for fighting, etc., etc. All in all, I can't say I would recommend this anime. While the fights are sometimes pretty cool and the story has a few redeeming qualities, the show is far too slow and repetitive to be worth watching all the way through.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 23, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_19c37b430b,10,1376
"So, Bleach is a very over rated anime, people either really love it or really hate it. I personally really love it, but that's probably because it's the first anime I watched, so it does hold a special place in my heart. Story- 8: I love the story, it's well developed and has a lot of backstory to it. What made it less good... THE FILLER! They needed to calm down. Step back. Wait for more of the manga to be published, not add a filler every few episodes. Art- 8: The art was nice but nothing special, until it came to fight scenes. When there was fights the art was really pretty *cough* senbonzakura kageyoshi *cough* Sound- 9: The music fits so well and just makes fights really intense and yeah, bleach has some of the best anime music I've heard. Character: 8- Some just need more air time, like c'mon if they're going to make 366 episodes with a tonne of filler can they not make some of that filler useful?

"Bleach, the story of the Orange haired high school Shinigami, used to be my favorite anime and is still an enjoyable part of my week. If you are looking for a life changing deep and meaningful story, look elsewhere. Bleach is a fast paced action comedy with one of the biggest casts of characters I've ever seen. Not the best anime I've ever seen (which I will explain further) but definitely worth a watch... at least for a while. Story: 7/10 If this show had stopped after the Soul Society ark I would have rated the plot as a 9 or 10, but after that the plot has only gone downhill. The begining of the series did a god job of balancing humor and action while explaining the way Bleach's world works, as well as introducing a HUGE cast of characters in a way that was fun and engading. All the way through the Soul Society ark it was felt like Kudo Tite had a clear plan for where his story was going, the problem is that by the time he got there the series popularity was at it's peek and he was left scrambling for ideas, drawing the series out with constant battles with flat uninteresting characters while he tries to figure out what the hell to do with the runaway train that is Bleach. That's not even taking into acount the nessicary evil to any long series, filler. The current ark is still watchable, but not up to the standard of the earlier plot ark. Art: 7/10 When Bleach's art is good, it's fantastic. One thing I love about Kubo's work is that as the series went on and his style evolved, everyone got ridiculously hot. My God some of the art is downright droolworthly at times! Unfortunately when Bleach's art is bad, it's horrible. The beginning of the series was so over contrasted I don't quite know what they were thinking, but fortunately they tone it down as time goes on. Some of the filler ark's animation is clearly sub par and dissapointing compared to the quality expected by the time the series gets that far. Overall the artwork inconsistant, but fair. Sound: 9/10 The 9 is for the original Japanese dub, we'll get to the English in a moment. I enjoy pretty much all the Seiyuu (Paku Romi!!!) and can't think of any complaints I have about it. The music is fun and oddly appropriate. ""Number One"" which often plays in Ichigo's moments of triumph cracks me up, just awesome. I also enjoy the fact that more Spanish sounding music is worked in as the Arrancar are introduced. As for the English dub, first note that I am by no means a dub hater, but I must say that Bleach is one of the more dissapointing dubs out there for me. I have never been a huge fan of Viz, and this series did nothing to endear me to them. With a cast so huge, there are bound to be people I like, such as Ichigo (done by Johnny Yong Bosch) who sounds incredibly appropriate. Hanataro, Orihime, Mayuri, Urahara and (oddly enough) Gin are also some of my English dub favorites. On the other hand I absolutely cannot stand Renji, Byakuya, Ishida, Shunsui, Kira, Hitsugaya and Matsumoto to name a few. Add on top of that the horrendous pronunciation of half the names and places and it's enough to make me want to pull my hair out. To someone who has never seen the Japanese it's probably quite palatable, but I have been spoiled. Characters: 10/10 I'd say this is/was Bleach's strong suit. There is such a fun, fascinating and massive cast of characters that there's sure to be someone you'll like. I tend to only really latch onto an anime (or any story) if I care about the supporting characters, of which Bleach has no shortage. The only downside to such a large cast is that if your favorite is anyone other than Ichigo, chances are you won't see them all that often, and only after other side characters have had their time in the sun as well. Luckily so many of the characters are interesting and unique that no matter who pops up it's typically not dissapointing. As the series goes on the characters seem to have less of a personality (the Arrancar are prime examples), but are still often pretty, and usually entertaining in some way. The great characters in Bleach is probably the main thing that keeps me watching. Enjoyment: 7/10 Though the plot evenually becomes an endless stream of fighting with little point, that's really what Shounen is all about I suppose, and the fights are fairly well done at least. The humor is good (even the filler stuff is mostly acceptable) and the general mood is pretty fun. Overall: 7/10 I would absolutely recommend this series to anyone through the Soul Society ark, then tell them to not bother with the rest and let it end on a good note. But if your anything like me, by the time the Soul Society ark is over you want MORE, because this show and it's characters is Goddamn catchy and addictive. So even if you can't pull away when it's peek has passed, you will still likely enjoy the ride as you go down with the ship. When looking for a Shounen anime to pass the time, you really can't go wrong with Bleach.",7,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7c477fc467,10,4964
"Firstly, I have to say its not easy to rate an anime like bleach, an anime which has a few arcs are very like to have one or two arcs which aren't very good. The storyline for bleach was at its best at the first Arc where ichigo has to save rukia .This is where the story was far more complicated and unpredictable compared to the later arcs. The storyline in the later arcs is just beat up bad guys. A major weakness in the anime is the fillers, fillers generally generate a lot of hate among the anime fans. For one, ichigo's bankai . One of the best scenes for bleach was when he first used his bankai againt kuchiki byakuya , during the fight ichigo looked so strong . However when he used bankai in the fillers in the later episodes he looked so silly and weak. In the fillers, he was never consistent, this is a very bad downside. The art for bleach was actually very good for its time of production. However, the fillers spoiled much of it . the art for some of the fillers were horribly made. But overall id say the art for bleach is fairly good. Sound, the sound for bleach really gets you into the mood when u first hear it especially those boss fight scenes. The character for bleach was very good in the beginning, especially in the first arc. His last progress for me was when he fought ulquiorra on top of the hollow dome. When he unleashed his full hollow powers, and then later on unleashing getsuga. But the progress from his bankai to his later powers are very slow and bad. I felt that ichigo should have learn some kidou (magic) . And make the fight scenes more tactical . So the fight scenes will become more intelligent rather than just beating the enemy time after time. I really enjoyed the first arc of bleach. It was the best. The later arcs was not so bad. One of the most recent arc with Ginjo in it left a distaste in my mouth. In my opinion, they should have ended it when Aizen got beaten by ichigo after he used getsuga. The biggest weakness for bleach was the fillers and the lack of abilities and the ginjo arc, if they had managed this factors, I would have given bleach a much better review probably scoring a 9. I believe bleach is overrated because of the reviews given by new anime viewers. Those new anime viewers are probably inexperienced and would compare their anime to cartoons rather than anime to anime overall in that genre. Overall, Bleach was one of my favourite anime's but I would only give it a 5.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 20, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2d1fb77805,10,2450
"Are you looking for an anime filled with adrenaline? If you want to embark yourself on an extraordinary adventure, you are definitely in the right place. Bleach is the type of anime that will make you go from feeling every single emotion like you've never felt them before to leave your heart aching from one moment to another. It's hard to make every single character lovable but in Bleach everything is possible. You will find yourself in a constant inner battle, trying to decipher which character is the best but let me tell you, you will be wasting your time because there will always going to be better ones about to introduce themselves. There's a lot of dissatisfaction because of the amount of fillers in this anime but I don't really get how that can downgrade an entire anime. It's simple as if you don't want to watch the fillers then search for them and skip them. Basing your opinion merely on that fact and continuously comparing it to the other big animes is what kills the enjoyment of watching something. If you want to start watching Bleach, don't do it thinking in One Piece or Naruto, each one of them is different in their own way and that doesn't necessarily make them worse or better. Of course there are some flaws but just like life itself, Bleach teaches us that nothing can be perfect yet even in those times we need to keep on walking and appreciate what we have. It teaches us that friendship and family is what keeps us alive, what gives us the power to fight whatever comes next. Strength is not only found in the way you fight but in the way your heart functions. Strength is shown in different forms because everybody has their own strength.",10,Recommended,"May 18, 2025",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d5f9a69473,10,1675
"Ah, where do I even begin with this festering pile of excrement called ""Bleach""? The truth is I really wanted to like bleach, I had heard lots from my friends and expected great things from one of the most influential shonen of all time. Instead, Bleach turns out to be an abomination to the art of storytelling, a disgrace to the anime medium, and an insult to anyone with an iota of intelligence (in my very cool and honest opinion, that is not written as a rant nor as an appeal to first time viewers for them to not watch bleach due to my review tehe~). PLOT (2/10) Let's start with its nonsensical plot that jumps around like a deranged kangaroo on crack. Seriously, Kubo Tite must have been snorting lines of pure insanity when he penned this garbage. Arcs in Bleach appear to materialize and dissipate seemingly at random, populated by forgettable villains who fail to leave a lasting impression (save for a scant few). This haphazard storytelling concocts a snooze-inducing spectacle that had me more preoccupied with adjusting my orbs with a few scratches than actually paying attention to the screen. (And let's be clear, such is an obvious jest, as my penchant for critiquing anime far outweighs any hypothetical affinity for groin-based activities.) But wait, there's more!! Bleach's most beloved power system, which I think is related enough to the plot for me to not make a new category for it. The labyrinthine labyrinth of Bleach's power system, or should I say, the labyrinthine labyrinth of convoluted absurdities, mess of ass-pulls, divine interventions and deus ex machinas that Kubo conjured from the depths of his fevered nightmares. Bankai, Shikai, Quincy, Hollows—what the hell is this nonsense? It's like Kubo threw every random idea he had into a blender and hit the ""puree"" button. I just can't get behind it. CHARACTERS (1/10) The characters? Don't even get me started on those cardboard cutouts with delusions of depth. Ichigo, the brooding protagonist with the personality of a wet sponge, is about as compelling as watching paint dry. All that unfolds, to possibly the worst character I have ever read, is that he was super chosen to be all the cool races so he could have all the cool powers and, sometimes, occasionally, he'll belt out a rallying cry about friendship or some other sort of such drivel. If one was looking for protagonists akin to the one found in 'Solo Levelling,' then Bleach might be exactly what one is looking for but for me, it's a resounding disappointment. And yet, could it be any more mind-numbingly boring? Oh, most definitely... it probably could. Enter the sprawling ensemble cast of Bleach—a motley crew of characters who, aside from occasionally showcasing flashy attacks, serve mainly as fodder for the narrative's erratic whims. Get ready for a rollercoaster ride as you ping-pong between various characters engaging in skirmishes with supposedly 'important' side villains, each encounter more underwhelming than the last. And don't even get me started on Orihime, the epitome of uselessness and vapidness. This walking pair of tits serves no purpose other than to scream ""Ichigo-kunnnnn~~~"" like a brain-dead parrot on repeat, I could not stop banging my head on the wall whenever she was on scream and I imagine I would not be alone in this sentiment. Seriously, her entire character seemingly consists of being purposefully useless, it's pathetic, nauseating, and a disgrace to female characters everywhere. Rukia, for example, may have her flaws, but at least she has some semblance of depth compared to this vacuous waste of ink and pixels. ANIMATION (3/10) The animation quality. Studio Pierrot must have outsourced their animation to a bunch of drunken monkeys with Parkinson's disease. The fight scenes are about as fluid as a constipated elephant trying to tap dance. Nothing much for me to say, it wasn't very good, but it didn't feel like enough to be very mediocre either. SOUNDTRACK (6/10) It's alright. Good songs here and there, nothing special. In the end, maybe it is special, as it is easily the only good part of Bleach. OVERALL (1/10) Despite all its glaring flaws, there are still droves of people who worship at the altar of ""Bleach."" This same, clueless, people probably think ""Naruto"" is high literature. Bleach was likely their first foray into anime, and they cling to it like a security blanket, terrified to venture beyond its putrid confines... Terrified of seeing anime as actual interesting art and compelling narratives. I simply can't get it, and I probably never will. In conclusion, Bleach is a steaming pile of hot garbage masquerading as entertainment. If you have even an ounce of taste or dignity, steer clear of this dumpster fire and find something worthy of your time, otherwise be prepared to feel like sticking your head in a blender and hitting the ""puree"" button. Surprisingly, I think even that would've been a more productive use of my time than watching Bleach.",1,Not Recommended,"Apr 2, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e6704dcc18,10,4976

"An anime that was really iconic during its time; It was produced during the early 2000s and it was a quintessential A-tier closely up there with the likes of Naruto, One Piece, DBZ and such during its height. Although there are some factors that really stained its ratings for me and I'd discuss it in this review. Nonetheless if you got time to kill, I don't mind recommending it. Animation (7.5/10) - It has a trademark that was nice for its era, also throughout the entire 366 episodes you would see its animation quality slightly evolve which was an indication that its producers actively spent some time and money during its run. Although on some fights it feels like they are reusing frames which was a common thing for older, action-based animes. Nonetheless, I do not think it'd hurt your viewing experience in any major way. Storyline (5/10) - Do not get me wrong, its major arcs were great and entertaining. But the way this anime pumps out its filler episodes is through arcs and you'd have to mostly sit through 15-30 episodes of nothing but canon stories which is agonizing. Also, its pacing in general is a little slow. Probably because they are trying to maximize their television runtime then but still, I personally think its these two factors that really held the show back for what its worth. Could've had a higher score, seriously. Soundtrack (8/10) - Its music library and sound engineering was good! I personally liked it. They have a flexible selection of music ranging from rock, ballad, J-Pop and such that they chose for their intros and extros, and all the sounds and ambience effects they utilized were really atmospheric and distinct.

"I first started watching Bleach when I was around 9 years old. The storyline started off great, with the Soul Society arc, and the foreshadowing was amazing when Aizen was allegedly found dead. The many characters in Bleach really brought out Kubo's amazing work. I mean, all the characters had different yet similar personalities and traits, such as Ikkaku Madarame and Kenpachi Zaraki who both loved to fight but were different in the way they fight, as Zaraki refused to use the help of his Zanpakuto and Ikkaku used his, even to the extent of a Bankai. There were many rivalries and competitions, such as Renji wanting to defeat his Captain Byakuya Kuchiki, and how Ichigo and Renji competed with each other. I would say that the best thing about Bleach would be the music/soundtrack. For example, the fighting soundtracks in the battles between enemies was awesome. Notable ones are B13A, Stand Up Be Strong, and many more. Objectively, this was and always will be my ALL-TIME favorite anime, no matter what happens in the future.

"Bleach is excellent despite having quite a few flaws. For example, there are a lot of fillers that go in all directions and are generally not very interesting. Despite this, it didn't stop me from loving Bleach because these flaws don't bother me, and other qualities make up for them. Starting with Ichigo and Orihime Inoue. For Ichigo: He is the most endearing and badass character in the anime, in my opinion. However, the path to being badass is difficult for him. At the beginning of the anime, Ichigo leads a completely ordinary high school life until the day Rukia comes to protect him from a Hollow that came to devour his family's souls. Having been injured because of him, Ichigo agrees to become a Shinigami himself to save her. He has always been different from others, not only because of his naturally orange hair but also because he can see ghosts. With a rather dark, direct, and even rough character, Ichigo is very protective of his friends and family. However, his ability to see ghosts and the need to hide it make him quite reserved. As the story progresses, his reserved nature gradually disappears, and he goes from being an enemy of the Soul Society to a recognized and respected Substitute Shinigami. His power earns him the respect of most Shinigami. He is certainly one of the nakama I would like to have. And Orihime: Unfortunately, she is the most criticized and one of the least appreciated characters in the anime. She is reproached for being ""useless in combat, whiny, silly, pure fan service, and for not evolving."" I think these comments are extremely harsh! Besides, I didn't find her that sexualized despite her large breasts. Maybe it's because Orihime attracts all the attention with often ridiculous sequences. However, it's a shame to limit oneself to that because she makes progress over the episodes in using her ""Six Flowers of Shun Shun"" power. Through courage and selflessness, she has become a formidable fighter! With her kindness, Orihime is very adorable! The other main characters are generally charismatic and endearing despite the number of characters in the anime. There is little fan service, which makes it enjoyable to watch. There are only two characters with large breasts: Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto.",10,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bca0f871c1,11,2262
"This is my first review on MAL. Being aware of the fact that Bleach is not the best anime, it is my favourite one. I will try to be as honest as possible. Story: 7/10 From my point of view, the weakest point of this anime. Even though the story is good, if you compare it with One Piece or Naruto, it is not that good. The main problem is that the two main arcs are based on the rescue of a secondary character, there is no a deeper reason behind. Anyway, both Soul Society and Arrancar arcs are great with decent plots. Art: 9/10 Taking into account that Bleach was a weekly anime, the animators put a great effort on it. The design of the characters is fantastic, the fights and openings are animated amazingly and, with some exceptions, the whole anime has a pretty good animation. I am particulary impressed with the animation of the second half of the Arrancar arc. Sound: 10/10 With no doubts, the best of Bleach. Nobody can deny that Bleach's OST is magnificent, so many epic soundtracks that suit with the epic fights, sad songs that suit with sad moments. From my point of view, one of the best OST of all anime, having 3 or 4 of the most epic songs in anime. Besides, most of the opening' songs are also fantastic, such OP 2,12 and 13. Character: 8/10. There are two parts here. On one hand, the main character has not a great development throughout the story. I especially miss that lack of development , i am not going to lie. Besides, the ""main"" secondary characters do not also experience it, being forgotten in many cases. On the other hand, i must say i am in love with almost all the captains of Gotei 13 and Espadas, along with Aizen and Urahara. Many of these characters, like Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ulquiorra... are undoubtedly iconic, which makes Bleach have plenty of epic and likeable characters. Enjoyment: 9/10. I must confess that, at the beginning, i did not like Bleach that much. The first 20 episodes were ok, but it had nothing special which made me love it. However, as new characters were appearing (the captains, Aizen, etc.) i was enjoying it more and more. But it was not until the appearence of Espadas that i completely fell in love with this anime, up to the point that i was not able to stop watching it, enjoying every single episode. Perhaps it is the kind of anime that suits the most with my liking, but being honest i enjoyed it a lot. Overall: 9/10 Some of you may agree, and some of you may not agree, but if you are interested in shonen animes and you want to give a try to 300 episodes, i strongly recommend watching Bleach, my favourite anime.",9,Recommended,"Apr 15, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0300b91a2a,11,2589
"Bleach is my favorite Piece of media . I didnt grow up with it and watched plenty other shows before it, namly Naruto, Deathnote and Code Geass for example. However Bleach was the first time a show really gave me this feeling of watching something that is made for me. It resonates with me a lot more than i thought a piece of fiction could. Story: For a Shounen, i think Bleachs story is far greater than People would give it credit for. Afterarll you got the entire framework of Urahara and Aizen playing 3D-Chess with everyone, Ichigos power and everything regarding his own inner conflict, himself rejecting his (Hollow)powers , the Way Aizen outplays SoulSociety, the story unfolds and the characters and their battles actually have meaningful conclusions without using the common anime troupes such as Narutos sweettalking the villain is just satisfying. For example , Ichigo vs Byakuya. This is a conflict between Ichigo and him basically declining the entirety of Soul Societys (outdated) rules and Byakuya who wants to uphold those rules. However trough the fight and the few lines they share in that fight Byakuya finally ""loses "" , aka he accepts his mindset was wrong, Ichigo literally doesnt tell him "" i understand you "" or "" we are similiar "", instead he tells him, "" i still dont get it , if i was in your position i still would have acted differently "" There is many moments like this , but this is what i wanted to highlight. Art: For the time Bleach looks fantastic, compared to modern Standards maybe not so much, but i actually think it aged quite well and still has good animation and a beatiful art style, the manga however is better in that department. There is so many iconic Shots and scenes in Bleach, so many beatiful abilities and Moments. Sound: Bleach has by far the best OSTs ive ever heard in any media. Undeniably. Shiro Sagisu is just a mastermind, and he went all out for Bleach. ""Precipe of Defeat"" ""Number One"" ""Stand up be Strong"", pretty much all Openings and the spanish soundtracks to just name a few . There is a lot more tho. Characters: This gotta be the best thing about this show. Not only my favorite character / protagonist of all time in Ichigo, but also my favorite Villain with Aizen. Half of the captains are just Top Tier characters , if not more. Kenpachi, Byakuya, Toshiro, Yamamoto, Shunsui, Ukitake, Mayuri, there is to many to count. All of them are unique , somehow even tho they all wear a black uniform with a white haori they still have some of the most unique design in all of anime ( literally all of them as well) . The Vice Captains are also just amazing. Renji, Ikkaku, Rangiku and many more. Outside of these we got one of the best Dads in anime , akka Ishin, we got Urahara , my favorite teacher in anime and two candidates for ""Best girl"" with Yoruichi and Rukia ( not that there arent more) . Villains like Ulqiorra and Grimmjow werent even needed with how amazing Aizen is , but they still are there. I know no show that has such a big cast , and manages to develop so many of them, make so many of them this memorable. Especially considering that BLeach actually only has around 180 canon episodes, this is impressive, and ofc the last Arc will increase this even more. Enjoyment: There is not a single show that will ever reach the levels of hype and enjoyment for me , that Bleach delivered. Ichigo has to many badass moments to count, i get chills on all his transformations. The fights are just the best in anime, namely Ulqiorra vs Ichigo would be my favorite. The chills when Aizen outsmarts everyone, when he literally wipes a bunch of captains.. nothing has ever reached this same hype to me. The OSTs, beatiful visuals , the fun cast and amazing setting , the mysteryious atmosphere (Especially in the first arcs) and so much more contribute a lot to this. Conclusion: Bleach is the best show i have ever watched and i stand by this opinion for years. There was a single time a show gave me similiar feelings with "" Steins Gate"" . But really this show may not be for everyone, but it certainly is for me. Its honestly just everything i want from a Shounen. Atmosphere , Characters , Fights , Osts, emotional moments, Hype, Badass Designs, Good Writing and development , what more can i ask for ?",10,Recommended,"Jun 25, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5570d4d92a,11,4278
"*Mild Spoil* This anime was great and I enjoyed most of the moments which I passed to see this anime . the soundtrack was great especially during battles and sensitive moments . the build up of charracters was also great , the development and improvement of Ichigo , Renji , Madarame , Chad and etc . Of course filler episode would bother you especially the the filler which on that the princess appeared in the living world but I cant blame the cast ( because they started it on the middle of the fight ) .maybe on that time the anime had reached the manga so they should do that or maybe for other reason that I dont know .Whatever , because i watched it in 2021 I could easilly skipped the fillers ( Which I didnt ) . but the worst thing of fillers was that all of the filler villains , suicide themself . actually i find it very ridiculous . there was some other issues for anime watchers ( I dont know that manga answered these questions or not ) : What happened to nel?did she die ? I myself expect that she would join Ichigo's squad ( like Renji ). what happened to ashedo ? did he get back to soul society or not ? Tsukushima didnt die so Chad and others shouldnt be able to take their original memories back , but they get . why ? Despite all of them , I think Bleach is the best Long anime which I've ever seen . it has comedy , drama, action together . and all of them in best forms. of course it could be better , because nothing is perfect but with considering the time which they made this anime , I think it was their best effort . and they have my respect for this beautiful masterpiece and I'm counting moments for the series which is going to be make",10,Recommended,"Sep 6, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4bb03b8d49,11,1668
"Story - The story of bleach is a bit slow on the uptake, but after the first 20 or so episodes, it gets into it and becomes a fast-paced action packed anime - until the fillers kick in. The world that bleach is set in contains some interesting villains, the creatures known only as 'hollows' and other races that are introduced later - and what anime can go without a traitor among them? Also, the 'good' side are filled with their fair share of characters, and each one is given a story behind them which gets explained, so all in all the story goes really in-depth as far as characters go. However, the storyline - this is one that I'd give top marks, all the time you'll be baffled by the feats the main character achieves, the things that happen that you'd not think of in a million years - it makes you think that a genius must have come up with it. But enough about the story, I'll let you give your own verdict on that - but I give it a 10/10, sure some people might think it should lose marks for the slow uptake, but the truth is it's really deep, and the slow uptake sets the scene for later on. Art - In Bleach the art is brilliant, but sometimes they don't do enough FPS and it seems as if it's lagging slightly and has some weird still images in true berserk style (nothing against berserk, it's amazing. Just saying ;)). However, the art is amazing, and the detail given to the characters is true to the storyline, each and every aspect of the characters are there for a reason, right down to the hairpins or the belt buckles! Sound - It depends on which you're talking about... the dubbed, or the subbed. Not much to say about the dubbed version, I don't like the voices that are given to some characters, one of the main characters that's supposed to be a bit tough has a really squeaky voice and pronounces everything wrong. Whereas the way some of them speak, like a little girl in episode 1 - who speaks that politely!? I've got alot to say about the subbed version - the subtitles given are usually good translations (depending on the sites you use) and if you can understand japanese, great. I personally think that the voice actors for each character is fitting, and reflects that char's personality well. For example the main char. I spoke about in the dubbed part, they're given a voice that makes them sound like they're tough and they've been through alot - yet they're still young and inexperienced. And the language, again the little girl - she talks much less formally and it all sounds more easy and realistic. I've given sound a 9 because overall, I think the sound is amazing, but when talking about the anime as a whole, the dubbed version lets it down in places. Character - The anime is given true character, I've watched alot of anime that I can't even list them all on here because I've forgotten the names of half of them and still - I see that this anime is truly original, I don't see anything that's been taken from other animes. The way in which the characters are portrayed, the things that they've added in, the way everything works, the world itself, it's all original! It's amazing! The characters are full of personality, full of mystery, and full of their own little perks. All the characters, even some that only appeared once are given their own storyline and get a detailed biography given, why they act the way they do, what happened before to make them like they are. In true style, the good things that we always want to know are kept a mystery so that it makes us think and conjure up our own solutions until it's explained - I'm not really good at wording this that much but the characters are truly outstanding in my opinion - hence the 10/10 that I cave it. Enjoyment - what can I say, I'm into this anime and I love it. I read the manga and I still enjoy the anime. This anime has given me hours upon end of enjoyment, I love watching the storylines, the fights, the puzzles, and even some of the corny fillers. This anime couldn't give me anymore enjoyment - it's impossible - It's given me everything I could possible take and more already. Overall - Overall this anime has an amazing story, great art, great sound, the anime has truly amazing character, and the characters are so good you feel like crying when something happens to them, or you sit there jumping for joy when the bad guys gone! This anime, over all I gave a 9, because I think the dubbed version lets it down and some of the low fps scenes also let it down. This anime is definitely worth watching, even if you're not into action animes, this anime has a bit of everything, puzzling times, action, even comedy and fun. However if you watch it, watch the SUBBED version! Also I'd suggest reading the manga because the manga contains some truly valuable information that can't be found in the anime! I love this anime - it's still going and almost 300 episodes! 9/10",9,Recommended,"Apr 22, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bcea3c2fce,11,4893
"Story Bleach has a very interesting story that gives both suspense and extreme action. Whether it be battling giant monsters or evil dominators Bleach has it all! Loses points for lousy plot fillers. Art The art style of Bleach is fairly similar to that of Naruto. The art is clean and fresh yet lacks detail compared to anime such as Full Metal Alchemist, Haruhi Suzumiya and Soul Eater. Although... It does however have some of the greatest fight art ever seen in anime. Sound The soundtrack of Bleach whether it be the openings, endings or backing tracks are incredibly diverse and suit the mood well. Character The colourful cast of Bleach makes the anime all that more entertaining from the crazy nature of Isshin Kurosaki to the overly ditsy nature of Orihime Inoue. However some characters can get a little annoying. Enjoyment Considering the anime isn't even finished yet it's enjoyable and suffers some slight drawbacks however, the awesome fights and exciting arcs make up for that loss. Overall Bleach is a really good anime and I do recommend you watch it. Atleast until you've completed the Soul Society arcs. 9/10",9,Recommended,"Sep 3, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45a4313ca1,11,1127
"Bleach is one of the most well known anime series in the world. Ever since I discovered Bleach and began watching it back in the summer of 2011, I was introduced not only to the world of Bleach, but I found the huge world of anime as well. Despite being a big Bleach fan, I understand the show has lots of flaws and I can understand why people would dislike it, though I don't think it deserves all the hate it gets. The story for Bleach is intresting enough but indeed overdone. Ichigo Kurosaki is a highschool boy that can talk to spirts (known as plus). He then discovers Rukia Kuchiki, a soul reaper stationed in the world of the living. When a hollow attacks Ichigo's family Rukia transfers her power to Ichigo and he becomes a substitute soul reaper. From then on Ichigo evolves throughout the course of the series and becomes stronger and facing powerfull opponents. The anime is enjoyable for the most part. There are characters with different personalities and different powers. From soul reapers to quincies, human to hollows, there are lots of factions and species in Bleach that are intresting and fun to see in action. The battles in the show of course can be good when they are DONE RIGHT. Early on in the series I felt that most of the battles were well done. They were simple yet awesome, and quick to the point. However, when the series progressed, the fights started to get boring and repetitive. Ichigo would challenge his opponent, get his ass kicked, use his bankai, get his ass kicked a little more, and then he would somehow find a cheap, unreasonable way to win. Other times when two characters are about to battle, instead of drawing their weapons and murdering each other, they would stand and talk shit to each other for ever and ever. I think this is one of the worst downfalls of both the anime and manga and is something that Kubo should of fixed a long time ago. Nobody wants to see two powerfull warriors talk smack for hours on end, we want to see an epic fight! Anyway, some fights in Bleach are really fun to watch. Good battles from the series include Ichigo VS Byakuya, Ichigo VS Grimmjow, and my all time favorite imo: Hollow Ichigo vs Ulqiuorra. When fights that don't include Ichigo getting thrown around like a rag doll or excessive smack talking are overplayed, the fights are enjoyable to witness and are good entertainment. Another downfall is that Bleach contains WAY too many characters. You have Ichigo and his human friends, his human allies, the soul reaper captains, vice captains, hollow villians, arrancar, espada, filler villans, and some minor characters. Half of these characters hardly even get featured in the entire show for more than 5 minutes. It's a shame too because some of these minor characters have intresting abilites or personalities, yet we hardly ever (sometimes never) see them. On the flipside, the story of Bleach is good and entertaining for awhile. The substitute arc is a good way to start off the series and see Ichigo adapt to his new life as a soul reaper. The soul society arc is by far the most acclaimed and loved arc in all of Bleach, weather or not you are a Bleach fan or not, the soul society arc is a well loved arc with good story, battles, and a well done plot twist. But hey, that's just what I think. It's nice to see Ichigo evolve over the series, but it would also be nice to see other characters get some power development too. Some characters barely evolve throughout the series or they just get a little buffer to their already useless attacks and abilities. Some characters have really cool powers and stuff, but we can't see them become cooler with more powerfull and creative attacks/powers because the power development in this series is whack. If you want a shonen with a good story and entertaining battles and characters, Bleach is the way to go. Is it overrated and contain annoying flaws? Yes. Does it get worse the longer it goes on? Yes. However, Bleach has some goodness to it with battles that will entertain you and a story that will want you to keep watching. For some though, the story gets stale the longer it goes on. I do recommend you watch the first 63 episodes, since they are a blast imo. If you want to keep going, thats fine. If you want to stop, that's also fine. Overall Bleach does have flaws, but if you can look past them at certain times the series can be a fun, action filled ride that will entertain you if you are up for it.",9,Recommended,"Jan 13, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ea6769cca8,11,4454
"Reviewing Bleach is a hard thing to do, due to its inconsistency. The first 50 episodes contained some of the best storytelling I've ever seen. Interesting characters,astonishing fights, shocking plot twists, awesome soundtracks, and a good animation for the 2006 standards. If I had to rate the first seasons, I'd honestly give it a 10/10. Objectively, it might be just an 8 or a 9, but up to this point, it was the anime I enjoyed the most. After those 50 first episodes, Bleach took a huge dive downwards, airing a complete filler Arc with about 40 episodes. To be fair, it wasn't terrible, but didn't fit in the universe at all. Vampires invading heaven? Yeah, that's just a terrible idea. The character development was non-existent, and knowing that there won't be any consequences for the protagonists going into a fight, it was a pretty boring arc. I'd give it a 4/10, because it wasn't enjoyable at all to me. After that, the series got better, reintroducing the actual story by Tite Kubo. Many new interesting characters were introduced, creating great tensions. The feeling of a war coming up was intense, and created a great atmosphere at first. But as soon as things came down to the final fights, you could see that the plot stood in front of the characters like a huge shield. None of the protagonists faced any danger from the eyes of the viewer. The fights weren't one-sided, but the tension from the first arc ws lost entirely. All the newly introduced characters were kinda shoved away, and semmed like canon fodder. This arc displays the main part of the series with about 150 episodes. To be fiar, these 150 episodes were paced pretty good, unlike in other series. There was always something new per episode, progressing the story. Bleach had many ups and downs during that time, with some great scenes bing followed by complete trash. There als o were many filler arcs around 15 episodes per Arc, which didn't bother me although. They were written in a good style, and fit to the universe. They also weren't attempting to extend the plot, but played in some sort of parallel timeline, which I think was very good. If I had to rate these 200 somewhat episodes, I'd give a 7/10. And then there is the last arc... In my eyes, it's complete trash. Bad character design, too complicated plot which made it pretty boring, and full of excuses and convenient coincidences. The quality of the animation got way better, but that's the only good thing about it. I'd give this arc a 4/10 So, to sum it up. Great beginning, which then got pretty bad pretty fast, with some highlights, which couldn't make the series better as a whole.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 31, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_489cb1a8a1,11,2642
"This show had so much potential in the beginning! Tite Kubo came up with a very interesting look on death. However, Kubo and team did not bring the antagonist into the picture until episode 60. The fillers in the series distract the audience and make them forget what the hell is actually going on in the series. Also, when Ichigo is in a fight he gives out a long speech on justice and peace and blah blah blah, then and goes to fight some guy. Wins. Finally, walks away nearly dead but is magically brought back to life by Orihime. Also, the series keeps going on and on and on. It is so boring now that I decided to give up on the whole thing.",3,Not Recommended,"Jan 2, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3d48434749,11,646
"The perfect shonen DOES exist. We all love bleach. It is a well thought out plot, great character development, and is whole and complete. You will almost never feel like you are bored or that an episode is there for ""fluff"". It has a little bit of everything for everyone. To me this series exemplifies the perfect shonen: it is male-centered, action dense, has great plot and character development, has some dark themes added in , but really overall maintains this sort of innocence theme of bettering yourself for the future. It can be silly at times and serious at others.

"The one of the Big 3 w/c alongside One Piece and Naruto, but thankfully being a big 3 means popular not exactly a great anime, the earlier parts of Bleach were Ohh-kay for me but as the series goes it became poor the characters were completely interesting im sure you will pick a lot of great characters here weahter it is a protagonist or antagonist, but the story is a mess as i have said earlier, it is one of the overrated anime's no doubt about that, Glad to hear the series is nearly at its end. i suggest you that don't even watch it if you know you will get dissapointed on the latter part of the series, but if you just want to try it coz it was popular and it is one of the anime's w/c have a huge fan base, go on. But if you are really a pro on anime or a classic fan you will drop this.

"I started Bleach a few months back, and i was some what into it, in till about the part where Rukia gets captured. I feel from there it started to spiral down hill in till it hit rock bottom. What really killed the show for me was that, when Ichigo goes to save Rukia, i was like, ""Oh! This is totally a love interest ( If you look at some of the other animes i watch you will know i enjoy that)"" But when it gets to the part where Ichigo should be like "" I love you Rukia thats why I fought all these battles to come and save you!"" But know it was "" Its Because I owe you!"" So that killed it for me, because i felt that the hole build up was for nothing, so i basically rage quited the Anime.

Bleach is top 3 shounen manga’s out there now. And it's really popular worldwide so if you haven't watched bleach this is review for you. One thing is that you should watch first 30 episodes and then decide if you want to continue series because if you only watch couple episodes you cannot get the feeling and description that is wanted to send all the viewers. Story: Kurosaki ichigo is high scholar whose life is always the same then one day it all turns around. Pretty good story it could been better without filler episodes. This anime describe well Man who wants to protect peoples from bad guys and always training to become stronger. It's kind of same aspect like Naruto. Story 10/10 Art: Art is typical shounen art and really beautiful the whole world in Bleach is beautifully designed. Some places in anime have a more detailed graphics than other but oh well its good enough to watch I guess. Art 10/10 Sound: Both Openings and endings are really good and they are fresh and not so dark kinds of openings. And the music is been signed by the Most popular Japanese bands out there. I just use 3 examples of these bands: - Aqua Timez - They are commonly making Bleach themes and always making me happy with their songs. - UverWorld - These one make cool sounds too in series. - SID Makes couple of openings. Also soundtracks are awesome they are songs that played in series. Sound: 10/10 Character: There is a lot of characters in these show but they have all a background story to tell in anime and they have own unique abilities and strengths. Most of the characters are so funny that you always laugh when you are seeing them saying something funny. Others are always fighting about something and someone’s are really shy and not talk about there is a lot to choose which is good you can found the character that describes you well. Character: 10/10 Enjoyment: So what are my thoughts hmm well they are really good and bad what I mean with this this series have good and bad downhills. Bad downhills are definitely all the filler episodes. Well not all of them but many. Enjoyment: 9/10¨ Overall: Bleach is wonderful shounen series that keeps the flag in high in well enough in situations. And there is seen efforts to make it better.

Bleach is great anime and one of the most popular. Yes it has its problem but show doesn't to be honest. The story has a good concept and is able to Versatile but does have some bad filler and some good filler as well. The main cast are all great characters and are relate able. Besides having some great villains like the popular Grimmjow who is personal favorite if you couldn't tell by my name. Another great villain is aizen who evil with no equal who opposite to the main the hero Ichgio who is another personal favorite of mine as well. People say this series is dumb which I disagree it needs to be brought back.

"Short review of this long popular shounen, this is my favorite anime of all time (probably because I watched it when I was young) but I will try to keep a critical view (impossible lol). The story (as people say) downgrades after the first arc, and it's pretty repetitive at some points (shonen-style level-ups; new villain, more level-ups, etc.) but that's what I like about the show. I am a sucker for shonen after all. Also, it has vibes; good style, music, awesome villains and side characters, and a good mysterious / spirit vibe which creates a somewhat intriguing setting to say the least. The art, for its year, is pretty amazing, a very good-looking anime in my opinion; I would even come to say it looked pretty dang good compared to other anime of its Era. To be honest, I am just biased as I love how the characters look. The sound is what made me like bleach so much, I'm a big fan of music and they just seem to put on the right amount of music, all at the best times depending on the mood of the episode, I remember most of the OSTs by the hearth and have most on my pc and phone. There are a lot of characters introduced, of course, some are useless, annoying (Orihime), and not very well developed, but what can I say, it has 366 episodes and in consequence, A LOT of characters, some of them are gonna annoy you for sure (unfortunately she is part of the main cast lol). Still, I am a sucker for edge lord characters and villains; and I would say the villains in this show are top-notch. I recommend this show to anybody who likes typical shounen anime and mystery, also I need to mention that there are a lot of fillers (which I also enjoyed) but I recommend skipping them if you want full enjoyment of the show, else if you really love bleach, watch the fillers too, I personally think they were interesting. Critically I give this show an 8.5-9/10, but in my heart, (especially because of the OST) I give this show a 10/10.",9,Recommended,"Jan 7, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd9da91b6b,11,1944
"Bleach is an iconic Series that has earned its place in one of the most known and loved titles around the anime community. A series that made use of art and style to bring to life characters and give them value outside of being another villain of the week. The music and sound bring shivers to those that truly enjoy anime when exploring the beginning phases of a new world to learn about. Pros: The series has loveable characters, and can serve as a fairly decent story for most watchers. Early on to the midpoint, the anime has some of its' best story arcs. It's a show that explores some cultural mythology and folklore in a modern japan setting. The use of fighting and abilities through swords and ""spirit"" energy. The anime shines in part due to the extended universe and fillers that arent' really apart of the manga. Movies and arcs would be great for fans. The series stands out with mostly its' style, art, and sound. Cons: The biggest flaw with Bleach would be the sudden anime cancelation that led to a long hiatus. As well as the reality that when the anime return it will have to suffer through the story that started to become flawed due to the rushing of the manga. Along with some lack of exploration into some of the more Major and minor abilities that make up the world of bleach. It leaves a desire left unsatisfied for those interested in such topics.",9,Recommended,"Feb 21, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a70f4481a5,11,1372
"Bleach has been compared to a lot of leading series today particularly with Naruto and One Piece. One of the reasons is the obvious fact that all the three have the same action-packed story. But the most notable reasons, well of course, the three has been the most popular series for many years. So it’s not strange that people are comparing the “Big Three”. But like Naruto and One Piece, Bleach has its own uniqueness and charm. Something that only this series has. There’s a very long review coming…………… About the STORY The story is very well-made and I gonna admit, Mr. Tite Kubo has a very rich imagination to be able to create such wonderful stories with captivating settings. It’s very original in the sense that it is influenced with so much Japanese materials. Not only the Shinigamis are like samurais but there’s also the combination of ancient Japanese period which is the Soul Society and the modern Japanese period which is the Karakura Town. The most interesting is that these two eras meet because of the main protagonist, Ichigo. The fighting scenes are not just one of the bests but in fact the best even among Naruto and One piece. Together with the most amazing and magnificent animation, every fighting scene is genuinely breath-taking, almost like watching a Hollywood movie. Every arc is interesting and so exciting which includes arcs that are not in the original manga story. Not only is the series packed with so much action and adventure but with drama also. I believe that in order for a series to work it should not only focus to one or two genre. It’s that unexplainable work of the author that despite for having so many genres, he manages to balance it, and the end result is one magnificent story. And if I may add, there are lots of series that have a very interesting main plot but after reading and watching the whole thing, you will be unsatisfied, unlike this one. The reason maybe because they didn’t manage to live up with the main storyline and in some point the story just went to a different direction. Not all series with a good plot is worth watching and a great series is not only about the main plot but how the every chapter and storyline goes well with the main plot. Mr. Tite Kubo manages to do that and almost perfect for that matter. After reading and watching his work, I always end up reflecting on it before going to sleep and that’s what having a great experience is in my book. About the CHARACTERS There are a wide range of characters and because the series does not only focuses on Ichigo you will really had to have a favorite. I, for myself, have been in love with the character of Byakuya ever since I first saw him. I believe Byakuya is next to Ichigo in the most favorite characters on this series. He’ll captivate you not only by his drop dead gorgeous looks, mysteriousness, and powerful techniques but you’ll also be captivated by his very sincere and chivalrous personality. I also love Zaraki whom I believe is one of the genuinely one of the most powerful character in the entire Bleach World, because whenever he appears in a crisis when all hopes seem gone, you will feel an assurance that he will save the day. Though not as physically strong as Zaraki, I also think that whenever Kurotsuchi appears it will surely give you an assurance that they will win. He has this mysterious aura of being one of the most powerful among the Captains. And because he is such a genius, he is usually the one who knows what is happening around and what to do about it. It is so great that both them are in the side of Ichigo because if they’re not it would be a disaster. On the other hand, it is funny that even with Chad, Ishida, and Inoue being the main protagonists, they are rarely seen because it is an obvious fact that everyone is more into the Shinigamis. I also love the characters of the very mysterious Urahara and Yorouichi. They would always appear in moments when you think the villains are already winning. Not to mention that they always know everything as in everything that is happening not only in the living world but also in soul society. Almost everyone in the series will excite you whenever they appear because you’ll know it would be an intensifying fight. It’s very fascinating to see whenever they use their Zanpakuto and reveals their own unique powers. You will also have favorites in the lines of villains. Ulquiorra is my number one favorite villain in this series. In fact, he is my number three in my lists of Bleach characters next to Ichigo and Byakuya. His very calm, enigmatic, confident, and very much interesting considering he’s an enemy. He portrays somewhat of a naïve individual with regards to the feelings of human beings that’s why he’s very much interested to Inoue. I really feel so sad that I don’t get to see him after his fight with Ichigo. I also love the weird and complicated but definitely very special relationship of Rukia and Ichigo. Oftentimes it genuinely feels like their relationship is romantic. About KUROSAKI ICHIGO The reason why his character stands out and interesting is the fact that he stands between being a human, a Shinigami, a Vizard, and lately a fullbringer. It’s like he connects the three worlds and that makes him a very effective main character. It feels so amazing that because he is the only one that you really can’t define what his category is among the four beings, he is the only one of his kind in the series and that makes him really the main protagonist. And to add to that, there’s this evil side of him that makes him more and more interesting. Seeing him transformed with his fight with Ulquiorra was fascinating but his fight with Aizen, “SHIT”, was the best fight among all of his fights. Not only he looked so damn cool when he became the Final Getsuga but seeing Aizen so damn worked up was even more wonderful to see. The best feeling after so many years of watching Bleach. Among all action characters not only in this series but in all animes of all time, Ichigo is number one in my lists. His fights are always amazing that sometimes I am holding my breath as to not miss a thing. About the ANIMATION and SOUND I am not a technical type of person and I don’t have much knowledge with types of animation but I strongly believe that the strong point of Bleach is its animation. The animation is so damn good, it’s almost as if watching a Hollywood Animation Film. Every fight comes with intense visual effects and to add, a good sounds on the background. Every transformation is so great to witness that I sometimes wish I can also do that even with my age. Whether protagonist or antagonist, every character is very much well-made. Such beautiful characters accompanied with wonderful landscapes will make you captivated. It feels so surreal to see how the animation matures every year. Watching previous episodes and seeing how the characters and landscapes changed beautifully over the years is so amazing. It’s like watching your child grow up. I think this series has the best animation of all the series of all time. Plus, they can also show their fashion statement whenever they are in the world of the living. It is cool and nice to see all the fashionable characters. And to ass, I don’t know if everyone notices it but for some reason all characters looked gloomy. Unlike others, all the characters in this series looked so serious and sad. Not that it affects the awesomeness of the animation. The sounds in this series are very well used in every episode. They also still use the important soundtracks even after so many years. You had to have a collection of all the soundtracks and listen to it all the time. With that all said, it is no wonder why Bleach has been one of the most popular not only in Japan but internationally as well. Whether it is in manga, anime, game, and movie form, this series is really a hit. I am enjoying it a lot. Every arc is worth to watch.

"Bleach is one of the big three anime (bleach, naruto and one piece) for a reason. If you care a lot about logic, standard fight rules and stuff like that, bleach is not your cup of tea. Like how in many fights ichigo is crushed by the enemy and instead of working with whatever he has and using a strategy to defeat the nemy, he just gets a new transformation out of nowhere (pretty much like dragon ball z). However, the fights are still pretty enjoyable. However, if you forget about all that and just watch the fights that are extremely epic accompanied with great animation, you can have the time of your life. Out of the big three anime, Bleach has a kind of a mature feel to it, you feel like you are watching something much more than your average anime. There isn't much of a power level system in bleach, like how ichigo defeats a certain person in his shikai (first transformation) and that certain person after just a few weeks or so defeats an enemy that crushed ichigo in his bankai (second transformation which is more than 5 times stronger than shikai). Some flaws in logic like this may irritate you if you care about things like that a lot. The soundtrack is pretty good and well timed. The episodes on the other hand are more than fifty percent fillers that at times don't even go with the stor. In bleach, except for the Bount arc, all other fillers just suck. I recommend you skip them. When I rewatched Bleach I skipped the fillers and realized how much better the anime was without all the fillers annoying you for twenty or so episodes per saga. So it all depends on whether you want to watch the fillers for the sake of completing the anime or skip them. Every anime watcher must watch at least one of the big three anime, Bleach won't be such a bad choice since it is shorter and has already ended (the manga is still going on though).",9,Recommended,"May 29, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d3785a22cf,12,1859
"Bleach was an amazing anime. It was unfortunately quite slow to start and there was a lot of character development in a long amount of time that wasn't totally necessary. There are a few filler series in there that do not relate to the manga and are basically never mentioned again which is a shame as the Zanpaktou Rebellion arc was superb and the manifestations should have stayed on to become permanent characters. However the series that are relevant were fantastic for the most part. The story was well put together, there were some lovely twists to the plot and the characters were much better with the voices that they were given, all of which absolutely fits with the characters personalities.Bleach is a fantastic anime and anyone who is just joining the anime community or hasn't seen it yet, it is a great anime which lasts long and can start a journey down a beautiful and awesome path.",9,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8bb99de62c,12,898
"*SPOILERS AHEAD* I would've given it a 10 but i really didn't like the idea that Ichigo gave up his powers in order to defeat Aizen (When he used the final Getsuga Tenshō) cuz the final Getsuga Tenshō was EXTREMELY overpowered instead he could have simply fought him with his all without the final Getsuga Tenshō, just normal Getsuga Tenshōs would've done fine cuz after all the objective is not to kill him (because it's impossible) the objective was to get him weak enough so Urahara's trap kido would work on him. i mean yeah sure the idea was that Ichigo was fighting a literal god so he must sacrifice something in order to defeat him but then they shouldn't have made Ichigo SO POWERFUL like i mean he could've beaten the head master yamamuto in his dangai form EASILY so maybe if they wanted to make him lose something that important then just make him a teensy bit stronger than Aizen.

"This is my favorite anime since I was 13 years old, I met him when I was starting in this world of anime, Man if you're starting and want a great shounen or like a good anime from the 2000s I highly recommend it, there's its strengths like: Good Characters a very interesting Lore and epic fights but it has its flaws, like the large number of holes and the plot starts to decay a little from the fullbringer arc, but otherwise it's still likeable, it's not terribly bad, it's just problems with a long plot, anime like naruto one piece Dragon ball suffer a lot from this, but otherwise I strongly recommend it! problem with this anime is the fillers that are too much, but consume little of the work but talking more about the few positives of the work, we have great fights and very striking characters.",7,Recommended,"Apr 7, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_324b696848,12,805
"To be very precise this is a Shonen and that too from the early 2000s. When I was deciding to watch one from the big 3, I chose this why? Because this is relatively shorter than the other two. So if you skip the fillers it is the best out of the three to get your attention and pass your time. Now the reasons to watch this anime:- 1. Bleach in my opinion has one of the best character designs in any animated medium. 2. If you like characters who don't have huge aspirations like becoming the best ninja or pirate not to say that they're bad, you should watch bleach. Ichigo is very interesting in that way. 3. Bleach has one of the best world buildings which is confusing at first but if you pay close attention the story will give you all the answers. To put it simply it's based on different buddhist realms. 4. Really good fights like with every battle shonen. 5. The main character's power transformation is just great. 6. It decisively has the best soundtrack amongst the big 3 which will give you the early 2000s rock nostalgia. 7.It was the anime which inspired many modern dhows like JJK. My only criticism for the anime is almost half of it is filler which takes the overall anime rating down however the adaptation of the story from the manga is dedicatedly done. IF YOU WANNA WATCH IT PLS PUT SHONEN EXPECTATIONS ON IT DON'T EXPECT IT TO BE AOT OR EVEN THE MORE RECENT SHONENS LIKE JJK. IF YOU CAN BE A BIT PATIENT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SHONENS OUT THERE.",7,Recommended,"Jan 1, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bda9569694,12,1470
"Bleach always make me feel happy and warms my heart everytime, there is so many iconic scenes that makes bleach so perfect! the OST is out of this world which adds so many enjoyment while watching the show. the characters design is top tier in most parts, ichigo's relationship with his squad and orihime is awesome, i feel like every character got their own stage at least once.. bleach is iconic in it's own way and its outstanding, also its fun to watch ichigo blowing up some hollows. :) kubo inspired so many people and will keep doing it, amazing adaptation in my opinion",10,Recommended,"Dec 22, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b44e19a593,12,577
"the big three as you all know bleach , one piece and naruto. Bleach is unique out of these three. Thats coming from a one piece fan you know?. First and foremost, unlike naruto which was full of plot holes, I actually enjoyed watching bleach for its plot. how the story evolved from a regular high school student to being a shinigami. That transformation was more than enough to enjoy it. Although a classic shounen formula, bleach takes it in a different way. For its plot alone I would give it a 8/10. Seeing how the villain(not gonna say who it is) slowly grows into the plot.Thats fantastic. Second the animation, of course it was the golden era of anime not all anime studios have to budget to master it, so bleach at its initial stages was wonky but as it progressed even the characters got better, I just love Kubo draws his women characters especially Rangiku and Orihime and of course who can forget Yoruichi(if u don't like her u must have mental illness).That aside. Animation was its best by the end of the series so the upcoming eps must have stellar animation.hope so. Soundtrack was the bombbbb! And I am in love with the character ost. Some Ops were really amazing, that became my jam. It has this 90's western vibes.The later part of series like Hueco Mundo Arc and even Aizen's OST gave it a Mexican vibe .I absolutely love the variety in Soundtrack.Watch bleach just for the soundtrack. Character wise u will love a lot of dope characters like Kenpachi, Byakuya, Renji, these guys rocked the show. Kubo really overdid the characters so he had to nerf Kenpachi.(Absolutely love him he's a true beast).Giving voice to soul slayers is something out of the ordinary so they did a great job with that. overall if ur new to anime then u will enjoy watching bleach, and if u have watched naruto and then coming to bleach, good news u will enjoy it. As of now out of the big three, One piece still reigns supreme over storytelling, world building and characters variety, but bleach still has dope fight scenes, decent power system,amazing characters, with a dope villain. My only complaint is the number of filler eps, and blatant fall of espada number 1,2,3.if only we got to have a deep understanding of some characters bleach could have been better.",10,Recommended,"Nov 16, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_825515c37b,12,2263
"I loved this anime, all in all. I've liked it every since I was a kid. However, I didn't enjoy the insane amount of fillers. If they would've stuck to the main plot, I would have no complaints as for as plot goes. Many people say that the season went bad after the (I'll say it this way so that it's not a spoiler) big fight, but I disagree. As far as character development goes, continuing the story was a good move. I'm not only here for one set of foes, I'm here for Ichgo and the supporting characters. I gave sound a nine because I didn't enjoy the changes the made in the voicing. I figured most of that couldn't be helped, therefore I only deducted one point. I give it an overall nine simply because of the miner bugs in this seasons. The final episode was the best I could've asked for.

"Welcome to yet another review of mine. This time it will be Bleach, third on my watch list, and my first anime crossing 100 episodes (I will need to re-watch DBZ). Before I begin, let me clear this, there were multiple seasons in the anime, and one more in manga which haven’t aired, but I will rather sum them up to just 4 seasons excluding the frequent fillers. Season 1, Soul Society. Season 2, Battle with Aizen. Season 3, Fullbringer. Season 4, Quincy. Since season 4 is a manga only season, I won’t be referring it. I will also refer all the fillers season as one. Concept: 7.0 The main concept was based on ‘Soul Reapers’ and apart from not being as unique as others we have seen till now, this concept wasn’t even properly laid out in the show. There were numerous contradictions, and much of the idea was based on vague propositions. Firstly, I really never got the idea of Soul Society. The souls here would have families, they would age, and some would even die eventually. Yes, of course, when we watch the show, we hardly care about this facts, but when you give a deeper look, you will find it all too weird. Souls can come to earth whenever they like, which is acceptable, but then they can marry with humans, have kids, and age like all humans do. Seriously? The concept of hollows was fine, with hollows being the evil spirits. But when they consume other hollows, they regain their sense(fine), feelings and emotions(for real?). It was as if you were trying to force the supernatural Soul Reaper thing in an otherwise real world scheme. And the concepts of Fullbrigers, mystical earrings, and quincies were rather forced one too. Nothing blended, and the entire concept were just forced here and there to make sense for the storyline. What I personally felt was something like this: there were three nations, the World, Hueco Mundo and the Soul Society. And people from these nations were at a constant war with each other. Some people from this nations had unique powers and abilities. The story begins with a boy from the ‘World’ nation, who is later revealed to be a hybrid, since his parents were from different nations. The villain happened to be a ‘Soul Society’ citizen who ditched his own country and allied with the ‘Hueco Mundo’ nation. His plans were to be the ruler of all three nations, and to rule the entire world (universal one). And now, only this hybrid guy can stop his evil plans. Makes more sense, right? Storyline: 8.0 The story of this show is a rather simple one. There is no mystery, suspense, or any missing clue type of thing. Everything goes linearly. There was never any big picture of any conspiracy, and no interesting plots were there to be unravelled. Of course, this makes it ideal for casual viewing, as there is nothing to guess. Aside from this, there were certain, or many I would say, plot holes which didn’t have any satisfactory explanations. And if you consider the filler seasons, then it takes a more deeper dip than one can imagine. Aside from content to watch, the fillers had nothing to offer, and their storyline was way too horrible. Characters: 9.9 Bleach had a sheer number of characters, and when one could expect an inverse relation between quantity and quality, each one of the character introduced in Bleach had ample space and time to progress. I really liked this aspect of the show. I have always been a big fan of series with lots of characters, but generally in such series, a lot of detailing of the characters is left out and all of them have no depth to it. Bleach, somehow, managed to overcome this issue. Each character was detailed well enough, and all had some or the other back stories, which not only connected, but were completely acceptable and satisfying. Speaking of the individual characters, Sosuke Aizen, the antagonist, is by far my favourite character, and the best villain I had seen so far. I really liked the way he picked up fights with all the dangerous and powerful characters of Soul Society, with no regrets, hesitation or fear and maintained his cool even when he was being sentenced. That character was just amazing and brilliant, and coolness etched from every action of his. Not to mention those I-Don’t-Give-A-What look he used to give to all those heroes, that used to be so hilarious. Aside from this, we all have been huge fans of characters like Starrk (another cool villain), Shunsui (made my stomach ache with his humour), Gin (seriously, he gave me such intense feels), Ulquiorra (just awesome), Kisuke (that man, deserves all respects), Hollow Ichigo (I loved that maniac) and so much more. I won’t be wrong to conclude that characters really were a strong point of this show. Tragedies: 8.7 Spoilers Alert! No, there were certainly no tragedies, and that made the so much predictable. After watching a few episodes, we simply learn the fact that no matter how hard the fight is, our heroes will always be safe, and that never kept me on my toes. There were many tense moments when we anticipated something bad to happen, but that bad never happened, and eventually we stopped filling those tense moments itself in the first place. Yea! this worked in favour too, (Spoiler!) because by the time we reached the Aizen Saga, we stopped expecting bad things, and all of a sudden we faced the truth of Gin, immediately followed by his death, and that struck my chord so hard, I was left in shock for the next 7 days. Honestly speaking, Gin’s death is the only reason this show gets a 8.7 instead of a 7 in tragedies section, because that one was not at all obvious, or at least it had never been to me. I got so accustomed to the merry-go endings of events, that I had stopped being sceptical of characters and the moment Gin’s truth was revealed, I was completely shocked. But there was a reassuring in my head, that, now, since Gin is a good guy, he won’t die, and at that very moment he gets stabbed, and I was like, no that can’t be, that’s impossible, he shouldn’t be killed. After that, I remember myself surfing on the internet for a whole week, trying to find hopes for Gin’s survival. His death was definitely the most epic death of all times (clashing with FMA Hughes) in anime, and it became more memorable because of its unexpectancy. Even today, thinking about Gin makes me very depressed and sad. But other than that, there were not much tragedies, although this one was more than enough. I would also like to add, that, from what I have heard, Season 4, which is manga only as of now, have all the major tragedies necessary for the story, yet missing from the three seasons. But since it isn’t on anime yet, I can’t factor it yet. Pace: 7.0 Utterly and butterly poor, and lacklustre. Out of 22 minutes of running time of a single episode, 5 minutes were wasted on soundtrack and specials, and 10 minutes were wasted on either recaps, or re runs of last episodes, In simpler words, each episode offered only 7 ~ 10 minutes of new content. What could have been covered in 1 episodes is essentially stretched over 5 different episodes. And what to say about the filler? Not were they only horrible, but they slowed the show so much, that its no wonder this series ratings dropped so quickly and dramatically. The fillers were the nail in the coffin for this show. And they completely ruined it. Soundtrack: 10 Fantastic. And truly memorable. Firstly, the opening (and few ending) themes were so good to watch and listen, that it gave this show an another edge. I remember how excited I used to be whenever I saw a new opening, and the visuals were so cool (especially because we were so much connected with all the characters), that I often found myself not blinking at all so that I don’t miss out a single scene. And the original sound track, it was not only just awesome, it was fantastic, and even today, when you hear it, you feel so nostalgic. ‘Soundscape to ardor’, ‘Clavar La Espada’, ‘Treacherous’, ‘Escalon’ were among my favourite. In fact the reason I love this show, is because of its insanely strong soundtrack. The moment it played during the show, you will all get so hooked up that you could feel your heart racing in the flow. Be it an emotional scene, or a fighting scene, or a moment of triumph, the sound really captured the essence and delivered so much that you won’t want to miss a single scene or sound. Still today, whenever I am reminiscing, I would generally listen to its soundtrack and I would feel so nostalgic, that eventually I fall depress, for such a beauty build up of sound will no longer be there again (of course that’s not completely true, there are many more anime with great soundtracks). Sometimes, I wonder, that it was the soundtrack that made us feel connected with the characters and the show more rather than the storyline. Whatever be it, this show proves how an awesome soundtrack can help a show. Real Life Values: 8.5 Many people complain that the show didn’t have much of the real life values, and while I agree with them, I would also say that it wasn’t even completely devoid of them. There were trivial values like friendships and sacrifices and there were even complex values like what is true justice. Captain Tozen wanted justice, but he strayed from the true justice he had always envisioned. Often, in real life, it sometimes gets too hard to decide what is just and what is not, and siding with one or the other can lead to highly different outcomes. Content: 9.0 The show had a fair amount of humour, emotions, and action scenes. The show had some pervert jokes as well, but they were all acceptable, or to some extent they were. Speaking of humour, this show wasn’t an all out humour show, so of course you won’t find yourself sitting with your stomach in hand, but of course, there was ample comic relief and casting aside the fillers, it had quality too. Emotions were loaded in as well. In fact the all time pervert Rangiku had a serious emotional turn about during the end of Aizen saga. Orihime, of course, was the trademark for all the emotional content, but I preferred the softer sides of the villains more than anything else. I was sad, the way Ulquiorra died (I was not depressed, because I knew he had to die anyway), because his character really grew throughout his occurrences, and his coldness was a form of emotion as well. Last but not the least, this show had completely awesome and satisfying action and fighting scenes. The battles sometimes took more than 5 episodes to end, but that never bored me. In fact it kept me all tuned up (a little thanks to the soundtrack for that). All in all, the show had enough content to watch, and I never got bored out of it. Animation: 9.0 The earlier episodes have a ‘meh’ animation (technology boundations), but later on the animation turns out to be just fine. The action scenes are amazing. There are like 100 Cero blasts, 250 Getsuga Tenshos and 500 flash steps, but each time they happen, its amazing to watch. All the explosions and cero blasts were friendly to the eyes, without any unnecessary and irritating flashing lights. Speaking about the art, well, all the characters had distinct and excellent art. The villains especially were really cool, they definitely had those ‘evil eyes’, and I was very fond of those. Climax: 8.5 Climax of this show could have been something, only if there were no fillers. When I talk about fillers, I can’t even talk about climax, because whenever it tried to build up, another filler will pour water upon it. That apart, its hard to talk about climax in such shows, because, practically, in each and every fight that happens, a climax builds up. And especially in Bleach, I would say, all the fights that took place had that climax and post-climax thing. The major climax in the plot was of course the battle with Aizen. And just prior to that major event, we are warmed up by several other fights, and the manner they take place one after another, our excitement surmounts in anticipation of the final battle. And our expectations are met as well. The final battle between Ichigo and Aizen was definitely a battle worth watching, and properly justified and quenched the viewers thirst. The post climax was short yet adequate. Especially, the part when Rangiku accepts everything and decides to move on, was a touchy and beautiful thing. I still gave it 8.5, because of the season 4 with the fullbringers, which had climax build up. That season started and ended much before I knew what was happening. That said, it’s no doubt why people sometimes don’t even consider that season a season. Final Score : 8.56 So, for my closing thoughts, I would say, Bleach is definitely an anime worth watching. It’s a fair mix of action, emotion and humour, and with its strong soundtrack and character cast supporting it, you will never get bored out of it. Yes, the fillers can sometimes annoy you, but given the fact that the fillers have absolutely no effect on the major plot line, you can as well as skip them totally in the first place. But of course, if time makes you a big Bleach fan, then watching those fillers isn’t gonna hurt you either. It’s like something more to watch of your favourite anime, that’s all.",8,Recommended,"Feb 6, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0b19943d0e,12,13198
"I honestly loved watching Bleach, i'll admit now that i only got to watch the English dubbed as i struggle to read sub titles but that said! it was quite the show to watch and Johnny Yong Bosch playing the role of Ichigi for the dub version was a great touch to it all really, he really brought Ichigo's character to life and as i enjoyed the show it got more n more intense for me each time just waiting for the next episodes to release, now that its sadly on a complete hold and no more episodes will be aired its like losing the one thing i looked forward to but still like i said i get to read the manga now for the first time. Overall i'd rate Bleach as being way up there with all the other popular animes and it deserves all the viewers and support all together, its possibly the only anime i can say i truly like with a passion and watching it makes me (laugh, happy, excited, and very involved) in the story and its characters. Hopefully i'll see more from the Bleach series in the future but for now i'll just keep watching the repeats and the movies over and over again until i die because in all honesty! i could never ever get bored of watching it.",10,Recommended,"Feb 7, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6620d91e47,12,1161
"In almost every way, Bleach is almost the polar opposite in terms of a TV show. The animation is sometimes haphazard, and the character designs are nothing special...even verging on ugly at times. The opening theme is very catchy, but the music beyond that isn't memorable. The show at times is painfully slow and follows far too many clichéd conventions of the shonen genre, and some plot holes are achingly obviously. And yet...while this is not a great show by any means, it is a good one, and it's precisely because it has heart. I can't describe any better why I got wrapped up into seeing this tale of a demon hunter, but it has a resonance that 2nd Gig just didn't have. Ichigo is a relatively normal (if morose) teen who started seeing spirits a few years back. Most of the time, it wasn't an issue...just an annoyance, really. But when he and his family are attacked, through a series of circumstances he is granted the power of a soul reaper. Soul reapers, it turns out, are a sort of gatekeeper to the netherworld, and they fulfill a few roles. One of their tasks is to help souls who have, due to personal attachments to this world, stuck around rather than passing over into the ""Soul Society."" Most of the time, these spirits are harmless, and they may wander around for a long time since soul reapers are usually busy with a far worse problem: hollows. Hollows are nasty creatures that like to eat souls, and their bone-white masks often conceal the spirits of those whom they've overtaken to become more powerful. Soul reapers have the thankless task of defeating them and sending them (and their intended victims) over to the ""other side."" So Ichigo now has more problems than he ever thought possible. For one, hollows recognize his incredibly strong spiritual energy and think he'd make a tasty snack, so they show up often. Second is Rukia, the soul reaper from whom he received his powers. When Ichigo gained his powers, Rukia lost most of hers, so for now she's stuck living in his closet, explaining just what the heck is going on to Ichigo and trying to keep him from getting himself killed. Add in two sisters and a wacky dad, a girl with a crush on him and a gaggle of friends who start catching on to his spirit-fighting abilities, a wacko substitute soul that resides in a stuffed tiger, and a guy whose business acts as an arms dealer for soul reapers, and Ichigo's got far more than what he can handle. As I was saying before, Bleach does not have a great deal on which to recommend it, at least on the surface. Quite frankly, what would be the first DVD's worth of material is just plain junk, full of formulaic pap that was so easy to predict that I almost gave up. The opening has Rukia acting as an omniscient narrator, explaining every last strange thing that Ichigo experiences. It's unnecessary, and it lessens the mystery of the moment when this kid gets himself into this strange, fantastical, and scary world. For a while, even past the first few episodes, Bleach seems too interested in defining terms rather than creating a world. There's also the problem that none of the hollows that Ichigo faces are interesting villains. They have their own peccadilloes, but there is no sense that the hollows are anything but self-interested stomachs. They certainly don't work together, and they do not pose that great of a threat as stand-alone baddies. For too much of this first season, hollows exist to fulfill the shonen need to have at least one or two fight scenes every single episode. On top of all this, Ichigo is a rather bland character. Yes, he has parental issues stemming from his mother's death, but what shonen character doesn't have something similar in his past? He doesn't seem to have any interests or character qualities other than being sullen and dismissive, yet that appeals to many of the girls who find him a mystery. In many ways, though, he's a blank slate. I also have to say from a personal perspective that the show's viewpoint on the afterlife is really disturbing and depressing. It is very Japanese, to be certain, but if this show was an accurate picture of what happened after death, I'd prefer just to stay dead, thank you very much. I admit that as a future pastor, it may be something I notice more than others; nevertheless, this show did somehow bother me more than many other supernaturalistic anime. So why can I still give a basic recommendation to Bleach? It's because the show is watchable, for one. It doesn't take itself too seriously and winds up, despite its repetitive nature, being a lot of fun. I found myself coming back morning after morning to catch another episode, and I believe it's due to the strength of the ensemble cast and their support of Ichigo. From obvious girlfriend interest Orihime to Japanese/Mexican gentle giant Chad, the supporting members of Bleach are really what make this show interesting. They are the ones that I really wanted to learn more about, and thankfully that happens. About midway through the first season, we get some episodes that barely involve Ichigo, but for me they really established the larger network of characters. Now that isn't to say that they always handle these characters correctly. For example, the constant jokes about Orihime's large bustline are really out of place, especially considering that she is a sweet, kind character who would probably be embarrassed and burst into tears if anyone made those comments to her face. But again, this is a shonen program meant to appeal to 13-year-old boys, and sometimes that audience wins out. That said, though, I found that almost all the expanded cast did get good moments to shine, and at least a couple of them who appear to be one-dimensional get the chance to improve over time. One thing is certain: not every character is what he or she appears at first glance, and I like that a lot. In fact, it's Bleach's radical turns in its final episodes of the season that made me interested in continuing. The hollows almost fall out of the picture entirely as events surrounding Rukia lead us somewhere entirely different and unexpected, and it leads to a variety of characters stepping up to their destinies. I had no expectations of this from the first half of the season, and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. It's been said that all shonen shows need time to ""get better."" It's almost a cliché in and of itself that long-running epics sometimes take longer to get off the ground, and that's true here. If I were to judge the show off the first several episodes, I wouldn't be sure whether or not I'd skip it. But if you can get through the twenty episode mark that ends season one, my guess is you'll be hooked. I can't say that I'm going to run out and find season two soon; other shows have captured my interest more that I still need to finish. However, I've given recommendations to other shonen shows (like The Prince of Tennis) that aren't nearly as interesting and don't show nearly as much promise. And that, friends, is probably why I think the first season of Bleach is worth watching -- the show is slowgoing at first, but it looks ready to take us all sorts of interesting places in future seasons.",8,Recommended,"May 5, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bd53cd65d8,12,7210
"This is like narrating my experience. Manga: I've read the so called Big 3: One Piece, Naruto, Bleach and lets include Hitman Reborn and all the the shows included in the Shounen Wave. I love Shounen and if this is valid, I think I have read almost all the mangas that were part of the Shounen Decade (2002-2012) in my country and as much as my knowledge in the manga is concern, Bleach and Yu Yu Hakusho has the most amazing fights in manga. My Top 5 Shounen mangas are: Yu Yu Hakusho, Bleach, Hitman Reborn, One Piece and Naruto Anime: I will have to write about the art, sound, character, enjoyment and overall. Art: Kubo was actually listed as one of the best mangaka in the history of Japan manga. He has a perfect and unique style. I am not here to compare so I will isolate this show and see the beauty of art in its own way and give rating. For me it is actually 9, it is the highest I could possibly give because the characters matches the plot and the setting. It has both modern and old setting. Sound: no other anime would beat the coolness of the sound. I always refer manga than anime but I would never thought the sounds will be one of the reasons to keep on watching the anime. Their opening and closing soundtracks are the best. Their background musics are cool, I love the Caribbean style music in almost all of the protagonist-meets-the-antagonist scenes. Character: One of the things that I want from a mangaka is to have a trademark. You know that moment when you see a character and you immediately recognize them because of the character style. About the characters in the story, there's so much unexpected personalities and brilliant characters. There are a lot of surprises. Kubo loves a twist in every character. What I really love is how the flashback tear me into pieces. I don't cry but tell me a deep story behind the reason why behind the rebellion of the antagonist and I'll give you a well overflowing of tears. Their sword/katana's shape will depend on your Spiritual Pressure, they have names and different techniques which will make you curious. Well, my favorite character has not yet released his final katana technique. How interesting! Enjoyment: The show betrayed me. It had blind me for my lust of sword fights. I really love the sound of katana from the moment it's drawn. I rated it as 10 because in my opinion Bleach has the most awesome fights. In every fight, if it is possible not to blink an eye, I would! I enjoyed but you've heard about Bleach's nuisance fillers right? If someone dropped this show, not because of the anime itself but because of those fillers. Overall: I have first read the manga and the moment I started reading I just realized I can't get enough of the story until the day came that I shocked myself because there is nothing left anymore and I'm on the latest release already. I like this show not because it is Bleach, i have been following it since 2009 and it is not clearly as famous as of how it is 2 years ago. The story has a unique plot and similar to ancient stories and or should i say the Greek mythology. i am a fan of Greek mythology and i see the characters as the gods/goddesses of heaven and the main antagonist as the angel who rebelled against everyone because he thinks he's superior than everyone. This show made me feel like I wanted to become a soul reaper someday instead of being scared with soul reapers. Funny as it may seem but you'll understand once you have watched the series. There will be a moment where you will think of ""What if/s"" (e.g. ""What if this is real and we only can't see them because we're just humans?"") The show by the way originally have scythe as their main weapon instead of sword but Kubo is like the guy who does not come up with a conclusion easily like how he changed the series' title for countless times. The best decision he made was to turn scythe into swords or katana. Genius indeed.",8,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a885b66ac7,12,3915
"Bleach - the name itself is fishy but do not worry 'cause the story is not about household duties |Act I| Story [7] Basically what the heck is 'Bleach' about ? Lemme explain it to you shortly. 'Bleach' is all about fighting, reaching new levels of strength and other minor stuff that entertains a shounen (boy). The main protagonist is 'Kurosaki Ichigo', a boy who became a substitute shinigami in order to defend his loved ones. I do not want to spoil the story to you, but i'll tell ya why i've given it a 7. From the very beginning 'Bleach' is very interesting to watch and your organism asks for more. It begins to act like some sort of fuel to you. Why does this happen ? Because 'Bleach' is a damn awesome show at its early stage (~1-60). But after that fillers begin to show up and it makes you feel a bit disappointed. Also the actual plot weakens and if you follow closely then you will notice some plot holes and things that do not make any sense. All in all it is quite good for a long-running anime. |Act II| Art [9] Maybe some of you will disagree but ,man, i like the 4:3 aspect ratio format more than the 16:9 one. I'm thankful that 'Bleach' kept this ratio for about 150 episodes. So back to the point. The art in this show is about excellent. Pierrot did a good job at animating 'Bleach' cause the art is so smooth and few stuff is censored. In terms of art 'Bleach' is great and there are not any issues regarding it. |Act III| Sound [8] Well 'Bleach' has got awesome openings and endings. There aren't any that i disliked, there are only some that i found annoying after a period of time. Also there are several songs in the original soundtrack that i still enjoy, after watching over 300 episodes. You will notice that 'Bleach' has an awesome OST which will get you pumped up whenever it plays during various scenes. |Act IV| Character [9] Naturally, there is a main character and several others that are less 'flashy', but still count as important ones. As i said the main one is 'Kurosaki Ichigo' a boy who wants to protect the one he loves and as we advance we'll see that he tends to defend everyone. There are a lot of characters in 'Bleach' and I can say that they have pretty various personalities, thus it is quite interesting to watch them develop as individuals. |Act V| Enjoyment [9] Sincerely, I've had a lot of fun watching it and i still do. I recall watching it day and night because it was so intense and admirable. Believe me that there aren't people who haven't enjoyed at least an episode of 'Bleach'. There are only people who got bored of it or for whom the show didn't live up to their expectations. Try it and you'll see for yourselves. Concluding, 'Bleach is a nice shounen that you'll want to watch, especially if you are new to the anime culture.",8,Recommended,"May 24, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_01d79c8af1,12,2792
"After reading the Manga and watching the Anime like (may I say LIKE) religion itself, I have oddly mixed feelings about this franchise. The author of this manga (kubo tite) was inspired by Akira Toriyama (creator of Dragon Ball franchise in all entirety). From thereonin, you can understand the plotting, oddities, and lack of death to main/supporting protagonists throughout this story. Unlike other reviewers I refuse to hand out spoilers, but I must say this much about our carrot-topped main dude, Ichigo Kurosaki. Just like many other animes/mangas, the target audience for Bleach seems to be for pre-pubescent adolescent boys at the ripe age group of 11-14. As far as fighting and shounen go, it's all true. Our main carrot-topped ""boy"", ""man"", whatever you must call him learns only to say bankai, put on a mask to further increase his power, and over time has only learned one powerful (i'm more badass than you cuz I can make my blade shoot blackness at ya) skill! If you like shows that showcase different levels of power, almost 30 characters all with silly side stories that never seem to end, and dragonball z-like fights with NO deaths to the good guys (one exception being one of Rukia's squadmates under the 12th division who comes back LATER on in the franchise for reasons unfathomable), then this show is right for you. If you hate Dragonball Z and Naruto, then this particular franchise is the lovechild of the two monstrosities in some old, musty futon used by too many ""Pros"" that you may like. Now, about the actual story. This story involves things like life and death, and this place resembling heaven called the soul society. The theory behind this story is the cycle of life and what would happen to a human soul that experiences and exhibits sorrow, jealousy, or hatred versus those who have none of the aforementioned emotions when they pass on and how Soul Reapers (English Dubbed edition) or Shinigami (death god, or gods) deal with them in two ways. An archaic near-militaristic group called the 13 court protection squads or the Gotei 13 has ruling over the future of the Soul Society guided by Yamamamamamamamamamto Genryuusai ( I said too many mas because it would be easier to have just called the old fart YAMATO). Each squad has a well.. squad and a respective vice captain and captain, each with vastly different personalities and ambitions. Here are the pros and cons with this franchise: PROS: 1 - Character development is interesting for MOST characters and how they get involved with any calamities brought forth by Kubo. 2 - Long story that IF and only IF you're interested in big swords with near-limitless powerups that could keep you compelled. 3 - Even villains have their own complexities explained somewhat well by the author. CONS: 1 - FILLERS, FILLERS, FILLERS. This is put in because the manga progresses too slowly and has tiny-assed weekly issues only spanning 20 pages long or LESS. I'd say that a good half of the entire anime aired so far is FILLER. Who wants filler? I sure don't. My review/enjoyment of this show would be much better if the FILLER didn't exist. 2 - STOP THE 5 episode long fights already! We have seen from time to time Ichigo getting his arse handed to him in 5 minutes and him ""training"" to overcome his adversaries with unsurprisingly ease the second time around with just ONE noticeable skill (that skill being GETSUGA TENSHOU/HEAVEN-SHOCKING LUNAR FANG).. BUT please stop the 5-episode long fights! I beg of you! 3 - This franchise should've ended at least 2 years ago. The mangas themselves seem ""blah"" from time to time especially surrounding the most recent arc involving characters no one gives a rat's ass about (making reference to nearly ALL of these ""arrancar""). I would recommend this anime to anyone under the age of 18 as this seems to be the stuff only teenagers would like. It contains action, blood, mild and childish forms of treason and betrayal, and some love if any lovesick teenage boy likes the minimal levels of inserted fan service (Inoue Orihime and Rangiku Matsumoto - both bombshell blondes in the franchise). Overall, I give this anime a 7 out of 10 for all of the reasons mentioned in this review. As previously said, my thoughts/feelings on this franchise is MIXED at best.",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_26b9a6ac60,12,4283
"Overview: If you're an anime fan, or at the very least watch anime regularly, then it's more-or-less a guarantee that at some point you have at least heard of the Big Three, a term used to refer to three beloved shonen anime (""Bleach"", ""One Piece"" and ""Naruto""), called such for their extraordinarily long running times and worldwide popularity. Out of the three, the only one I have seen (and only one I intend to see) is ""Bleach"", which falls into the sub-genre of bangsian fantasy i.e. fantasies that revolve around the afterlife. While it may be far from perfect, ultimately it more than lives up to its reputation as an anime classic. Story & World (8.5/10): For as long as he can remember, 15-year-old Ichigo Kurosaki has been able to see the souls of those who have died, an ability he's not all that fond of but has learned to live with. One day, he encounters a demon that is after the soul of a young girl. Fortunately, said demon is swiftly taken care of by a mysterious girl in a black kimono. Later, he encounters the girl again in his home, and learns that her name is Rukia Kuchiki and that she's a Soul Reaper (or Shinigami, depending on what language you're watching), otherworldly beings tasked with helping souls pass on to the afterlife or Soul Society, as while most souls pass on peacefully after death, there are many that choose to stay in the World of the Living for various reasons, whether it be fear or because there's still something they have to do. Souls that take too long to pass on become one of the demons that Ichigo encountered earlier, known as Hollows, which feed off other souls and even attack humans, with it being a Soul Reaper's job to purify them and allow them to finally pass on. After a disastrous encounter with another Hollow, Rukia ends up giving her Soul Reaper powers to Ichigo, which leaves her almost powerless but allows Ichigo to become a Soul Reaper himself. Now stuck in the World of the Living until further notice, Rukia is forced to pose as an ordinary human, wearing an artificial body called a Gigai so that normal people can see her. Rukia then becomes a mentor to Ichigo so he can fill in for her until her powers come back. But to be perfectly honest, I've only scratched the surface when it comes to the story, as things only get more and more elaborate from there. The series starts off with a rather standard ""monster of the week"" format, though ""of the week"" is probably inaccurate given that even early stories tend to be two-parters at the shortest. What's more is that most of the early episodes prove to be important innocuously, with subtle developments that prove to have a pay-off in later episodes, such as certain people Ichigo and Rukia help ultimately developing powers of their own and becoming their allies. What's more is that it doesn't take long for Ichigo's endeavours to develop beyond mere Hollow-hunting, with a major event ultimately pushing him to enter the Soul Society itself, which is where the story really begins, with twists and turns a plentiful and tons of worldbuilding, with us learning more and more about Soul Reapers and their organization (known as the 13 Court Guard Squads), Hollows and another race of supernatural beings known as the Quincies, which are regarded as the opposite of Soul Reapers, on top of multiple other races that I can't say anything about without giving away major spoilers. As I said, the whole thing gets really elaborate, and will probably leave you wanting to keep watching episode after episode in order to see what happens next. However, while the series certainly starts off strongly, there are a number of parts where I felt the momentum was lost. After all, any anime that runs for a total of 366 episodes (which is practically unheard of for modern anime, if not impossible) is basically asking for trouble, and ""Bleach"" runs into that problem because of the fact that nearly a third of its episodes are anime-only. These filler arcs aren't awful per se, but they just can't measure up to the main arcs and feel completely disconnected from the main story, to the point that I wouldn't be able to blame you if you decided to just skip them entirely. Overall, the quality of the series really depends on what arc you're currently watching- when it's bad, it's mediocre and when it's good, it's amazing. Overall, the story did manage to keep me invested despite the incredibly long length of the anime, topping it all off with a very satisfying ending, though I know that it's not the end given that the final arc of the manga is currently in the middle of airing. Art & Animation (9/10): While ""Bleach""'s storytelling may vary a fair amount, the same cannot be said for its visuals. To give you an idea of how fantastic they are, the first season first aired exactly two decades ago this year, and yet it still manages to be as good-looking as some anime that only aired a few years ago, if not better-looking. The character models and environments are are very well-drawn and detailed, there are plenty of great character designs and the animations and special effects are almost consistently excellent and a sight to behold. It doesn't look flawless, with there being a number of shots where characters suddenly look very strange, but that was inevitable for such a long-running series, and these moments are ultimately infrequent enough not to make too much of an impact. Sound & Dialogue (9.5/10): ""Bleach""'s soundtrack was composed by Shiro Sagisu of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" fame, and it shows as the music is just as good as it is in that series, if not more so. Out of the openings, my favourites would be ""DtechnoLIfe"", ""Ichirin no Hana"", ""Velconica"", ""Ranbu no Melody"" and ""Harukaze"", and there are plenty of great tracks that play during the episodes, such as ""On the Precipice of Defeat"", ""Never Meant to Belong"", ""Will of the Heart"", ""Soundscape to Ardor"" and the incredibly iconic ""Number One"". The voice acting is absolutely fantastic- Johnny Yong Bosch and Michelle Ruff deliver amazing performances as Ichigo and Rukia respectively (the very roles that made them the stars they are today) and the dub has an incredible cast in general that includes Stephanie Sheh, Jamieson Price, Derek Stephen Prince, Wendee Lee, Vic Mignogna, Patrick Seitz and many more. Unfortunately, the huge number of characters means that a lot of characters end up having the same voice actor, which is very noticeable in places. Overall, however, the sound design is easily one of the show's many strengths. Characters (10/10): Despite being the protagonist of one of the Big Three, Ichigo's reputation is somewhat divisive in the anime community, with many noting that he lacks any long-term ambitions compared to other shonen heroes and claiming that this makes him less interesting by comparison. Having watched the series myself, however, I feel that this criticism is largely undeserved. Because he HAS ambition; it's just that that doesn't take the form of ""I want to create world peace."" or ""I want to become the strongest Soul Reaper."" or anything grandiose like that. No, what Ichigo wants is the power and strength necessary to protect and help as many people as he possibly can. He mentions in an early episode that he doesn't see himself as someone capable of protecting everyone in the world, and instead he's going to focus on what he can do, making him very grounded and realistic as far as shonen protagonists go. Further separating him from other shonen protagonists is that he's very intelligent and a capable student, ranking in the top 25 in his school as far as academics go as a simple result of studying hard for exams, which he does to mitigate the misconceptions he gets due to his orange hair and tendency to get into fights. In general, Ichigo is an incredibly hard worker, to the point that once he has his mind set on a goal, you can bet your very life that he'll achieve it no matter how many times he has to try (which tends to be quite a few, as he's far from invincible in a fight). As for his actual personality, he's stubborn, short-tempered and sarcastic, but there's never any doubt that he cares a lot for his friends and family. He's protective of his younger sisters especially, even believing that the oldest sibling is born first to protect all the ones that follow. He also has little respect for authority, making it clear to Rukia very early on that he'll protect people and souls because he wants to rather than because it's his duty. Throw in a very compelling backstory and character arc and I most definitely did not mind that he was on-screen for the majority of the show's runtime. But while Ichigo is certainly an amazing character in his own right, it's Rukia who really sold me on the series. She is generally just as sharp-tongued as Ichigo, but also a lot more cool-headed and far more friendly and approachable, though she does tend to play up a cutesy act to get into others' good graces. Generally, when Ichigo and Rukia share a scene together, it's almost a guarantee that they'll be bickering like a brother and sister, and it certainly helps (or doesn't help) that she's barely taller than his actual sisters. Although she loses most of her Soul Reaper powers early on, she's still fully capable of using magic (specifically, a type of magic known as kido) and can put up a defensive fight against Hollows. And when she does get her powers back, well, let's just say that it's well worth the wait, as from there she gets many more opportunities to show off how awesome she can be. Apart from being a badass, she has plenty of adorable moments as well, particularly when it comes to her serious weakness for anything cute, which made me smile and even laugh on multiple occasions. She's also very selfless and always puts the needs of her friends before her own, to the point that Ichigo feels she spends too much time worrying about other people and not enough time worrying about herself, which does prove to be a major problem in one arc, though if anything it makes for some really good character development. In short, Rukia is not only my favourite character in the series, but also one of my favourite animated characters ever. Over the course of the first arc, Ichigo and Rukia gain multiple allies that aid them over the series. Chief among these is Orihime Inoue, Ichigo's childhood friend who lives alone due to the death of her older brother several years before the story began. Personality-wise, she's best described as a pure-hearted goofball with a very overactive imagination, though she's definitely not without her moments of angst and isn't quite as cheerful as her usual demeanour would have you believe. She's also a pacifist by nature, which naturally means she tends to stay out of the fighting, since in this universe powers are fuelled by one's personality and being at peace with one's self. There's also Yasutora ""Chad"" Sado, Ichigo's half-Mexican best friend who's very similar to him in some ways and the complete opposite in others. Like Ichigo, he often gets into fights and so has a reputation as a delinquent, while also being far more intelligent than this implies (academically, he's even better than Ichigo). Unlike Ichigo, however, he rarely talks and is nothing but polite and kind to everyone he meets. In fact, his first real episode has him risking his life to save a boy he only just met (keep in mind that he doesn't even have any powers at this point) and ultimately writing it off as no big deal. He's also very much a badass who packs a mean punch, though he's sadly overshadowed by tons of other characters in the series. Finally, there's Uryu Ishida, Ichigo's first true rival and a Quincy, who as I mentioned above are the opposite of Soul Reapers- while Soul Reapers dress in dark uniforms and wield swords in combat, Quincies dress in light clothes and wield bows and arrows, which they create out of light energy. Initially having a strong hatred for Soul Reapers, Uryu naturally starts off at odds with Ichigo and attempts to prove that he's superior, though he soon mellows out and becomes one of his allies, though he'll still deny that he cares about him to his dying breath. In general, Uryu is definitely the least openly friendly member of the core cast and probably outdoes both Ichigo and Rukia when it comes to sarcasm, though he's also very chivalrous and has a soft spot for women, as well as being very good at sewing. Unfortunately, much like Chad, he proves to be no match for the strongest members of the cast, and so the chances he gets to shine (no pun intended) aren't as frequent as you would probably like. Besides these five, ""Bleach"" features an absolutely massive and diverse cast of characters, to the point that it would take a lifetime for me to go through them all. I can at least say that, as the name suggests, the 13 Court Guard Squads is made up of 13 squads of Soul Reapers, consisting of a captain, a lieutenant and several other members that get a varying degree of focus. Among these are Kenpachi Zaraki, the incredibly badass fight-loving captain of Squad 11 who I found myself loving even more than I do Ichigo, Toshiro Hitsugaya, the young captain of Squad 10 and a child prodigy, who is in some ways a male Rukia, and Renji Abarai, the lieutenant of Squad 6 and an old friend of Rukia's, who is just as hot-headed as Ichigo if not more so. Outside the 13 Court Guard Squads, there's also Kisuke Urahara, an exiled Soul Reaper who serves as a mentor to Ichigo and is probably the most intelligent character in the series, more so even than the main villain, who themself is nothing short of a mastermind. And there are so many other characters that I wish I could talk about, but can't since doing so risks giving away huge spoilers. What I really like about the series is that it generally focuses on developing the characters who matter, and doesn't waste too much time on anyone irrelevant to the story, meaning there's a big chance that someone you like will get their chance to shine. Essentially, if ""Bleach"" is worth watching for any one thing, it's the characters. Enjoyment (9.5/10): Even with the frequent filler arcs breaking up the pacing, ""Bleach"" is a series that is almost never boring, with countless action scenes to keep you invested regardless of whether you're a fan of the story that's currently being told. And where there isn't great action, chances are that there is great comedy instead. Part of what makes the series so brilliant is that its quirky, over-the-top nature means that it can make things funny in otherwise serious moments without ever killing the mood of a scene, ensuring that when things do get dark and angsty, it's never to the point of being overwhelming. Overall: ""Bleach"" is a series that requires a ton of time to get invested in, but if you overcome that significant hurdle then the pay-off is more than worth it. The worldbuilding is vast and extensive, the art and animation is almost consistently excellent, the music and voice acting are top-notch, the characters are incredible and the fights are some of the best I've ever seen. While the pacing can be very sluggish and not all episodes will be worth watching, this is still a series that more than deserves its massive popularity, and I am absolutely looking forward to seeing where the series goes next.

"Bleach is a LONG anime series. As of this moment there are 325 episodes with plenty more to come (I hope. There should be another 10-20 at the very least.). It is very difficult to write a review for this series do the expansive length and many plots combined with sub-plots and an extensive list of characters. (If you don’t want to read all the details skip to the last paragraph for a brief summary.) A good guesstimation is that at least 10%-% of the episodes are fillers. This being said, the filler episodes are completely irrelevant to the series as a whole and are not needed to be watched as there is no inherent benefit in doing so unless, you enjoy the very cheesy and generic humor thrown into these sometimes hastily put together episodes. The transition from regular episodes to filler episodes can also be somewhat abrupt at times leaving you wondering what just happened. Ignoring all the filler episodes, the story line is rather creative and divided into several events that occur in succession. Throughout the several main plots multiple sub-plots come about giving background information and history about many of the characters in the show. The sub-plots sometimes even lead into additional sub-plots. It can be somewhat confusing at times due to the massive amount of plots occurring at once but the complexity gives it a depth that is much deeper than many other series. The characters in Bleach are numerous and it can be hard to keep track of who is part of what group and especially their names. The group of main characters consists of five persons while on the other hand there are roughly 50 or more supporting characters. Character development and progression is relatively profound and meaningful. This specifically stands out as the characters discover new power locked within themselves. Complex relationships are also formed throughout the shows progression as well as old relationships revealed. All of this further helps to fuel the plot of Bleach, adding layer upon layer to an already complex plot. The animation of Bleach is very nicely done with some starkly contrasting art used in the fight scenes and humorous moments to provide an entirely different feel from the rest of the show. The sound as a whole is well conceived and defined; it is often used to help further amplify and highlight specific scenes throughout the series. There can be some significant differences between what is said in the subbed version versus the dubbed version, even though the meaning might be the same, how the words are emphasized can be quite contrasting. The voice acting is well done in both versions regardless of what people say about the dubbed version’s voice acting being “horrible”. (Personally I recommend the subbed version due to the difference in wording, not because of the voice acting.) Bleach is a long yet exciting anime series with a deep, rich plot and extensive character development. Animation, art style, and sound effect/music are key elements used to enhance specific situations throughout the series and are well calculated. Bleach has some magnificent fight scenes, some of the best made in any anime. If your attention span is shorter or do not care for the filler episodes I would suggest skipping them, doing so will not amount to any loss of the plot. I would suggest choosing to watch the subbed version of the series due to wording differences in some cases. Bleach is a solid mainstream anime series that is easy to get into and provides for good entertainment. I would recommend this series to anybody whether they have been watching anime for a long time or just getting into it.",8,Recommended,"Jun 13, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b8cabfe679,12,3640
"Bleach! one of the big 3 shounen manga (along with Naruto and One piece). Bleach deserve its popularity. It has a good plot. The characters are great and has sense of humor but turn to bad ass people when it comes to fight and protect their nakamas. The art is also beautiful and you'll really enjoy watching it. Although fillers are there, you can still burst to laughter and enjoy the fights upon watching it.

"Bleach started off good but after the Soul Society Arc it quickly turned terrible. It took me a good few episodes to get into Bleach but before I knew it, It was 4am and I had watched over 50 episodes! I thought that Bleach would become one of my Top 10 anime. I was sadly mistaken. Ichigo was awesome at the end of the Soul Society Arc but after that, he became totally powerless after that. There are 4 reasons why it didn't get a lower score. 1) The Soul Society Arc 2) Lirin/Ririn 3) The hollow form of Ichigo when he annihilated Ulquiorra and 4) Visored.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 18, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d0a1ad4145,12,559
"I love it and the characters, but the final season (if it was so important) could have been done SO much better. The ending seemed rushed but overall it gave you that satisfied feeling knowing Ichigo could live happily fighting with his friends and what he did with Ginjo was ridiculously admirable. Good ending but, again, it would have been better if they finished off stronger. Other than that, LOVE Aizen; he was THE villain, dispicable, suave, genious, and cool-headed. I know others hate him for the stuff he's done (and rabid-fangirls love him for his looks) but all-in-all he's a well-though out character. My only shipping-worthy parring for this anime (though their are many) is UlquiHime. They are MADE for each other; a sad ending yes but that is what makes it all the more worth it. fleeting love is better than beating a dead horse over and over again.

"Bleach is definitely apart of the grand trinity that hit the states when I was growing up (Naruto, One Piece and Bleach). I started watching as a child on adult swim, and my interest in the show dissipated as time went on, I don't believe that is because of the show itself, but because I was too young to really enjoy everything that went on. One of my complaints about the anime is that there are a lot of fillers, I don't believe as many as Naruto & Shippuden, but there are plenty of things that happen in the anime that just don't occur in the manga. I definitely recommend watching the anime BEFORE reading the manga. Another thing is the manga tends to be alot more graphic and less fan fare? There are random spurts of comedic relief, but a lot of people you wish you could have gotten to know better DIE. Also, the only way you could even finish Bleach at this point is if you were to read the manga. In a way I hope that there are more episodes of Bleach, and that the ending of the anime expands on the ending in the manga, but there really is no relief in the end. The anime leaves you at this arc that really feels strange in the way that it feels like it was rushed and tossed at you, but the manga does this at times too especially in the final arc. Overall, I loved Bleach and I appreciate the wisdom it offered, especially in regard to friendship and love. Ideally, I would like to see more from Tite Kubo, I don't think Bleach is over. I think that if you consider the ending of the anime and the manga, it doesn't feel over. I hope that in time after Kubo takes a long rest, he comes back and pushes for more, both for the anime and manga. Some minor advice: SKIP the fillers and watch them at the end. They are really time consuming and while they offer you little details on minor characters, some of those characters don't even truly exist. AT ALL. So just save yourself the time and watch the anime's true storyline first, my best advice is to stray from looking anything up until you read the final arc in the manga. I started where I had left off in the show and immediately got through it in like 24 hours. Good luck!",9,Recommended,"Apr 6, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4386956b35,13,2143
"To be honest, many moments are quite predictable now due to the fact that a part of the script twists have already been overused and something has already become outdated, so of this it may seem childish in places, but they are still well placed and mostly it's not boring to watch (although sometimes it is) - btw the arc with the Soul Society just one of the best ✨. Such a thing is present in many titles of that time (the same One Piece or Naruto), while others do not stand still and move at a frantic pace according to trends and the viewer. If you new to this, then go ahead, it's rel cool. If you are already a fan of the genre, you will guess some twists. However, the ideas and characters are still interesting and fascinating, which proves that the title is unusual and popular for a reason, especially closer to the final arcs, so it is worth watching (I skipped the fillers, but someone might like them, they look pretty💅) A separate like for the sound (a mix of flamenco + sword fights is brilliant🤯)",9,Recommended,"Sep 11, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_17c20bb57a,13,1014

"Bleach is actually worth a try, regardless of the loads of episodes it provides. *Just skip all the useless fillers* Story: The concept is fairly unique. Ichigo gains powers of the soulreapers & has to defend humanity from evil spirits. Sounds easy to follow, but they make it interesting as the story continues on. The fillers are useless and a waste of time. Though they provide some future characters for the ""actual"" episodes that don't actually exist in the manga. I skipped all the fillers and could still follow the story. Art/Sound: Art is Average / Sound is Pretty Good. Some openings/endings are catchy. Character: Ichigo is a short-tempered & impulsive guy. He plays off to be the ""cool"" guy and gets caught up in fights at times. You are bound to like him because he speaks his mind and doesn't give in. Enjoyment: I have to say, most of the episodes end with cliffhangers, and make you want to see what happens next. So, I enjoyed going from ep to ep to see what happens lol.

"While I will admit there are flaws in the show, I still enjoy the show a lot. At first, I really didn't like it a lot, but when I got to the Soul Society arc, I loved it. The other arcs may not be as good as the Soul Society, they were still great as well (I'm glad they still kept going after Soul Society). So let's review all of the aspects of Bleach Story: Bleach's story is quite...weak. Mostly the beginning was hollow slaying, Soul Society was saving Rukia, Hueco Mundo was saving Orihime, and such. Now some arcs (had some decent storytelling in some filler arcs though). But still, compared to most anime with great storytelling (like Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 and Brotherhood, Naruto, Rurouni Kenshin, etc), Bleach is rather poor in this category. 5/10 (Ok, but could've been better) Art: One of my favorite things about Bleach is the art work. It's so gorgeous and beautiful. All you need to do is watch Shunsui vs Starrk, Ichigo vs Byakuya, and Ichigo vs Grimmjow (all 3 fights) and you'll understand what I'm talking about. Bleach does a great job at showing destruction and drawing it's characters. Although there are animation problems in the show, but the good still outweighs the bad 9/10 (Great art work) Sound: 3 categories Music: Amazing. What makes Bleach's music very unique is how it goes from very intense and badass (Storm Center, Power To Strive, and Battle Ignition), creepy and mysterious (Whisper of the Apocolypse, Creeping Shadows, and Torn Apart), funny (Comedical World and Dodo Dance), sad (Soundscape To Ardor, Will Of The Heart, Never Meant To Belong), and also incorporates Spanish themes for the Espada, which is something that's quite unique since most anime shows mostly have English like music 10/10 (Fantastic) Voice Acting: Great. While I will admit the voice acting can sound a bit forced (Ichigo's voice acting mostly) as well as the lines they say, the voice acting is amazing. The dub VAs perfectly go along with their roles (Kariya, Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Hollow Ichigo, Aizen, Dordoni, Kenpachi, Coyote Starrk etc). 9/10 (Great but most voice acting can be quite annoying and corny at times) Sound Effects: Sound effects are pretty solid, my favorite sound effects are mostly the Hollow like/distorted effects when Ichigo is hollowfied and talking) 9/10 (nothing much to say about the sound effects) Characters: This is where Bleach shines greatly at. I really enjoy almost every character in the show. From characters like Ichigo, Renji, Grimmjow, Rukia, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ikkaku, Uryu, Hollow Ichigo, Aizen, and Starrk. And that's only 10, as there are more characters I very much enjoy. I also like how they give depth to so many characters to make them very likable and amazing in their own way, as well as go into their pasts more (and show them doing normal things and have interesting interactions with each other, another thing I like about Bleach's fillers). 9.5/10 (would be a 10 if they gave more depth to Chad and Orihime, but I don't blame Bleach, since they fleshed out a lot of characters.) However, that doesn't mean there aren't flaws to this show. One of the flaws would be the power scaling, especially when it comes to the captains (or mainly Byakuya, Kenpachi, or Hitsugaya), who get powerful without much explanation (especially since they shouldn't get stronger in such a short amount of time as they've trained for centuries, aside from RG training) and hog most of the spotlight . Another thing is sometimes of how things go and like I stated earlier, the plot. They do come off as poor compared to most anime shows. However, like I said, the good outweigh the bad. Overall and Enjoyment: 9/10 Conclusion: Bleach may not be perfect, as it does tend to come off as corny and annoying, but when it comes to well executing the concepts of Soul Reapers and fleshing out the characters, Bleach does not fail to disappoint. Definitely worth your time if you're a fan of shounen",9,Recommended,"Oct 9, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b8a83d060d,13,3943
"It took me quite a while to finish everything of Bleach, but my hasn't been wasted. Story (10) : The base of the story is very interesting and well thought. No wonder it is one of the most famous shonen anime. We have heard/seen/read stories about Shinigali (soul reapers) but not like this one. It is a very long anime, yes, but all apsects are being well developped and thought of. It is a shame though, that how further you go, how more fillers you will get. There are some good fillers, but sometimes you just want to continue with the main arcs. But like the movies (yes, there are 4 movies), you can easily skip them, and it doesn't influence the story at all, and watch the fillers later on. Art (10/8) : At a certain point, the artstyle changes. Probably the anime has been put on hild for a while and then continued again, but with another artist. The first artstyle, is like the one the manga. It is unique and totally fitst the theme of the anime. It is also the typical artstyle for a shonen. The second artstyle is not bad either, but I didn't like it as much as the first one. The scond one is more of a general anime artstyle wth elements of the first one. Don't know if you see what I mean, but just remember, the art changes, it's normal. The first one was better. Warning : expect girls with big boobs. Sound (10) : The soundtracks used in Bleach are very nice. There are many different soundtracks, and even so, often they take the originals and arrange them differently to fit the scene of the anime. The soundtracks don't use always the same genre or instruments so you won't get bored from it. Character (10) : There are maaaaany characters, too many to all remember there names. But the good thing is, is that all characters have been differentiated with several traits; not only their hair, but also their personalities are diverse. Sometimes the characters can be a bit ""surprising"" with what they say or how they act. So you never really get bored of them. Enjoyement (9) : The humor is nice, and is presented in a nice and light way. I'm not always laughing my ass of, but it is enjoyable. After a while you might get bored of those ""typical"" jokes, but they producer manages to alternate it with some more serious scene and then hitting you in the face with a some sudden humour. Some romance, here and there, but it is not major. Also at the end of every episode there is a small original skit, really recommend to NOT skip those!! Overall (9.5) : Great action anime. A lot of battles (ofc), but if you like that kind of things mingled with some comedy and supernatural stuff, I recommend you to go watch Bleach. I know, it's long, but addicting (in my case). Just take your time watching it to fully enjoy it.",9,Recommended,"Feb 15, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_025836bb60,13,2739
"In Bleach it is about student Ichigo Kurosaki, who can see ghosts. One day, his family comes to a severe hardship and he meets the Shinigami Rukia Kushiki, who has won the Soul Society. She tells Ichigo that the evil spirit that just attacks Ichigo's family is a so-called Hollow. Ichigo can no longer wait and storms toward the Hollow to save his family. In the last second, Rukia protects himself so that he can not be eaten. Ichigo then goes to Rukia, where Rukia transfers her Shinigamik forces to Ichigo to protect his family. The anime has a lot of tension and is very well built by the story. Even on good characters is not lacking, on the contrary: I find that even all Fillercharaktere have been well designed!

"Story: 8/10 It's a cliché battle Shounen anime plot, but if you like those type of anime you'll love this. The only bad thing about this anime is the ridiculous amount of filler, I think about half of the anime is filler and the bad part is that the anime makes part of the filler arcs into canon so you're kind of forced to watch them. Although, if you just ignore the trashy filler it'll be a 10/10 so yeah there's that. Art: 9/10 Not much to say good art for the time it was released except maybe the first episodes for some reason they had horrible animation even for the time they were released, but nothing too bad. Sound: 10/10 One of the best anime OST in my opinion gets you pumped up too watch them fight and see Ichigo grow stronger or fall into despair. Character: 10/10 Cliché character development of growing stronger and prevailing through almost unbeatable enemies, but I love that cliché ass stuff so 10/10 for me. Enjoyment: 8/10 Hated the first few eps, but then I got hooked again the filler kinds of ruin, but also again you can just ignore it so yeah.

"This review is based on all the episodes of Bleach that have been released so far (366). A lot of people seem to say that Bleach doesn't have a very in depth story but honestly when you compare where the show is at at episode 300 compared to episode 1 it is one of the furthest developments of a storyline I have ever seen. The main arcs are highly enjoyable and setup the fight scenes brilliantly. The only thing that lets Bleach's storyline down is the fact that this show is so jam-packed with filler episodes. I know you can just skip fillers and what not but I am a bit of a completionist and like to watch a show in it's entirety, so these were a huge slog to get through for me. Even if I wasn't a completionist I would still think it proper to take the fillers into consideration as they are a part of the show's episode list (unfortunately). The art style is brilliant in this show, from the way the characters are designed and drawn, to the action choreography, to how the comedic scenes are delivered, you can hardly fault this show for it's exciting visuals. I absolutely love the audio in this show, they have a variety from heavy beats to more higher-pitched fast tempo tracks. They sound fantastic and the music in this show never fails at getting you pumped to see someone power up or a fight break out. The characters in this show are amazing in their design and are mostly interesting. The only things I can fault regarding the characters is some of their powers are sometimes a little bit dumb (for lack of a better word) and sometimes it simply doesn't make sense how one character who just lost a fight to someone goes and beats someone who just beat the person they lost to originally. The show is a little inconsistent with it's characters power levels. Both of these factors are easily overlooked though as for the most part the characters are brilliant. I love Bleach and while it isn't a perfect anime (due to the reasons I've mentioned) it rarely failed to entertain me and all of the main story arcs and characters were an absolute blast.",8,Recommended,"May 5, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_13e593982f,13,2066

"""Losing track of what you want to protect"" That's the feeling you get when you really get into this anime. At first I was hesitant to watch this anime because it didn't look that appealing to me as I'm sure that also applies to some of you who are currently wondering whether or not to give this anime a try. A typical shounen anime?...maybe, maybe not. Bleach has been compared to many anime of the years; Naruto, One Piece, heck even Dragon Ball. The question is why? Is it of that caliber? Is it overrated? These are questions youa re surely questioning in your mind. In my opinion it is slightly overrated. There are episodes where you are on the edge of your seat but also there are those where you would rather take a dump. The main problem is that not each episode is breathtaking. I'm not saying that it has to be all action and stuff. It's just that the suspense is not always there. A boy gains supernatural powers to save a girl then...that's it. The story takes an entirely different turn. Not to say that, that is a bad thing. It's interesting in its own way. For some of you it might be even better than the first arc. Now for the main reason for this animes ""downfall"" is...fillers. This anime consists of 1/3 manga and 2/3 crap. Now I haven't read the manga so analysis could be slightly off but not by much. Bleach has rapidly caught up with its manga which is the main cause for the fillers. Some of them are entertaining, others are plain miserable. For the producers to go so far it only shows how popular the manga is. In my opinion the anime is worth the fillers because despite the cons the pros are much better. The boy Kurosaki Ichigo matures both mentally and physically throughout the course of the anime (mainly mentally). His powers grow whilst discovering new ones. He makes new friends as well as foes. Luckily he is not the type who hates violence or hates killing, otherwise I would have dropped this anime years ago. At first the plot is very interesting and engaging but it goes down south after that, due to fillers. Nevertheless it still keeps you entertained and that is the most important thing. Don't contemplate whether or not this anime is a waste of time because that is definitely not the case. Some will say that this anime is ""shit"" and all that bust they are obviously exaggerating. Those are people who either didn't bother to watch the first few episodes or didn't like the anime from the start. Trust me! No one will say horrible things about this anime if they even remotely enjoy it from the start. Others are wondering how much longer will this anime go for. My guess is until the manga ends...You just went OMG didn't you. Yes this anime will still go on for at least another few years since the manga isn't close to finishing...I think. There is a certain amount of violence and blood but not to the extent where you would label this anime gore (bloodshed). People fending for their life with swords. That's the gist. Story wise, it isn't great but it isn't bad either. You would enjoy this if you like action, whether or not you enjoy the story. There is no strong romance only minor hints so I wouldn't recommend it those who are looking for a dramatic anime. There has been much speculation about couples emerging due to how much time they spend together. They so far, are just rumors so again don't expect anything special to happen. The funny thing is each character that is introduced, it is hard to forget them. They are so unique that they always stay with you. That's how it is for me at least. Maybe it's the art. The style is appealing and it improves as it progresses. That's what I really enjoy. Watching the art/drawing improve over the years. It makes my feel like I'm a part of it. Overall you should definitely at least give this anime a try. Don't say no before you give it a go. That's what I did and look where I a, now, 333 episodes and still going. Even if you end up not liking it you will not regret watching it. My life, my review, my conclusion. Live your life to the fullest by taking any opportunity you can.

"Ah Bleach , one of the big three animes that people are sure to know of or get exposed to . I felt that I had to write this review as Bleach was the first anime that got me watching other anime ( silly me ) . Okay , now for the review itself . This anime , has it's pros and cons . The anime started off with an interesting plot and this made me watch one season per day that was until the bount arc which was so dull , it killed me off and made me seriously reconsider dropping the series . But over time , the plot was like a roller coaster ride , going up and reaching its peak at Aizen's arc and then deteriorating after . As for the art , the anime started off with mediocre or even , bad art style but as it progresses on , it gets better and better so it's not much of a problem . The sound , however , is great ( an understatement ) as they have awesome soundtracks when an enemy is faced , a hollow appears and so on , not forgetting the theme songs which are sure to leave an impact to the audience . The character development is bad as there are just way too many characters and not only that , the anime focuses mostly on the main characters ( Ichigo , Inoue , Chad , Ishida , Rukia ) . This neglects the other characters ( Captains , Vice-Captains , etc ) . One example is when Ulqiourra dies , I didn't even know how to feel as Ulqiourra barely had any screen time and then bam , he's dead . I did enjoy watching this anime initially but as it progresses , it started to get repetitive and when I was at the final arc , I was thinking when will it end which never occurred to me when I was watching it before . But this is covered up by the awesome fight scenes backed up by the beastly background music . Overall , this anime deserves a 6 as it starts to be repetitive and lack character development but since it started off with a bang and has great soundtrack , I decided to give it a 6 .",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 13, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e8723a41fa,13,1905
"I have been associated with bleach for over a decade now and have witnessed its fall over the time. Like many bleach fans I tried to defend it for the longest time but I think it's time to be honest. Bleach came with a wave of freshness, a youth driven shounen with beautiful artwork and refreshing style. This can be witnessed up to soul society arc. If I had to rate only up to SS arc, I would give it a solid 9. But the problem begins afterwards. Story: The most unoriginal story you can ever find in a shounen. I can understand why bleach became a hit in SS arc, but I don't understand why anyone would like it afterwards. The story literally repeats itself in HM arc right down to the gags. It is so blatant that for the longest time people kept searching for any symbolism in repeating the same story like some kind of parallel opposite, but there is none. It is just a really bad story telling. At least in SS arc Rukia was taken away by force for reasons beyond her control. HM arc is so stupid because instead of asking for help, Orihime basically walks into enemy's palms by herself and not only that she acts surprised when these guys come to save her. I kid you not. The girl is that stupid, and it doesn't help she is one of the main characters with so much focus given to her considering she is practically useless and impossible to bear. Kubo's obsession with this poorly developed Character and a really bad characterization of female over all has been one of the major sore points about bleach. I don't see how any anime can recover from the stupidity of practically repeating same story it already told for years so bleach never really does get better after SS arc. It's pointless fight after fight which are so boring because people stand around explaining their powers while the enemy just listens. Wtf? I recommend watch it till SS arc then drop it. If you're interested in HM arc just look for episodes where there is Grimmjow vs Ichigo and Ulquiorra vs Ichigo specifically, these are the only two fights worth even noting. The ultimate boss battle was hyped so much but fell flat on its face, it wasn't entertaining at all. They turned Aizen into a joke. Be warned, there will be random asspull power ups in every fight. Characters There are some interesting characters like Rukia, Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Unohana, Byakuya, Tatsuki but over all its just so many characters with such littler development it is almost a crime why this anime is even popular. The MC Ichigo kurosaki is the blandest protagonist I have ever come across. He can hardly do anything by himself yet he is so full of himself for no reason. He has no life goals besides going from point a to b due to whatever is happening right now and be swept in random fights. SS arc started with Ichigo's wish to protect Rukia who gave him a new life and powers, and in turn protect his friends as well who went with him to SS. This was fine for one arc but as Ichigo grows in age and physically, he mentally doesn't grow at all. There is no maturity of thought process, no character development nothing. Even till the end of anime he still has no goals besides ""protect friends"", the same friends he very conveniently puts down often whenever it suits him. Protecting friends (which is just 3 people in human world so to say since he has lost touch with everyone else) is something that can be byproduct of achieving your goal, it's not something that can make an interesting narrative for a hero's journey. Among the mains Byakuya and Rukia seem to be the only somewhat loveable characters but they, specially Rukia, have been shafted so bad it's not even worth talking about. After a while the characters also all start to look the same. The arrangers were made to be such huge deals but in the end turned out total sissies. Also the villain, god modding Aizen is the blandest character ever too. He is constantly shown as the super powered ultimate opponent but very little exploration is done into his life, his goals and what drives him. His powers, his past, his childhood, his bonds, family, his motivators..m none of that is revealed. Which just makes him a card board cutout with no personality to be honest. In SS arc he made very solid debut tbh and I thought Kubo will create something amazing out of him, but alas wasted potential. In fact poor character development and wasted potential is the very theme of bleach. Fights Since bleach is so famous for fights, let's talk about them shall we? The fights are utterly lame. They lack logic and come across as stupid most of the times. Like how the enemy just stands there doing nothing while the good guys interact with each other and make a plan. Or how everyone spends half of the episode explaining all of their power instead of fighting which is utterly stupid, why would you help your enemy in figuring out your powers? Or like how everyone starts the fight with just smashing their unreleased swords together and keeps going on and on like that when both parties know neither will win unless their unleash their full power. Or like how ex captain class attack final boss without bankai or shikai and get their butt kicked in 0.2 seconds despite knowing enemy strength. Or how the hero can never get anything done at all without a last minute power up which becomes useless by next fight so he needs another power up. Or how no one ever dies in this manga except the bad guys and they get resurrected over and over so the whole concept of death is completely useless in bleach universe. I could go on for days to be honest but I think the other reviews summed up the other points I left. I can't believe there was a time I actually believed bleach will continue to be awesome forever. I tried to keep my hope during HM arc but it never really did get better after SS arc. full bringer arc wasn't even worth talking about because it was just a filler ass pull arc centred around having an excuse to give Ichigo his powers back, which makes all the drama over him losing powers kind of pointless. Final verdict: I would recommend bleach up to soul society arc. After that don't bother if you value your time and intelligence.",3,Not Recommended,"Nov 29, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_75d8d2bc36,13,6171
"I wasn't going to watch this. I mean, I got into anime not long ago and just the sheer number of episodes scared me off of that one. So I ignored it. It wasn't until recently, maybe a month ago, that Bleach got my attention. Ok, then. I'll try this out, and just stop when it gets boring (estimating 50 episodes or so) - were my thoughts. Yeah, right. Finished now, though I did skip all of the fillers while going through the main story-line. When that was finished, I got back to them, but still only Zanpakutou and Invading army arcs have been interesting enough to see through. With this in mind and also the fact that I haven't even seen the manga until after the episode 363, this is my review. So, the Story. I'd say 7/10 because while it kept my interest till the end, sometimes it felt repetitive. When you start watching you can be constantly surprised by this and that, but as the time goes you mostly can guess what's gonna happen. It didn't turn me off, but made me fast forward some of the scenes. The whole concept is probably nothing new, but the fact doesn't make it less enjoyable. Sure you can say that it's cheesy, but it is a fantasy world, isn't it? It wouldn't be right without romantic heroes and evil overlords. Art. 8/10. I don't know anything about whether the animation was good, or how well the action scenes were executed, but I liked it. The character design was a little awkward in the beginning, but it progressed nicely. Sound. That's purely subjective. The Op's and Ed's were not to my taste. The OST was mostly spot on, but there were some moments that made me want to plug my ears. So, IMO 7/10, but it depend's on taste. Characters. That's probably the best part of the anime. It was probably the first series that didn't have even one character that was really irritating. Well, Orihime, almost got that one, but not entirely. She still had her good points and got annoying mostly closer to the end. Ichigo is Mary Sue (or her male counterpart, whatever), but he's still sweet. Not sure what makes him so, but even him always being the one to save the day, doesn't make Mr. Strawberry any less likable. The great part is how step by step we get a glimpse into the world of every character, getting to know and better understand their actions, to see how they become what they are now. And after that see them develop with every step they take. It did get annoying sometimes, because it really is each and every character, but was interesting anyway. Overall? That was great and I already want to start over (probably gonna read the manga to quench that thirst). It is sad that Bleach has ended, but it's also good to know when is the right time to go and not to drag something out just because. I loved the finale - it was lighthearted and bright, with a little sadness. Just what every story needs.",7,Recommended,"Apr 1, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b7e651e5ed,13,2838
"Bleach is the perfect name because watching this is bleach to my eyes. It takes the worst anime practices and doesn't make up for them. There's a ton of filler and stare-offs. A sword swing will take ages. Characters will just sit there and stare, saying nothing. Chad is the best character by virtue of shutting his hole while others yap for hours. Nothing was entertaining. The story was a complete snoozefest. The characters vary from lame to passable. The animation is dogshit. There are no cool concepts like a creative power system or setting. It is very telling that the best moment in Bleach, which its fans will never stop talking about, is a villain stopping the protagonist's sword (and theme song) with two fingers. Okay? You realize the author can write anything he wants right? He can write that the villain stops the sword with his eyeball if he wants to. Why do I give a shit about how arbitrarily strong a fictional character is? A friend once tried to re-introduce me to Bleach by showing me an episode from the latest season. The animation and coloring was amazing. However, the same problems from the original Bleach continued onwards. Characters sit there and yap during fights, making 4 sword swings last an entire episode. They talk about important things like how much stronger they are instead of just showing it. If you're not into powerscaling (arguing about which fictional character is arbitrarily stronger), there's no point in watching Bleach.",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2594ce654a,13,1474
"This show reminded me of the TV series _Heroes_, it started off decent, but after Soul Society Arc it went downhill, and the last arc was like Season 4 of _Heroes_. For some generalization of my taste: Gintama>One Piece>Hunter x Hunter>Hit-men Reborn>.................Bleach>Fairy Tail>Naruto. For the story, there was not much of one. Ichigo reluctantly became a Soul Reaper through some special circumstance, but did not have much of a goal. Then it turned into ""save the princes""' for several different arcs. I am not sure what happened to the last arc, but some of the filler arcs are better. The characters, I liked a few of them, but there were too many to actually have a focus on. If there was, it was at the sacrifice of the MC's screen time. Surprisingly enough, the one character that I disliked was the MC himself. Ichigo starts off as a badass, fights, then makes a shocked face at his enemies power, then loses his resolve, Sometimes, he somehow miraculously escapes his enemies clutches, then trains in-between an event. He loses his resolve so many times, I forgot to count, once or twice would have been alright, but then it became annoying. This should not be spoiler, because it is rare for the MC to be killed off, especially early in the series. Ichigo is a zombie, he literally gets killed three or four times, and somehow comes back from the dead each time. Also, other characters that should be on the verge of dead, somehow gain a power-up, and fight like their injuries are non-existent. It happens several times in one fight, this series takes plot armor to the next level. The saddest part of this series is that it had great potential with a lot of characters, but it failed.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 9, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_22d07bf759,13,1704
"Is watching the original Bleach so you can watch the new, much appraised, seasons worth it? That's what I did and here is what you are looking at if you plan on doing the same. Plot: 4/10 As a short summary: Ichingo Kurosaki is thrust in the world of hunting bad ghosts called Hollows and as the story advances evil plots are uncovered and his job becomes saving the world - more or less. The story has a promising start, but the writing direction is plain bad as it's too focused on the action battles. The basic plot is not bad but the story just fizzles along the way. The main problem is that the anime has too many ""important"" characters it wanted to show the power abilities of. And by too many I mean there are at least 20 characters whose fights we have to witness before we learn even the tinies bit of information about someone's backstory, motivations or aspirations. In the second arc, there are around 35 episodes of pure fights before we learn any information about why things are happening the way they are. I understand fights are the staple of shonen but even according to the mid-2000s standards the battles remain under average. It’s a parade of people you barely know duking it out for what feels like an eternity. There’s no choreography, no strategy, no teamwork—just flashy attacks and lots of yelling. Forget clever power combos or strategic thinking. Nope, in Bleach, it's all about brute force. And for some reason, everyone fights one-on-one like it’s an unspoken rule of the Soul Reaper universe. Teamwork? Who needs it when you can shout out the name of your attack and hope for the best, right? At least there is none of that ""power of friendship"" victories. The fact that the power system itself is never fully explained (in the canon episodes at least) just adds to the confusion. Especially since the anime introduces new and unexplained power systems all the time. The last arc makes absolutely no sense, clearly, nothing screams ""solid writing"" like reworking your universe’s rules in the last episodes! And speaking of dragging things out: subplots appear, disappear, and reappear when you’ve almost forgotten they existed. This isn’t so much of a series as it is an obstacle course where the obstacles are your brain cells trying to keep up. These many fights also put a damper on the time given to character development. Characters: 6/10 The main and supporting characters in Bleach start off with solid foundations and interesting dynamics—emotional characters paired with more logical ones, which is fun to watch and there are some unique characters worth watching. But character development moves slowly, and the timeline for when we learn more about them is chaotic. We are left confused by some characters' choices, betrayals or sacrifices because the show didn't explain in a timely manner their inner feelings and history. Even the MC doesn't actually have any tangible and intricate objective or ambition. He just wants to get stronger to protect people. There is no justification about why he would go through so much trouble, no goals, except for ""that's who he is"", which is a bit lacking. If we take another important character, Inoue, supposedly the most powerful healer who could potentially rewrite reality—yet, she spends the entire series being annoyingly useless. Her main role is standing on the sidelines, sobbing dramatically, worsening the situation for everyone and then maybe throwing a shield here or there like a confused Pokemon. It’s almost impressive how she manages to do so little with so much potential. Also, most of the female characters, not all, are often damsels in need of protection. The characters' development is also hindered by one of my biggest pet peeve in anime...comic relief gimmicks. If you think you’ll get a break from the action with some deep, heartfelt conversations—think again. The show insists on inserting ridiculous comic relief into even the most serious moments. A character could be on the brink of an emotional revelation and another one will roll in with a tasteless joke or a physical punch to interrupt it. Then we have the villains, who are more focused on giving long, dramatic monologues and twirling their metaphorical mustaches than actually using their absurdly overpowered abilities to wipe out the heroes. Their development makes no sense either, and by the time they do anything, you’ve already stopped caring. Art 7/10: The design of the characters is impressive especially given the variety of characters. They each have stylish outfits and powers to go with it. The art of the swords and their evolution is creative and beautiful. The animation itself is good considering the period the anime aired. Enjoyment: 4/10 Even if the show drags on and on, I can't say I am completely indifferent by it and it did crack me a smile from time to time. OVERALL: Bleach crumbled under eight of it's own ambition, taking it - and us - all over the place. The early episodes are fun, with an interesting concept and cool designs but it doesn't make up for the lack of emotional development of characters that progress every 50 episodes. Without getting into a review of the new seasons, I think it's worth watching the original Bleach if you are a patient person really into fights. 5/10. I just can't bring myself to give more to the execution of the anime seeing how it is either confusing or boring most of the time. But hey, at least the swords are cool, right?",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 20, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4ac7512f9d,13,5468
"Bleach is not a good show and I’m tired of people saying it is. It was so hard to follow just because of how boring it is. Plus over 150 episodes of filler is crazy, I’m glad they stopped making it for over 10 years because it is so bad. The only reason I made it through the whole thing was to say I’ve watched the whole big 3. Don’t even get me started on Aizens dimension (I don’t really care what it’s called) with those two annoying hollows with the green haired skull baby.

"At the beginning for some reason I always put off bleach because most of the ratings said the story wasn't too great. And all the ratings did ZERO justice to just what a masterpiece this anime is. I'd say out of the big three bleach definitely has the potential to be the best. I haven't watched one piece so I can't say much but in comparison to naruto bleach is miles ahead. To begin with the story is just absolutely fantastic. Its at a much faster pace than naruto and the stroy overall has much more dept. Ichigo is actually portrayed as a normal teenager who isn't too happy or outgoing yet he always cares about those he loves and will do anything to save them. The story really picks up from the soul society and just gets better from then on. And for those of you who complain about the fillers, come on guys we live in a time and age where a filler list can literally be used to skip them out. Bleach also has fantastic openings, endings and literally the best osts in comparison to any anime I have watched. It also had amazing art style the characters are super unique and each character has depth. Unlike most shounen anime bleach actually has useful female characters and they are portrayed so well especially rangiku and yoruichi. The fights are also really good and once again I think they're far better than naruto in terms of villains too. Overall I'd say please give it a chance the storyline is the most unpredictable one and it certainly is one of the best. I'd say it's almost as good as fmab story wise.",10,Recommended,"Aug 22, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_654c1b7046,14,1526

"(Spoiler Free) a Action Comedy anime with serious moments in the mix ,remind me of GINTAMA, its a series that starts without any lag imo, huge sets of characters nice music, fights, animation, action. there are lots of things that can nitpicked like illogical power ups or coincidences for plot but since its a long series and i have only watched 63 yet i will enjoy without being a crybaby about it. **The Soul Society arc: (sidenote, yoruichi best girl and ichigoat) in Bleach is an exciting ride with a great story, but it has its quirks. The stakes are high, the fights are cool, and you really get a sense of growth for Ichigo and his friends as well as the new characters introduced However, there are a few things that throw me off a lil bit. First, there's a lot of talking. Every attack seems to come with a mini-lecture, and while it's nice to know the reasoning behind each move, it can get a little much. Instead of keeping up the action, some fights lose momentum with these detailed explanations, which feels repetitive. Plus, the humor doesn't always land. Even in life-or-death moments, characters sometimes goof around or crack jokes, which can feel off when the situation should be intense. Then, there’s the hype around certain fights. Some of the big battles don’t quite live up to expectations, and the power levels aren’t very consistent, especially when comparing Ichigo to the captains or comparing among captains . It’s hard to know just how strong each character actually is, which messes with the excitement. And on top of that, a few scenes where characters could’ve stayed down for real emotional impact end up with easy ""resurrections,"" making sacrifices feel less significant. All that said, it still has an awesome story that draws you into the world and sets up the series for more action. The friendships, the training, and the core plot are strong, making it a worthwhile watch—even if it has a few bumps along the way.",8,Recommended,"Oct 31, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_31d883b302,14,1954

"Bleach. For those of you who have not seen Bleach, go watch it. Now. Or at least read it. (Since the manga is much better than the anime and is still continuing.) I know that for reviews, you shouldn't write a story summary, but I feel I can't write a review without it. Bleach is basically about Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15-year-old boy who can see ghosts. One day, he encounters Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami/soul reaper when his family is being attacked by a lost soul known as a Hollow. In order to protect his family, Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper/shinigami and from then on is pulled into the insane world of the supernatural. I admit that Bleach began rather slow, and some episodes were rather boring...That is until the second season when everything begins to heat up. Bleach has a very great plotline...UNTIL the Fullbring arc. I admit, I do like the FullBring arc, but it seemed more like I was reading a fanfiction when I read it. (I haven't watched it yet.) It was a bit predictable. Good, but Kubo can so better. Unfortunately, the anime ended right when the manga was going to get good again. The art is amazing. When you first start out, you may think the artwork is amateurish, but as Bleach develops, the artwork improves to the point that it's amazing! The sound...Well, the voices are outstanding, both English and Japanese (considering they have amazing VAs such as Vic Mignogna and Keith Silverstein.) but the music gets old after a bit. The characters are well developed and amazing. I understand that a lot of them get a bad wrap but they just hate them so much to the point that they don't realize how developed they are. Even the minor characters, like Yuzu Kurosaki, have such a well personality. The only problems with the series...are the fillers. They can ANNOY the heck out of you. I suggest if your watching a filler episode and it has Don Kanonji in it, skip it. If your watching a filler season, try and stick it out. Some are worth watching. That goes for filler episodes too.

"This is a fun, spontaneous, action-packed anime. that will guarantee to keep you watching. It is one of my favorite animes of all time. Plot (9/10)-- The plot line was pretty amazing; well thought-out and detailed. If you're looking for a good action anime, this is where you should head to. The moments of intensity are interesting enough to where you want to keep on watching, although it may not live up to absolutely everyone's tastes. Everyone has different opinions, but even if you're unsure of it, I recommend you to give it at least a try. Even though Bleach is a very mainstream anime, they did a very good job on it. The only flaw I can find with it is the filler episodes. There are a ton of filler episodes, filling you in on multiple characters' pasts. You won't really miss much if you skip them, the only thing is that you wouldn't know a lot about that character. They do try to make the filler episodes as interesting as possible; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Otherwise there's nothing else that's really wrong with it. Art (9/10)-- I actually thought the art was done quite well. All the fights that occurred throughout the anime were very well-shown and depicted. Each fight contains something unique of its own, which was most likely purposely done for the sake of entertainment for the viewers, and to keep you watching. The character art is very nice, although the art of the characters does seem to change a bit as the anime progresses. All characters are drawn in a unique matter, depending on what their personality was meant to be and how they are supposed to come across to the viewers. I am not saying it was above and beyond; just that is was done very well. Sound (8/10)-- Personally, I thought the sound was done exceptionally well. The music inserted during the moments of intensity and during fights seems to fit the plot line close to perfect. Since I have only watched the Japanese version, given that Japanese is my primary language, I found the English voice actors sounded a bit strange. Even so, it doesn't really affect how much one would like the anime. It's just a matter of how they sound and what the viewer prefers. Characters (8/10)-- Each character was done very nicely, although I don't like when they leave some of the major characters out for a while, and you don't see them until many episodes later. This may leave some viewers confused as to where the character went and if they're ever going to come back. This personally left me a bit anxious about what was going to happen. At some points, I was afraid that they just randomly disappeared and would never appear again in the anime. Although that wasn't the case, it was still confusing. I enjoyed the style the characters were drawn in, because it fit their personalities fairly well. Overall, I loved it. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine that's an extreme Bleach fangirl, so I decided to try it out, and now I'm fangirling with her. The anime was great, and I found it to be very entertaining.

Ichigo kurosaki is on his way home from school when his family get attacked by an unknown presence he has to gain the powers of a shinigami to see and save his family. I think that the different arc's were great. The music is really good, it builds up tension at the right moment. Even the opening songs were good especially the first one. This anime has so much action its unbelievable and they fights are always epic.

"What to talk about this anime, which has become my favorite anime shot of all and it neither hurts the first one I watch. The histotia and the characters of bleach are unique each different from the other and with its own history and personality, being all well worked and valued in history. one of the strongest points of bleach is that it is a shonen not cliché because the universe created by tite kubo is genius, a human world and the sky that is the society of souls the hollow world that is the world of hollow and having a hell also. -The protagonist different from the other protagonist does not want to be the strongest in the universe, not to be the king of pirates and do not want to be hokage. he did not want anything simply received the power of shinigami and then kept to protect his family, friends and his city. his motivation is only to protect everyone and his personality is shaped through this, he is not a guy who likes to eat a lot and be super nice like most of the protagonist most we can like him although having in the anime characters much cooler as the byakuya and the zaraki for example. the powers he has are not without fundamentals in the manga for example explains why of having each power and having sense and foundation in everything. this anime has a formidable fights beyond its history and the villain of the anime that is in my opinion the most intelligent villain and top of the animes and super charismatic and with a power of sensational manipulation. although the author has lost a bit in the way of his work with bleach, it is still an anime and a manga, with negative and positive points like any other work. -Recomendo watch for your universe created by tite kubo for the seriousness of the story even having humor in the amine, there are deaths in the anime and the manga in their struggles is not that shonen that no one else dies after a while. and also by the characters who are super charismatic and well-worked throughout history. a protagonist with normal ideas and not of superiority or to achieve some type of position or recognition, making him different from the others. -Recommended the anime and the manga.",10,Recommended,"Jan 5, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d8643ca065,14,2166

"Well This anime is one of the huge ones coming in league with inuyasha, kenshin, naruto, one piece ... is a kind which i would suggest you not to follow on continously. But for starters of anime, I suggest this anime to them; skipping the fillers of course. This anime is a good mix of humor, action, supernatural, emotions (which are sometimes very over-dramatically portrayed), and ... you will know when you watch. The story is undoubtedly awesome! Please keep in mind that i am ignoring the filler-story. Watching it removing the fillers gives you the ultimate feeling of awesomeness. If the fillers are skipped, I can bet anything that this anime series would have been a huge success. Even now when i re-watch some of the old episodes, it feels nostalgic and warm.

"If I were to rate the top shōnen anime by popularity, Bleach would be very near the top. The adventure of Ichigo, Rukia, and their school friends to become stronger and overcome great threats with their Soul Reaper and Hollow powers are extremely popular for sword-focused action that has even spawned many video game adaptations. The biggest difference between this form of anime and the others reviewed so far is the sheer expanse of content. Bleach is 366 episodes long, and that is about average for the format (some are still going and have been for over a decade. One Piece is up to 730 episodes, and Naruto Shippuden is past 450 not including its 220 original series run). That makes the barrier for entry much higher and talking about the series a little more difficult. I will try my best to keep things concise, but this means not nearly getting as in-depth with the characters particularly supporting cast as I usually would like.While I didn't mind watching all of Bleach, I would only recommend a certain set of episodes to a new viewer. If you enjoy action and light hearted shōnen drama, you'll enjoy Bleach. If you start to get bored of it early on though, you might want to simply begin skipping ahead.",9,Recommended,"Feb 2, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d9bab1040f,14,1219
"I'm writing this review after having originally watching NONE of the filler then going back and watching the entire series episode for episode. That said if you really want to get the best possible experience out of this show don't watch the filler and especially don't watch the final cannon arc. After having watched this anime my first time (again skipping all the filler) it became my favorite anime of all time and is still in the top 3. If i hadn't watched the last arc it might even be the first BUT that is IF you don't watch the filler. Sadly that is part of the experience of this show. The filler this show contains makes it almost impossible to watch at times and it becomes hard to just keep going. Nonetheless it is obvious why it is considered by a lot to be part of the big 4 in anime (dragon ball z, Naruto, one piece, and bleach) because of the following it has attracted and the action it contains. All this being said if you watch it my recommended way it is a 9/10 or for viewers who love action maybe even a 10/10. But if you watch the show episode for episode it is easily a 6/10 or 7/10.",10,Recommended,"Jun 4, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3bd3629f05,14,1111
"Ah, yes. One of the famous 'BIG THREE' of anime. When I watched this series, the only others that I had watched previously were, you guessed it, Naruto and DB/DBZ. (One Piece came later for me). At the time, I would have given this show a 9/10, considering unfinished work does not deserve a masterpiece rating. With years gained, I have not only watched hundreds of more series, but have also reached young adulthood. And I believe those two factors are the biggest setback to this series. Simply put, Bleach did not age well. This is probably the case for most people who have watched Bleach back in the day. If you are already in your 20s and have watched plenty of 8+ rated series, you will likely not enjoy Bleach. Some may argue, ""but Cope, this is a shounen, it is not fair for you to rate this outside of the target audience"". False. The other series of the BIG THREE, Naruto and One Piece, aged very well. Hell, One Piece is still aging. I honestly believe Bleach can only be enjoyed by the shounen target audience. The pacing is bizarre and the arcs are... repetitive to say the least. I will admit that the first serious arc (after all the world building and filler) is amazing. If they eliminated the filler and adjusted the story to end after the first arc, I would absolutely dub this series a masterpiece. I will also throw them a bone and say that their OST and OPs/EDs are one of the best and a staple in anime music. I give Bleach an 8/10. If you are a true anime fan, then yes, this is considered a must-watch. Who knows, if Bleach truly does return, maybe it will fit the standards of modern anime.",8,Recommended,"Feb 22, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7b912ce8fb,14,1618
"Bleach - easily the most controversial titan of the Big Three - is an action packed, bittersweet ride of a series. The highs are so uniquely satisfying that even now, many years later, few shows have managed to match Bleach at its peak. Even among Bleach's harshest critics, the Soul Society arc has been cemented in history as one of the all-time greatest arcs in Shonen. From there, opinions are largely split on the remainder of the series. If you're familiar with the branch of Dragon Ball fans that would have preferred if the series had ended after Frieza, then you'll mostly understand this split in the fanbase. Personally, I quite enjoyed every canon saga of the series, though I will admit the brief Fullbring arc that the anime concludes with closes the series with more of a fizzle than a bang - though the final battle is a real treat. Nevertheless, I'd like to expand upon Bleach's strengths and sing its high praises since its easily the most underrated and unjustly panned series among the Big Three. In terms of story, you get a mixed but mostly positive bag with Bleach. If you were able to endure the travesty that was the Fourth 'Great' Shinobi War in Naruto, then even the worst Bleach has to offer shouldn't faze you. The show starts off with roughly a dozen episodes in the vein of a 'monster of the week' Yu Yu Hakusho style mystical adventure. Not unlike Hakusho, the series soon becomes serialized, leading into the renowned Soul Society arc. This masterpiece of an arc contains what I consider to be the best reveal ever to come out of a Shonen battle series and at least a dozen antagonists so well-developed and likable that they became mainstays in the show's cast. If you were a fan of Vegeta and Piccolo, you'll feel right at home here. In terms of its rogues gallery, I consider Bleach to be the Batman of anime. (Though Boku no Hero Academia may snatch this title in the future.) Though the quality of art is largely subjective, most agree that Bleach's art pops more than most of its peers. The general aesthetic and character designs are absolutely superb and distinct. While Naruto and One Piece also share this strength, I have to say that Bleach's designs have always seemed the coolest. Kubo himself would admit that he's more of an artist than a storyteller. Oftentimes the story derives from nothing more than a cool panel he had in mind and practically all of these panels are beautifully realized in the anime. (With the obvious exception of the Thousand Year Blood War, which has yet to be animated at the time of this review.) Coupled with Bleach's art, the soundtrack of the series ties for the show's greatest strength. The legend Shiro Sagisu does his very best work yet here and his score enhances the battle anime in all the right ways. Hype osts, heart wrenching keys, and bewitching tunes can all be found in ample supply throughout the series. The show's general sound effects are also nothing to scoff at. You can't truly appreciate how good the sword clashes sound until you've seen something akin to Berserk (2016), but once you've come to know bad sound effects, those on display in Bleach might as well be music to your ears. Brace yourselves, for this will likely be my most controversial statement yet. Bleach has the best characters of the Big Three by a mile. It was tempting to give the series a 9 or 10 in the character department. If you've been drawn to characters such as Hisoka, Rock Lee, Zoro, and Bakugo from other well known anime, then you will absolutely adore the characters in this colorful classic. While most other series are lucky to have 5 worthwhile characters that remain captivating through the entirety of their series, Bleach excels in this category. Shunsui, Kenpachi, Byakuya, Ulquiorra, Aizen, Kisuke, Rukia, and more all remain among my very favorite fictional characters to this very day. However, I'm unable to give the series a 10 in this category - much as I'd like to - due to the fact we're not given a satisfying resolution to a few members of the vast cast. Though it's nowhere near as glaring as in Naruto Shippuden when practically everyone from part 1 was criminally sidelined and left to rot for the remainder of the series, it is still worth noting that not all of the great characters in Bleach that you come to love are fully realized. This is particularly true in the anime's case. I'm admittedly very biased when it comes to my love for Bleach, but don't take that to mean that the series is anything less than very enjoyable. If you're able to trudge through the horrendous pacing of One Piece's anime - don't misunderstand me, the manga is phenomenal - and Naruto's constant stumbles, then you will certainly be able to forgive Bleach its faults and enjoy the ride as you have with the other members of the Big Three. Whether or not it will be your personal favorite of the trio isn't for me to say, but I can confidently say that if you give it a chance, you're in for a comparatively pleasant experience. Bleach more than earns its place in the prolific Three.",8,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_26296d47c8,14,5070
"If you love good old shounen fights, then Bleach is for you. I'm watching this after 17 years and was quite impressed with how well the story turned out even though I find it harder to get into older looking anime. This anime cemented the fact that I still love shounen. I loved the Gotei 13 with Ichigo and their journey together. The chemistry between him and Rukia is great. It's the most enjoyable part of the series for me. The Gotei 13 were well written and have a lot of depth and personality to them. Some characters never develop as much as I would have liked. Not every character was intended to be developed from my understanding. Sometimes plot armor can get in the way. That didn't bother me, but I can see how it would bother others. From the filler arcs, I can recommend the Zanpakuto rebellion and the Captain Amagai arcs. The Regai arc was mediocre. The bount arc was awful. Well done to Kubo and the team.

"As a newcomer to anime bleach almost had a reputation of being the weakest of the big 3 and not worth anyone's time, if you are on the fence about watching this series then I must stress at the very least giving it a try. This is really the first shounen I'd watched, as I tried and failed to get into Naruto, One Piece, HxH etc... but regardless I had some serious enjoyment in watching this series. At the time of writing this review I am at the start of the arrancar arc, and already it is noticeably better than the filler bount arc before it. After mulling over the soul society arc for a while I realised that it was probably up there with some of the greatest media I had ever consumed. The first couple of arcs establish a precedent for the world, the powers that exist in it and why, but there is always a sense of mystery prevalent that only amplifies when the SS arc begins. Right from when they enter the seireitei answers become available to the viewer, but even more questions arise, Kubo really displays absolutely masterful writing and storytelling. The moment the first fight begins the story only builds with intensity and pure ferocity, each fight connects to the last and has wholly unique motive and established reasoning. Even as I'm writing this review I can't believe the utter scenes that had been displayed from start to finish. I found myself actually caring about fight scenes in anime, along with character development and motives, and sweet baby jesus the soundtrack. On the precipice of defeat perfectly sums up bleach in a few distinct noises that build up unbelievable hype in each scene it is used. A thin thread of plot is expertly weaved through the entire arc that connects and makes sense of what is unfolding , and a brilliant twist occurs that is actually meaningful and impacts the series moving forward. New important places and a large cast of well written, interesting characters are also introduced. Somehow every aspect of the arc is balanced well and keeps the entertainment with almost know let up, do yourself a favour and watch Bleach, at the very least up to the soul society arc",9,Recommended,"Jul 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5f67ebc688,15,2130
"Filler filler filler filler filler filler... I don't know how anybody could watch this series while it actually aired. They would start a battle between, who cares and who cares, get halfway through it, skip and episode by adding filler about a soccer game or going to the beach, and then finish it up two weeks later. I would have gone insane if I didn't already have all of the episodes at my disposal. Rather I wouldn't have started the anime in the first place. Story:7 Really I give anything a 7 if I find it moderately entertaining, and the Bleach story was just that. If you sum it up in a couple sentences it really doesn't sound half bad. Regular human boy given the chance to be all that he could be, a story about the strength of heart etc etc. Even goes to 'Heaven' to fight 'Angels' and wins, then sides with them and kicks total arse. The ending was a let down though, once Ichigo had transcended every single character in the anime they mentioned something about the soul king, but never got to it. (Maybe that is why there are movies of Bleach, I don't know I have only finished the television series) But the story gets repetitive if I multiply it by say.... 366. Just between you and me, I skipped much of the filler within the series to get to the parts focusing solely on Ichigo. Ichigo had the most interesting conflict within him the entire series, although it wasn't much it was still a psychological battle and might have been better if it had not been deluded over 366 episodes. At the end when the big titted shinigami is like head over heals for Gin, that was also a tiny tear jerker out of nowhere. Art: 5 I give the art a 5 due to the fact.... the animation was mediocre. Not bad, not good. And during his fights with Grimmjow then continuing throughout the series was the weird live action animation, like the kind you see for terrible hentai games where everything looks like it was made in Microsoft paint. I mean that the colors were very bold and poorly faded. (probably not the actual problem, heck that might have been the animation getting better) Sound: 5 Why a 5 you ask? It's like watching any kind of slasher movie ever made, they use, reuse, then use again the same sound affects. Whenever something would dawn on Ichigo in ANY way ANY time, they would play the same little jingle for about 10 seconds. Character: 6 Overly powerful main character that learns about true friendship *cough* check. I hated how stupid he was. And the only 'smart' main main character was the Quincy. And at times it seemed that he would just pull conclusions out of his arse. Ichigo did get all of his power from himself though... GO TEAM! I give the anime a 7, because it was not quite deserving of an 8. My only draw to this anime was to see how far Ichigo could go, seeing as that Ichigo never died I finished the series. Cool repetitive battles await, and lots and LOTS of filler. Some of the 'arcs' or storylines were completely unneeded, and trivial. More mature than One Piece and Naruto? Possibly, but a once you go Shonen you stay Shonen for 366 episodes.",7,Recommended,"Jun 2, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_acdf2435c8,15,3086
"Bleach is one of the large shounen anime that exist in the anime world, along with the all-too familiar Naruto, One Piece, etc. So, if you've seen any either or of Naruto or One Piece, you probably already have a general idea of Bleach. It's got action, maybe not the best plot, some comedy here and there, a bit of romance, and a lot of stuff thrown together. Now, when I first started watching Bleach, I said to myself ""This is the best show ever"", and it truly was. Back then, when Bleach was pretty much the only anime show I knew existed, I truly believed this series was THE BEST. Just like how some people who started their anime adventure with Naruto or One Piece, these kind of anime draw you in with a new genre and action you haven't necessarily seen before. That's why you see new anime watchers giving Bleach and Naruto huge scores of 10 here and 10 there, throwing around the term ""masterpiece"" everywhere. But as you delve more into Bleach, you start to realize the overused plot idea, the fact that Orihime is a useless girl who pretty much needs to be saved every single time. I respect Ichigo, because if I were brought into the world of Soul Reapers and I had this whinny bitch saying she loves me and going off on her own and getting killed and I had to save her MULTIPLE TIMES, I probably would just stop saving her after the second time. Enemy says ""We have Orihime, we control you now"" I say ""More like, you have Orihime, and I don't give a shit"" But nope. Ichigo will continue to save Orihime because she's proven how useful she is to him. That is... how useful her huge boobs are to Ichigo Anyways, I've made Bleach sound like some retarded show, but it really isn't. I'm not going to say it's your typical shounen anime, because it might be a little better, but for experienced anime watchers, you're probably going to know or what to expect from this show. When I first watched Bleach and thinking that it was the best show in the world, as I continued to watch more and more anime. I realized that there is so much more anime that has everything Bleach has and much more. I'm not going to lie. If you're one of those people who just want a casual anime to watch, or you're new to anime, Bleach is probably a great introduction. But for those of you who are experienced, Bleach is probably not going to satisfy you. There are some great action moments where you get the suspenseful feeling, but there are many more animes that have just that, except they don't have 366 episodes. The art in Bleach is what you would expect, it's nothing special, just a typical shounen anime. Soundtrack is overused, but they have some REALLY good songs for the fight scenes, some in particular which drew me to the series one-handed. The story is overused, standard soul reaper story. You'll understand what I mean if you watch it. There isn't too much character development in Bleach, but it's what you'd expect from a shounen anime mostly focused on enjoyment and action. Overall, I give Bleach an 8, since it is the first anime I saw and I probably enjoyed it more than I would enjoy it if I watched it now. It's not terrible, it has some nice parts to it, but I don't think ALL 366 episodes are worth your time, you can skip through the filler and some unimportant episodes here and there. I guess I'll list out my ratings here: Story: 7 Art: 7 Sound: 9 Character: 6 Enjoyment: 8 Overall: 8 Remember, the button names. It's was the review helpful or not helpful.

"This was my absolute favourite anime before I watched Hunter x Hunter 2011. Everything about it just dragged me in and made me enjoy it. The art style may start off slightly odd (normal for 2006 ish anime), but makes a dramatic improvement by the second arc. The story is well crafted and little details are not missed out. The only problem people may have of this are the fillers, but when I watched it, the fillers were pretty amazing, unlike in Naruto where they were completely unrelated to what was actually happening in the main story. Every single opening is just amazing and I'm torn between which one is my favourite out of the second and first because they're just so great and hits you with that nostalgia and upbeat tune. The characters are pretty decent, some of them can get annoying and stale (Orihime, Chad), there are some there for comedic effect which can get slightly annoying depending on your type of humour (Kon and that other spirit medium guy that's usually there in the fillers). Otherwise, characters like Uryu (mostly in the manga), Ichigo and the soul reaper (shinigami) captains/lieutenants end up going through some development and add a lot to the story, making it much more interesting and entertaining. The vast majority of characters, even antagonists, are likeable and, even though it is centred around Ichigo, there are a lot of times where he ISN'T the main protagonist and other characters do have to undergo changes and problems that they have to solve themselves.",10,Recommended,"Jul 11, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c3923cf9fb,15,1504
"One of the three currently-airing mega-popular animes, Bleach is a lot of things: 1. It has an interesting story behind it, but unfortunately, the anime has been butchered by the amount of fillers in it (the new captain arc and the bount arc) 2. It has a very stereotypical shonen-esque plot to it (in the sense that I WAS DEFEATED BY YOU, SO FIVE MINUTES LATER I'M STRONGER THAN YOU HOORAY!) 3. It has a lot of funny jokes 4. Almost every episode involves a sexual reference 5. It follows the number one rule of shonen animes: if a character is about to die, they must have a long-ass flashback and lots of dramatic music. To keep this review short, so you don't have to see craploads of paragraphs like 90% of the reviewers, this show has the following aspects: - Like most shonen animes, it has 99.9% useless fillers, and a few funny ones worth watching - It has an amazing soudntrack (number one is the trademark song in the series, remade multiple times) - The abilities of the characters are cool, but sometimes repetitive - The quality of the videos improves as the episodes go on Although the author has announced that there is potentially ten more years of content in the manga, the anime has rumoured to be ending after the Aizen arc.

"Bleach..... a manga/review that almost any anime fan would know. This would be recommened for 13+ because of the violence, ecchi, and blood in this anime. This anime is a shounen jump series where the anime is an adaption to the manga. This anime was truly amazing, the plot/story was complexed but was complex enough for anybody to understand. So to refresh your mind if you haven't already, bleach is about a normal teenager that had his life changed forever when he can see hollows (creatures that have no heart and feed on people for their misery/ for power) as well as shinigami (people that get rid of hollows. He comes to meet the girl protaganist quite quickly where he takes almost all Rukia (girl protaganist)'s shinigami powers to battle the hollow that destroyed his home and wound his family. From there he became the substitute shinigami in substitude for Rukia. The art was fairly well done, i was really into the graphics, however i didn't like the character drawings. At the very beginning, when Rukia was first seen I thought she was a guy! But when she started talking I was like ""whoa that guy has a girl voice"". But then I realized that she was a girl. Usually girls in anime aren't ""flat chest"" so maybe because of that I didn't realize that she was a girl sooner, and back then I was a total anime newb. Well maybe that was just me, but after I got used to her looks and she's like one of my favorite characters! The sound was acceptable, I wouldn't say it was too good or too bad. I really like the emotions that the voice actors put in when they get emotional or slashed lol. I really have no comment for character except for it's PERFECT! This is what I expected for bleach, characters were so well done, I loved Ichigo's and Rukia's personality the best!

" (obviously) Bleach will always be known for being apart of the legendary big 3, why's that? Bleach is focused on a 15 year old teen named Kurosaki Ichigo who can see spirits. A rare ability to say the least, anyways Ichigo goes on a lot of adventures, facing many adversaries on the way. Bleach also has an amazing story and a fantastic cast. As well, as great openings and ending sequences.. Bleach even has a spin off show (Burn The Witch). Although, not all the glitter is gold because It has a ton of filler. I think the reason the big 3 are called the big 3 is because they have the most filler(just kidding, its manga sales)",8,Recommended,"Apr 21, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_6af1eac6dc,15,631
"Bleach is considered one of the most difficult anime to value; Sometimes it is good and sometimes it is bad, And I think Bleach has a good ost crew, but they have a downside to making filler episodes apart from a few episodes. The ending was beautiful and I wanted to rate it up but I didn't forget the time I was boring because of it.

"And 6 years later, I finally finish this anime. I loved Bleach during its run, but like many fans at the time, I felt the anime should've finished with the battle with Aizen. As the Fullbringer arc began, it was just lackluster and I ended up losing interest. The final arc wasn't terrible, but after the big payoff with Aizen, after years of buildup, it was just excessive. But, that can't take away from how awesome this anime was at the time. The two things that shined for me was the great battles and the fantastic cast of characters. Seriously, this anime had so many great characters it probably holds the record for them, from Kenpachi and Urahara, to Yoruichi and Chad. A seriously entertaining cast of characters and seriously intense battles. I still remember the battles between Ichigo and Kenpachi, Byakuya, Grimjow, Aizen and Ulchiora. Of course, like with any long running anime, the filler harms the pacing and overall anime, but the main episodes truly shined. So, I'm giving this an 8 out of 10, due to the filler and the fact that the anime went on too long and should have ended on a high note with Aizen, rather then ending up being canceled.

"So personally in my opinion I think the anime is good overall (ignore the fillers though they are more enjoyable than other shows). I think the story is good covering a lot of different themes that feel more realistic. The only problem I had with the anime is that they stopped right before the last arc but no worries the last arc is adapted sometimes this year. Apparently I think the art is amazing and the OST's are the best. I personally like Ichigo as a character because he is one of the most realistic protagonists. I guess I pretty much enjoyed the show except for the first filler arc which was not that nice at all. Overall I think this is an underrated show, there are a lot of misconceptions about the show.

"I remember seeing commercials for this on Cartoon Network. Actually Cartoon Network really did not do the Anime justice. I actually avoided the anime due to the impression the commercials gave of the overall feel for the show.... A successful commercial needs to reflect the show. Co-worker pushed me to actually sit and watch and he said wait through the first season because it starts to really get good at that point. He was dead on! The art style takes a little getting use to. The character development is real key to the success of the stories. Each one can stand on its own, and they bring you up to speed very nicely if you missed a episode. There is a lot of rolling mystery of over arching story arch that also is well written. My only problem is there are way too many episodes to try and own, so renting is key or patiently waiting for it to air for most.",10,Recommended,"Feb 11, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_150b1a117a,15,867
"I will try to cover up/not tell any spoilers! Read at your own risk(s), if there are any... I remember, Bleach from a long time ago, I was young, maybe in the first grade. Bleach was one of the first, if not the first anime's I have ever watched or seen (Fruits Basket was my first, I think; I was in Kindergarten...). After many years of not watching anime, I finally decided to get back into anime, so this was undoubtedly my first choice onto what to watch (and SAO, but that was an ""OK!"" mistake I guess) Heading into Bleach I didn't know what to expect. Being a part of the (epic voice over )""BIG THREEEEEE"" I knew that I wasn't going to be in for a story and plot worth mentioning, I knew that the development would be lacking, I knew that for this anime alone, I would have to rely on me solely just liking it, because being a part of the big three... we all know fillers will occur. Still, Bleach did surprise me. (OH, AND, Fillers don't count towards anything IMO--so I'm leaving all of those out) Story 6/10 (Well, let's just dive right into it!) Bleach is about a carrot top boy named Ichigo Kurosaki, an ordinary normal human boy, transformed into a soul reaper (AKA shinigami, AKA death god) in a single night. As he is transformed, mystical (you could even say magical), weird, and fate changing events occur. This is the base of the story, and the story arcs will all revolve around soul reapers. Now many say that just watching episodes 1-63 will suffice, and I truly do agree with that, because this is where the show genuinely did shine.(Spoiler) From watching Ichigo being a boring substitute soul reaper, not knowing anything about soul reapers in general, to getting introduced to the other characters, to the episode where he and his family visit his mothers grave, then to him getting owned by the pink guy (DANK MEME BRO), to then getting to know zangetsu, and all the other soul reapers... There was just a taaaaad bit more detail in story here than anywhere else in the series. At this point the story was pretty well thought out, and there weren't many if not zero plot holes. But it's in these first arcs, that make the show how it is ... unstoppable... because how the anime was created and shown, it was supposed to drag out, to keep on going, to become this never ending battle. So, this is where I think story wise, it all goes down hill. Too many sub plots, or rather sub/supporting characters are introduced, and these supporting characters all have their own stories to add on to the show which could be a good thing, but in this case it is a bad thing. Because going into the arrancar arc(s), the story was focused more on battle and the end game, so at this point the, ""life"" aspect is completely neglected, and the use of their school is to not to learn and be normal teens, but to run to the bathroom so they can slay some hollows. Now at this time they sort of want you to transition from school sort of being an objective, to simply just fighting and battling, which is what Bleach didn't need. But that is exactly what Bleach is, simply put, ""Fight."" So having every episode completely focused on battling, and nothing else is quite the norm. Although that just lead to having no interesting story and plot, it was dry and left my mouth bitter needing water. (Spoiler) I'm not saying that Ichigo getting his hollow mask, him learning to control his bankai, and him diving into hueco mundo is a bad story, it was just bland. BUT it was cool to watch, action packed, and had a lot of good sayings in it. Basically, they had an original story, and then stuffed it like a turkey with more story, but then ended up taking out a bit of everything, because if they didn't the turkey would have burst. In this case, we didn't get a juicy succulent turkey, we got a dry over cooked turkey with mushy veggies in it. If you understood that analogy, thank god. Now the overall story (I thought the overall story revolved around Aizen and the Arrancar arcs) had a good plot and I was really hyped up for it. Because during the Hueco Mundo arcs, you learn all about the hollows and their forms. They had some epic fights, and it helped progress the story. At the time I thought the show would have ended at the Aizen arc, but it didn't and I was confused. Turns out there was more... People will hate on the Fullbring arc but I actually enjoyed it. In my honest opinion this is what the show was missing, just life. Sure it wasn't the best arc, because of how it was executed, but that could be said about all arcs. All in all it just let me relax, it let me think of a time when Bleach's story wasn't so jumbled up everywhere, it showed that everyone was living a normal life, but of course (spoiler) Ichigo wouldn't want that because a change of fate occurred. It was by far the most complex, down to earth, annoying, predictable arc ever made, but I liked that. All in all, i give Bleach a 6 in story, simply because the story was cut simple and dry. There simply were no complex problems to bleach that had to be solved, each arc just felt the same to me. Bleach relies more on its characters, battles and those ""WOAW!?"" moments rather than its story, which is a bit saddening, but I still enjoyed the story (up until the aizen arc, I don't wanna count the fullbring arc as the end, simply because it's just not a good ending). Art 8/10 Spanning from 2004-2012 the art progressed and got better. There really isn't much to say here, it was very pleasant to my eyes. Some scenes are questionable (Orihime... put down that leek!) but overall I enjoyed how everything was designed. The openings were pretty good I guess, some better than others for sure, I wasn't really into the endings, except for a few. (The opening with Asian Kung-Fu Generation's After Dark was so amazing) Sound 9/10 By FAR the thing I loved most about Bleach was its soundtrack. There are some pieces of music-ART! On there that I can't ignore, I love listening to OST's from Bleach. Plus their openings and endings, oh my I simply just loved them! The voice acting was pretty spot on, except English Ichigo and Japanese head captain. You might disagree with me on the captain, but I think the English head captain was way more bomb than the Japanese version. And lets face it, Ichigos English version is so troll... Character 6/10 For MAIN characters you have of course Kurosaki Ichigo, Kuchiki Rukia, Ishida Uryuu, Sado Yasutora (AKA CHAD), Inoue Orihime, and although listed as supporting, Abarai Renji. Now there are so many supporting characters, it makes me wanna throw up, but anyways...! Throughout the show these will be the main characters, you'll follow them in their endeavors and see what they're up to. Now I stated this before, I stated that Bleach relies more on the characters than the story or some other points, and I believe that to be true. I just, I just... I just, I'm so disappointed with how it ended. You see everyone ""matures"" which is sort of true I guess, you can see Ichigo thinking more before a battle, rather than just going in, (spoiler) he states that he tries to feel what the enemy is feeling through crossing blades. And this is pretty much true for every character, everyone ""grows"" but its more of a ""lets change for the better, with each other, lets change and become strong enough to do this!"" Which to say the least is very generic, and to be quite (filthy) frank these ""changes"" aren't even noticeable, I had to ask someone to point out to me how they changed through out the series... Maybe I'm just too stupid to understand, who knows. Now there's this thing with people hating on the back story of the arrancars, and I'm not going to lie, I'm almost apart of that hate. But... it's this small character development, that makes up for the story, this bland, predictable story. The backstories are there, not to only give the arrancars more than a name, but to make up for a story lacking in actually being a story. Which is why I'm so happy with how the arrancars developed. Even though the characters weren't executed that well, I'm not really disappointed because I didn't expect many things to get explained in the first place. The battles are truly amazing in Bleach it's what makes Bleach, Bleach, I can't help but watch a few of the battles over, and over again. And no, not because they are flashy, and colorful and big, but because every little detail has a meaning to it. Every zanpakuto has a name and soul, every flashy skill has a name, I mean just everything has a name and meaning behind it. And the battles really do make up for pretty much everything in Bleach. The characters when they battle are amazing, they change when in battle, and then intensify the battle. Honestly I don't think the fights in Bleach get enough praise. Even though I'm disappointed with how alll characters ended up, I'm not angry, nor sad about how many characters there were. In fact I actually liked the abundant amount of characters there were. It made the show seem fuller, and believe me, in a (366 - 201) 165 episode anime, where story and plot are lacking, having characters and battles make up for it is better than nothing. Personal Enjoyment 10/10 Even though it seems as though I must hate Bleach for critiquing it so horribly. Bleach is actually one of my favorite anime's. Not because of characters, or the battles. But for, yes the story (and of course the music). In my eyes, if Bleach was executed better, if it had less time wasters in it, and had a more up beat-slower pace to things, I would've been in love. I wouldn't have put this down, I wouldn't have stopped watching (Ironic, because I didn't anyways)... I thoroughly enjoyed Bleach, because I accepted it for what it is, and it just fits me for what I'm into. There isn't much to say, I just enjoyed Bleach. Overall 7/10 ( maybe 6.5/10) Overall I think I'm being lenient on the overall score. Why? Because Story and Character make up pretty much all of the ""Overall"" score, and personally, Bleach just lacks on both story and characters very heavily. For being 165 episodes long, not having a good story, and not having good characters will literally kill the series... In my eyes, I should have given this a 6, but Bleach did good to cover up its holes in the areas in which it was lacking. Finishing Notes! Bleach is an anime that people love, and an anime that people hate. It's an anime where people have mixed feelings for it, an anime that could be worth your time, or it might just waste your time. I sincerely say this, as genuinely as I can as an anime reviewer and watcher... I really can't recommend this anime to anyone, because in my eyes, it's just not good. Personally, I enjoyed this, you might have also, but for those of you who haven't watched Bleach, I can't say whether or not it's worth your time... That I leave up to you!

"Bleach is an anime in my mind that could have been a lot better, but then again i didn't wright the story. First of all the main story line, once you take out the unneeded fillers, was a good anime. The one thing I hated about this show is that Ichigo is pretty invincible throughout the whole story. First he goes and saves rukia and goes through the soul society an is a top fighter there after not even two full days of training and its all based on determination to save rukia. Then goes to Hueco Mundo and fights an beats coutless Arrancar including Espada. Not to mention he gets orihime back despite what happens to him. *Just for the Record Ulquiorra is a B.A.* Then he Finally fights izan and finds yet another power in order to win.... If Ichigo would have lost more in this series i would have liked it more or done extensive training for big boss battles i could see it being better. Thats my only issue with this story. I do like the variety of characters and different zanpakutos and everyone takes time to be able to use the bankai and master it, unlike ichigo.

"Ok, I find the big 3 (Naruto,Bleach,One Piece) very overrated, mainly because everybody only talks about these three shows and nothing else. Nevertheless, Bleach as a show is good because it follows it's manga perfectly and the soul society arc is probably one of the best shounen arcs of all time. Ok what are the flaws well it has WAY TO MUCH FILLER, so much they made filler arcs. The beginning of the show can be kind of slow pace at times and sometimes feel as a generic shounen show at times.

"Bleach is, and always has been/will be, one of my favorite anime. However, it isn't without its flaws. Story 8/10: The main plotline of Bleach revolves around Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15 year-old boy that is able to see ghosts. Then, he gains power to protect his family/friends/etc. Kind of cliche, right? In the first season or two, yes, the story is a bit cliche. However, the rest of the show (Aside from the horrible, horrible filler arcs), is fairly original. Art 8/10: Also in the beginning seasons of Bleach, the art wasn't what we might expect from a modern-day anime. Slowly, though, it seemed to improve, especially (in my opinion) regarding Rukia's appearance. Sound 10/10: Even though you can expect the opening and ending themes to change every now and then, I believe the animators do a great job in picking out these for the show. The background music, as well, helps to add to the mood of the action, drama, romance, etc. scenes throughout the series. Character 9/10: Some characters in Bleach, mainly in the filler arcs, are not in the manga, and thus can be considered irrelevant, and are usually only used for comic relief. Casting these characters aside, the main protagonists (Rukia & Ichigo) are well-developed. The rest of the character cast seems to be what almost everyone has in their group of friends: A ditzy blonde, the desperate guy, the player, the rebel.. You get the idea. Enjoyment 8/10: As I've mentioned, the fillers in Bleach are 99% of the time are absolutely HORRID. They, I believe, are the worst part of the series as a whole. Once the regular plotlines begin after a long, dreadful line of filler episodes, though, I find this series to be very enjoyable, however I would personally recommend the manga over the anime. Overall, I give Bleach an 8/10. It has its flaws, but it is still a good anime, all things considered.",8,Recommended,"Jun 14, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_047fdcc64a,15,1858
"This is one of those anime that gets talked up a little more than it should. It covers the manga up until the second to last story arc (the manga is currently in the final arc). It is a great story though. It does have great characters, and the action grows to epic proportions towards the end. I will admit that some of my favorite anime fight scenes are in this series, but there are some issues with the story telling. I'll start with the good stuff. Ichigo is a great main character. He is very charismatic, and he cares deeply for his friends and family. He tries to do the right thing and protect innocent people (even strangers). He has an immense amount of spiritual power which makes him a target for hollows (the evil spirits they fight in this series). I like that he becomes a shinigami (like a reaper basically) early on, and it's lightened a lot with good comedy. Friends are made through fighting a lot of the time so there are a lot of rivals that drive each other. There are a lot of colorful characters in this series. If anything, the characters save it from the flawed delivery of the story. There is a lot of mystery in this story which serves as the ""hook"" of the story. Now for a little bad. I found the overall storytelling slowed down to a crawl often times. The story itself wasn't bad, just the way it was told became a problem for me. The concept was so interesting that I wanted to like it more than I actually did. A lot of questions get asked but not answered since Ichigo doesn't care. The amount of unanswered questions really started to bother me after a while. Here's the biggest problem with Bleach. This anime series is a little shy of 50% filler. The problem with that is the main character is the type of hero that grows in strength at a constant accelerated rate. With filler arcs there is no growth (there literally cannot be in order to make sense in the main story). The filler is this anime's greatest downfall, especially because there are a couple of filler arcs that start in the middle of a main arc. They don't even squeeze them in properly. This makes it really hard to skip the filler. The first time through I watched all of the filler, and because I read the manga later I found that it could have been an 8 or 9. I give it a 7 if you skip filler, and it gets the slightly lower mark because if you skip filler you unfortunately miss bits and pieces of the main storyline as well. In short, if you want a story with great action, great characters, good comedy, super powers, and you don't care too much about the story then this is for you. Bleach is a GOOD anime, and it's worth a watch so definitely don't skip it.",7,Recommended,"Jan 25, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_77bda3e779,15,2669

"Im so pissed for giving Bleach a 9, it deserves a freaking 10! So much missed potential... With having literal 45% filler percentage(163/366 eps), it still faired pretty well. Majority of the fillers were nice, but they always seemed to come right before a hyped event, which always makes you frustrated. The second biggest problem for me was the ending. Instead of stopping the show after the end of the Aizen Arc, giving it much bigger emotional weight in regards to Ichigo`s sacrifice, they have decided to do the Fullbringer Arc which was not only boring to watch(honestly it felt like a filler arc) but the ending was meek as well. We havent even seen the full extent of Ichigo`s new powers...Only showed 1 empowered Getsuga Tenshou, nothing special.... At atleast it was nice to see Byakuya finally boldly showing his respect towards Ichigo. And the third biggest problem is the lack of action in the anime. Compared to Naruto and One Piece, it was refreshing to watch a shounen with quick battles lasting only 2-3 eps max. However there werent many quality fights of Hollow Ichigo taking over and showing the full extent of Ichigo`s powers. I wanted to watch more chaos and destruction, not some 3rd rate characters like Chad/Hinamori/Hisagi/Matsumoto/Iba/Oomaeda/Kira/Espada`s Fraccion/Bounto fight. All the Vasto Lorde + Tousen, except Ulquiorra, were a disappointent too. Despite beeing introduced to be stronger than a captain, they were defeated too quickly(especially Harribel !!!). And the last bit is also cutting down on the emotional side. Sure cutting down on fights duration was refreshing but shortening the emotional windows made Bleach kinda shallow at times. We should have had more Zangetsu/Aizen/Gin screen time to make it truly impactful and unforgettable, the already awesome experience of watching Bleach!!! The OST and sound effects were pure 10/10.

"I can't believe this was an anime I used to enjoy back when I was a kid. I don't even understand why this anime is rated 7 on MAL. It should be 5 or 6 max. Story: The anime was terribly directed. The constant fillers were distracting and were inserted randomly in the middle of important story arcs. Whoever directed this anime needs to be fired. The fight scenes were terribly drawn out with unnecessary dramatic dialogue. There were also so many unnecessary recap episodes. This anime didn't even need that many recap episodes because the first 4-7 minutes of every single freaking episode they have is pretty much a recap of either the last episode or that entire arc. You can literally go run a mile outside and come back and be just in time for the main part of the episode. This anime took 366 episodes to get to the point when it could have done it in half the number of episodes. Actually, Bleach never got to the end because they decided to cancel it because it wasn't doing well. Gee, I wonder why. When you destroy your own anime by inserting a bunch of poorly executed fillers, you're bound to turn away viewers. The comedy was also poorly timed. The jokes in themselves are trite. At first, they were bearable, but after 100 episodes of the same thing, it gets tiresome. The anime just tries way too hard to lighten up all the serious scenes by injecting unnecessary gags and comic relief. Well, needless to say, it didn't work. Rather, I think it had the opposite effect. I felt irritated if anything. Characters: The characters were all irritating too. They always talk too much during the battles. They don't strategize very well. Even the smart characters are terrible at critical thinking. Character development focuses mainly on Ichigo, while everyone is pretty much an extra. The female characters' development were especially horrible. For the entire 300 something show, Rukia and Orihime never grow stronger. They remained useless compared to Ichigo. I get that this show is a shounen, but is it necessary to diminish the female characters' capabilities in order for the main male protagonist to be strong? Can they not grow together emotionally, mentally, and physically? Can men only be strong when women are weak? Would strong female characters make the male characters weak? Completely irritating to see how useless the female characters turned out. Furthermore, Ichigo as a character became way too OP. His weaknesses only show up when he's insecure. Most of the time, he's just a reckless, arrogant dumbass who somehow thinks he can take care of everything. The internal dialogue of the characters did nothing to make them three dimensional. It was really just poor writing and execution. Art: The art was okay. Nothing special. There are anime out there that rival Bleach's art, and there are plenty anime out there that are way better drawn than Bleach. Enjoyment: My enjoyment of the anime was negatively impacted by the poorly executed story and poorly written character development. Rather than something relaxing to watch during my break, I ended up feeling immense frustration at the characters and the story's direction. Overall: Don't waste your time watching this anime. If anything, I would only watch the first 50 episodes or so of the Rukia arc, and take my leave. (But skip the fillers!!!) Otherwise you're just wasting your time.

Bounts arcs was the worst thing I have been put through in a while. Fullbring was equally bad. I just pretend those don't exist. Cool art design for all the characters. This is definitely a shounen of it's time. We all know who the main character is because he's ""super amazing"" and pulls wins out of his butt. I was disappointed a few times by storylines not panning or things seemingly get obstructed by typical shounen logic where they bluff and talk big and the fallthrough is weak.",8,Recommended,"May 13, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9a9a678c19,16,662
"WARNING: SPOILERS Bleach was the first anime I picked up after having taken about a 3-4 year break from watching anime. The first season was so good, so intriguing, there was something to be had by watching this. Who are these mysterious blade wielding spirits, and what are they doing here fighting monsters that seemingly nobody can see? Well after the first season you pretty much learn everything you need to know about them. The second season is just the first season with different enemies. The bounts were pretty cool, and they still had potential for the series, however after this there was no justification in watching this anymore. Having invested so much time into the series already I felt I had to stick around for the art if not the story. Everything just repeats itself and it feels so redundant and just a waste of time. Favorite Character(s): Byakuya Kuchiki, Yoruichi Shihouin Byakuya is my favorite purely based on aesthetics, nothing else. Yoruichi is such a cool character that continues to surprise as a ninja master. Why they are a male cat and a female woman is beyond me and unnecessary, but doesn't take away from the brash character that many respect.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 21, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a36090fadc,16,1179
"Personally, I do not recommend Bleach. The first 3 arcs were good, but when it got to the bount arc I really lost interest. The farther i went into the series the more bored i became with it. The art style changes so drastically from the first episode compared to the last and the new art style looks absolutely horrid. Another thing about Bleach is that it is a very predictable anime.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 3, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7b06bc4672,16,386
"I have never seen an anime drop so low in quality in my life. The first two arcs were amazing. From a great story to compelling characters to amazing fight scenes, it was easy to see why the series became one of top three most popular ongoing manga in the Shonen Jump magazine. However, after that point the story Tite Kubo set up seemed to come crumbling down and Kubo didn't know how to put it back together. Character development is now basically showing their back story instead of any actual development and many plot points that are meant to set up character development never come to fruition and are never addressed again. The Arrancar Arc gets interrupted in the middle by two filler arcs back to back, the filler is so bad that there are almost as many filler episodes as there are canon episodes and it just seems to drag on forever, and honestly I wish it had just stopped there. The Fullbringer Arc is uninteresting and completely devoid of all the things that made Bleach great in the first place. The action and music is still there but it just isn't the same.",4,Not Recommended,"Mar 20, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_355984cfb1,16,1075
"Bleach is an almost perfect embodiment of the shounen genre in my opinion. The story starts out well and you easily get drawn into it. The reason is really the characters, because they are so unique and interesting. The issue I have, and the reason I won't give it a higher rating is the fact that the story often feels fragmented. It is because of the fact that there are sudden moments of escalation followed by long stretches where it all plateaus. Nevertheless they must have done something right for the series to have such a following. The best way I can describe this anime is as a complete package. Although there are some weaknesses and holes present within the story the fact is this series has everything from comedy to tragedy, and straight up action scenes. It's the type of anime that will keep you coming back even though there doesn't seem to be anything spectacular about it. In terms art there really isn't anything special about it at all, but I don't think that is what the viewer should be worried about. The plethora of interesting characters will keep you far too busy for the art to get in the way of enjoying the show. Really this show is for anyone looking for an anime that combines the shounen, super power and supernatural themes into one interesting plot, but isn't serious in terms of its overall mood. //Spoilers(maybe?)// More like a fair warning, but the anime does end relatively suddenly in what seems like the middle of the story. Well that is because it does, the manga is still ongoing, so if you do feel like you wish to continue the story the manga is the way to do it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Sep 19, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_aec1145295,16,1610
"I always wandered about Bleach and why is it so popular, now I see it. The first episode, admit it, kind of boring. And some people give up On whole thing, but don't! It really is amazing gets interesting every second. I spend night nonstop watching episodes, because I liked it so much. And never skipped a episode or dropped it once. Art-9: At fist art was shitty because it was just the begging, fuzzy and not high quality drawings. After a while it got much better, now is very hd. I would give it a 10 if the creator (Tite Kubo) wan't a pervert and draw giant breasts on every female character (not Rukia). Some characters are very interesting (arranacrs, hollows) and some clothes that characters wear are too revealing (Rengiku, Hallbel) Also a lot of male are attractive (Ichigo) Sound-10: I LOVE IT! the opening themes are fantastic! I don't listen to much closing themes. Because of Bleach I find my self in to Japanese music. Plus the sound effects are the best I ever heard. Whenever there is a battle EPIC MUSIC! Something funny happening, the music just adds and makes it more funny! And the best of all are the sad moment soundtracks. Whenever there is something sad happening, the soundtracks lead me to tears. It the best thing about bleach. Most of all when ""number one"" is playing, you know Ichigo is gonna kick ass. It makes me exited. Characters- 8: Could do better. That's the part where it makes me mad about bleach. Ichigo half shinigami and human, gets all this power. He gets stronger and kicks ass until he socks again! After he rescued Rukia, he all super strong and shit. But in the next arc he's all dam weak again.He gets strong, but then he becomes week again! It's like a cycle! It's kind of like, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU ICHIGO! YOU STINK! Too much about the main character, not enough concentration on the others. Ichigo seems like the only one getting stronger! Maybe some characters like Uryu and Rukia are gaining more powers. But still so dam week! In some battles they are so strong and awesome, in others they stink! It's like they got weaker! But I really love most of the characters. Accept Orehime who is constantly crying, so dam useless. And doesn't use her dam power at all! When ichigo is on his way to death all she can do is cry cry cry! The only use of her self she can make his her healing power! However she does encourage Ichigo to keep on fighting for her sake! But gets kidnapped and bullied by opponents stronger then her! Forget Orehime, there are also a lot awesome female characters, like Rukia, Yoruichi, Soi Fon and others. Dubbig-8.5 He dubs were great at first but over time the character voices changed. And to worse! They already changed awesome voice actors for Chad, Urahara and Kenpachi! All of them were awesome, now they sock! But I still love the main voice cast, Ichigo, Rukia. Orehime and such. And I think Johnny Yong Bosh was born to dub Ichigo! He does great job with the bankai, getsuga tenshoue, and ichigo's tone according to the mood. And Vic as Ikaku is bit a surprise, but as always he does an amazing job. I always preferred dubs over subs, and this one of them. So check out the dub first, maybe you might like it. Personally I do not like the sub voices. Plot/Story-9: could be better. Despite the fact most people don't like the plot I'm ok with it. In every arc Ichigo has to fight a a strong bad guy, and he gets stronger an so on. I don't see why people have a problem with the plot. The filler arcs are pretty interesting. And some filler episode are good too. I love the random amount of charters there are. Unllike Naruto with all ninjas. Bleach has all rendom characters (hollows, soul reapers, arrancars, bounts, quincy...) it's very interesting to know the ability of every character. Weapons-10: Like before very character has unique powers, and always fun to find out. Some might have a Zanpakuto, while others have a ceto, or doll, or reseraccion form. Shikai is when the owner finds out the name of his Zanpakuto it turns different shape and size. Ex: Rukia's Sode no Shiroyuki. Bankai or final release: is even a highher level, they become stronger, with all this awsome ability, even their clothes change. Ex: Byakuya's Senbonzakura Kagiyoshi. The fights are epic. With characters revealing there awsome abilities. But also predictable, Ichigo fights, he's good so far, then it seems like he's loosing then at the last moment he wins... Despite all of the complains and all the flaws Bleach has. For me it's my favorite anime serious ever. Few more things: Not much romance: There is no atrraction between Rukia and Ichigo, or Orehime and Ichigo, whatsoever!! But few cute scenes, and a possibly a confession. Enjoyment is 10 because since I watched I don't stop going. Something new and awsome happens in every episode. Overall 9: I have may other anime I could give a 10 to and might be better then bleach. But so far it's my favorite anime. Don't give up on this anime after one episode or just because elf fillers, if you do, you will be missing a lot of excitement. Give this anime a try at keat once, and don't listen to other people bitching about it being waste of time. Hopefully what I wrote make sense, and sorry if something is wrong with my English. Hopefully u will find this anime enjoyable, and this review helpful.",9,Recommended,"Mar 16, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d5837a0bff,16,5339
"when the name bleach is heard the thing that comes to mind is "" one does not simply not watch bleach "" but for some people ""bleach.........faggots faggots faggots who watche bleach is a faggot who made bleach is a faggot"" and keep going on for hours until they realize everyone already left. so for this reason i am writing this review for people who want to give bleach a try but there motivation is destoyed due to 'haters' to start with : story: must say the story is well thought and amazing. personaly i dont think of this as a perfect storyline which normaly hardcore fans do say but its not bad, actualy i really enjoyed it. the plot twists were great and i loved the soul society arc i was crazy for the next episode but as they say what goes up must come down. same happened when the annoying fillers released for eg the zampakto arc. the fillers were not that bad but it created distortions within the story and confused the viewer.but its not like they suck, some of these fillers sometimes made me hahahhahahahhah (why the haha cuz lol is to mainstream) so its still entertaining unless you are the new grumpy cat.i should have metioned it before but the first 20 episode are slow and are just introductry but i think its less then 20, any ways i gave the story a 9/10 art: amazing. the art was very pleasing to me the background the character designs were very well made and what bleach is most famous about is its battles. well they arnt the best but are one of the best the swordfights are simply mindblowing the way the animations were made of those epic scenes were well EPIC. but not just the battles the beautifully made zampaktos and their releases were amazing so for art i give a 9/10 sound: hmmmmmmmmm what should i say lets see.........FRIGGIN FANTASTIC.whenever a bleach episode started going downhill for me the music made me pumped up once again. i have seen many animes and most of them have the same problem the sound isnt in complete sync with the scenes let it be battle scenes or a let it be a conversation between characters some thing just didnt feel right. but when it comes to bleach the sound or background music is completely synced with the scenes.both were working in complete harmony.the voice actors for the characters were also well chosen and performed very well and they never gave me a chance to say ""you had one job!!!!!"" so the music department gets a full 10/10(but still not perfect) characters: the characters were well made and were great each character had a unique ability of their own which no other had and the biggest problem in various series is that the characters arnt well explained but bleach has no issue like this for me most of the characters starting from main to supporting all were well explained and had each had a diffrent storyline about their past (obviously). so for characters i behold a 9/10 my opinion: bleach is a great show to watch but since its one of the mainstream animes nowdays it has a lot of fans and haters and both actualy give a wrong opinion about the show the fans go on babbling that its a perfect show and the other animes go pale infront of it and they over exaggerate about the good points and hide all the cons while the haters do the opposite and hide all the pros and reveal the cons, but thats not very bad because a person who is about to make a journey through 366 episodes should know a lot about the anime before making the step but the haters usualy spice the cons. so what my advise is not to listen to some people and give the show a try trust me i really enjoyed it even though some people actualy discouraged me .and if u dont like it you can call it quits. overall i give it a 9/10 if u dont like the review please dont go nuts as this is my first review",9,Recommended,"Mar 28, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_f633013f07,16,3763
"Review 8: Bleach ( let's take a trip to the soul society) bleach is for one completely amazing in every way!!! If you don't like Naruto that much then i think this would suit you way more better. This is mainly about Soul reapers who live in the Soul Society in another realm. Soul Reapers: People who have either died or can see spirits. They have a Reaper form and a Human form in which they can disguise themselves. They fight Hollows to protect Humans and to keep peace in between the realms. Most of the higher ranked Reapers live in the soul Society and armatures live in the Human World. They're job is to protect the humans and try to get rid of Huco Mondo. Hollows: People who have been criminals in their unfortunate lives and have bad souls, they turn into Hollows once they have died. They try to attack other Humans to kill them and attempt to kill the Soul Reapers all of the time. They don't care about one another and have no emmotions apart from Anger, their hideous creatures who will be forever hunted down by the Soul Reapers. Soul Society: The place where all Soul Reapers will go during their life. Many live there many just come and go. In the surronding ares live the spirits of people who have passed away. The place is seperated in to the rich the middle class and the poor, it's all based on who lives there and what it is like there. Theres tons of different characters to meet along the way and it's a brilliant read and even better to watch as they've already finished doing the series even though theres over 9 different series but oh well! Try getting around to watching them all as they ar really cool and action packed, i've started watching it again. lol!!!

"What to say about one of the most popular fan based animes out there? Even if you aren't an anime fan chances are you've heard of Bleach. I was skeptical when I first decided to watch it, as I am some what of an animation snob. I have a heard time watching older animes because I liked the fresh vibrant colors of the newer more ""crips"" anime; but I got over it pretty quickly once the story line about a normal ghost seeing boy inherent the powers of a Shinigami and the adventures and problimamtic tasks they go through. Like most anime, there was lots of filler, and If I figured that out earlier I would have saved a lot of time, however if your into the filler type then this is a good anime for you, if not just do what I did and google online the full episode list and it will show you the fillers with no disruption to the actual timeline. On that note, I do feel like the Arrancar arc was a little dragged out but that also isnt my choice. If the battle scenes weren't literally like 5 episodes a piece then it probably would have been more enjoyable - but its worth it. Overall, the character development, the story lines, and the binds and feelings that come with this anime were all enjoyable and I would probably watch it again.",8,Recommended,"Aug 10, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_79177f6cad,16,1241
"This anime has a lot of episodes so be prepared for a long ride. The main characters are in high school and through odd circumstances end up mixed with a strange and cool characters called soul reapers. There is plenty of action and character building in this. They grow up and gain new powers and form bonds. The Soul reapers are a huge bunch and very different from one another that they stand out. The villains are unique and you get to explore a world not seen before. The little downside is that there is a lot of filler. For my part it was interesting but sadly didn't apply to the main story or was never carried over. The bounts were cool in my opinion. Try this anime if you like lots of action, great catchy music, interesting characters and villains.",10,Recommended,"Mar 14, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_78310a075d,16,761

"Bleach is basically the story of Ichigo Kurosaki, a normal human like you and me who meets a certain shinigami/soul reaper one day and helps them at their most helpless moment. He then gets the power of a shinigami and to that person's surprise, he is a natural at this. The story revolves around shinigami and other kinds of spirits which might not be totally original now but for sure one of my favorite themes ever for anime, There are always lots of potential for complex, deep, and exciting stories and bleach did well on most fields. The art and animation are overall really good, some people say it sometimes was bad and that they rushed the art but I never noticed a single example. I would give it a 9 simply because of the overall over-average-looking art and the effects used throughout the anime. The character design is astonishing, especially the MCs are impossible to forget and they are all really well thought. Each has their beliefs, strong and weak points and they all help each other with their friendship and trust. In conclusion, Bleach is an anime you must watch, it is really well made and it ain't a classic anime for no reason. Both the Story, Art, Music, Characters, and plot are all really good. And the anime just like the other big shounens I mentioned really change you fundamentally.It is still a shounen so don't expect lots of mystery or very intense and original stories, it is quite literally 4 arcs from the manga and like a couple of filler arcs most are about invading some enemy's base and saving a friend or something similar, poor but lots of fun and just legendary. It also has a bit of an issue with fillers that people hate but let's be real if you hate them that much go on animefillerlist and skip the fillers, which are 45% of the anime.",9,Recommended,"Dec 12, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_cecd10629c,16,1785
"Bleach has its highs and lows, especially if you watch the filler arcs. At some times you have bad fights with irrelevant characters that go on for several episodes and other times you have fantastic fights that have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The main villain is simply amazing, the protagonist is ok and other characters shine too ( I won't say any names to avoid spoilers).Since Bleach is old the animation isn't perfect but that does not mean that there won't be good fights, especially towards the end when the animation gets better. It is overall great and, but can be a drag sometimes (mainly in the fillers).

"Bleach is absolutely nostalgic for me, so if you're looking for something unbiased, then please take my opinion on the anime with a grain of salt. I never watched any anime other kids watched growing. Naruto? Not for me, never will be. Dragon Ball? Not that either, don't like the art, don't like the characters. One Piece? Oh, please, don't start with me, no single series deserves the amount of episodes One Piece has gotten, with an episode count like that I guarantee 75% of the series is uninteresting. Bleach was the first anime I ever watched as a kid (Other than some season 1 DVDs of Pokemon a friend gave me). I watched it with my dad, and was absolutely infatuated by Bleach. Its characters? Top notch. Its premise? Stunning. Its weapons and fights? Absolutely incredible. I watched until maybe a bit past the Ulquiorra fight first time around, and with my second watch through now I'm beginning to approach the same point, though this time I expect to finish the show before the release of the final arc later this year. Speaking of the final arc, you have no idea how ecstatic I am to hear they're finally giving the show I proper ending it deserves. If you don't know, the anime was cut off by Shonen Jump in the middle of several story lines and events, I guess it wasn't pulling the numbers Shonen wanted anymore. The show was given thirty episodes to completely wrap up everything the show had going on, which, with an anime sixteen seasons long, you can imagine is a lot to wrap up. As someone who's not even completed the Aizen arc, I can't attest to this personally, but apparently the ending is garbage because of the thirty episode deadline. The new arc is so exciting for me, not just because after I finish the show I'll be able to watch a proper ending to my favourite show of all time, but because it does Bleach justice, and it brings a show with such incredible potential for visuals when it comes to environments and fights and weapons, into a more modern era of animation where those potentials can be realized. But, this isn't a review of the upcoming arc, this is a review for 2004 Bleach. The story can be incredible at times, and, though I wouldn't say less incredible, sullied by its repetitive or generic nature at others. There are tropes that have been used for centuries, which aren't bad by any means, otherwise they'd never have been used for so long, but they are more boring than the more original and exciting parts of the story. Arc 1, pretty generic story wise, though its several generic characters that are used to make up the generic parts of the story are offset by the host of lovable and unique characters the series introduces. For every boring Rukia, there's an interesting shop of Urahara and his colleagues. The second arc doesn't just step up the genius and uniqueness of the show, it straight up launches it into the upper atmosphere where it floats for the entirety of the arc, with an entirely new scenery, a whole host of brand new and unique characters that triples the number of characters in the show overall, tonnes of incredible fights, as well as new and exciting abilities. Arc number three is a filler arc, no two ways about it. Its not part of the main story so none of the characters gain any new or exciting abilities, and nothing of lasting effect occurs. The beginning of the Hueco Mundo arc is where things get spicy again, at least you'd think. The entirety of the Hueco Mundo arc plays out like a spray painted Soul Society arc, a close friend is taken to an alien soul world where 13 enemies are strongest of the bunch (10 Espadas and the 3 defector captains, sounds pretty familiar, eh? Like the 13 captains of the 13 court guard squads?). The bosses of Hueco Mundo even mirror personalities of the captains of the court guard squads, so not only is the concept not unique, neither are the new characters. All that being said, the Soul Society (second) arc is probably the best arc in the entire anime, so its not necessarily bad that it was copied. The new captain Shusuke Amagai arc is a filler arc that interupts the Hueco Mundo arc half way through, with no lasting bearing on the rest of the show, important characters in the arc are either pushed aside afterward and don't have a position in the anime that would mean they'd have to show up later, or the characters that do have too much of an important role that they'd have to be seen after the arc is over end up getting killed to avoid that. After that arc it's back to Hueco Mundo where you get a whopping one short season until another filler arc begins explaining the origins of the Vizored. That's where I am now. My reviews of stuff always turn to the most negative things I can think of about that topic, but know that I don't review things unless they're very important to me. This is the show I spent days watching with my father, before I had a computer, before we had a streaming service, it was this show I'd always die of excitement for when I saw he brought another DVD back from the library. It's got its faults, but in my eyes the parts of it that are good outweigh and outnumber the parts of it that are bad, 100 to 1.",9,Recommended,"Apr 24, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ade854dc01,16,5173

So, lets talk about my expericente with this anime. I taken Bleach to watch one month ago, during my college vacation. One of my brothers watched and recommeded it for me several weeks ago. With 7 rest weeks, it was perfect chance to finally take Bleach. , but we have a powerful story here, emotional in several moments. Its great to see history details about all main and secondary cast without needed watching fillers seasons. Talking about cast, its a great ""world"" here, but not so huge/complex like Naruto or One Piece, to example. The best thing about story is the comebacks and big surprises during some arcs, awesome moments. The second best thing is the powerful protagonist. Ichigo Kurosaki have ""simple"" ambitions, fighting only to protect your friends and peoples. And, finally, the relationship Ichigo/Rukia is one of the bests i've seen. Its not a perfect anime, but is very great, and I hope to Pierrot take it back, because its totally possible.

"Honestly, I absolutely fell in love with all the characters in this series. There were very few characters from the main, manga-oriented arcs that I disliked. I have Tumblr blog dedicated to Bleach and Bleach alone because I love it so much. Yes, the story is all over the place. Yes, some of the battles were let downs. Yes, the ending was... questionable. HOWEVER, the character relationships and the phenomenal solo battles and the history of the Shinigami is enough to make anyone fall in love. Be warned: if you're looking for romance, this anime is not for you. It's very heavily a Shōnen anime. Although, that does mean you can have whatever character you want all to yourself... and the thousands of other fans that also fell in love with them. Listen, just watch it.

"This will be a quick review, which shouldn't have any real spoilers. My biggest criticism for bleach is it's filler, which is common for long running Shounen, but still effects the enjoyment of the series. The story starts off strong with a monster of the week style anime focusing on the MC first getting his powers into the soul society arc, which is probably still one of the best arcs that has come out of Shounen Jump to date. The following arc however goes downhill as the entire arc is basically filler, something about vampires, and not very enjoyable. The next few major arcs are kind of formulaic, following the same patterns as the first, which is still enjoyable, but not really anything revolutionary. The Aizan arc which was really the last important arc of the anime was also thoroughly enjoyable, and i remember watching it as it aired. It was basically the climax of the entire series, and it was pretty well done. The music choice in the series is pretty iconic, and the art style uses realistic human proportions (mostly). The one other major flaw i have to point out is the character development. When a character is introduced, the author makes sure you know who they are immediately by making them stand out, but most characters don't really get any attention or development after that aside from flashbacks. The MC has very little significant development, but is noticeably more mature from the beginning to the end of the series. I recommend that if you don't care about the filler, just skip it, there are plenty of lists on which episodes are actually part of the plot. If you haven't picked this anime up because it is too long, just do yourself a favor and watch through the end of Soul Society arc.",8,Recommended,"Jan 22, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_386ff1884b,17,1727
"To be honest , I am a little biased to bleach as it was my very first anime after a long time. Believe me the last anime I watched ,before bleach was Doramon in my THIRD grade. Thus my review can be a bit like a one made by a fanboy....but still let's just get on with it. Bleach is like your typical shounen manga where at first it seems like the protagonist got all these awesome powers by chance but further in the story it is revealed to be somewhat tied to the protagonist's past.Anyway the protagonist Ichigo is a normal highschool boy with normal ass friends. One day he meets Rukia Kuchiki, a shinigami who accidentally gives him her powers and from there on their journey begins. To be fair to bleach even if you hate it you cannot ignore the character designs, the scenery and the thought behind the story. Even if you think it should have stopped after the so called best arc i.e. "" the soul society arc"" you cannot help but be awe of the designs of the Espadas . The storyline may be cliché but some of the twists cannot be predicted if you are an anime only as I was at that time. And hey every storyline may be called cliché when compared to other stories before them.The fillers may be long and sometimes boring but some things do carry over to the main story .Also the fights are awesome to look at. And we also get fan service from a few characters. All in all bleach is a good anime for people who are looking for a shounen battle anime .It has its ups and downs but it is still good. So go watch it if you want to see a good anime .just give it a try. Just watch up to the soul society arc and then decide if you want to continue or not . BTW This is my first review as well . Tell me your opinions about bleach and this review. Buh-bye",8,Recommended,"Jan 28, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c585cc77e2,17,1755
"Bleach has been around for a long time. I remember hearing about it when I was watching scooby doo. (though, to be honest, I still watch/love scooby doo...). I am not usually a huge fan of anime that run FOREVER. D-Gray man was an amazing 130 ep series (and the new season starts soon!!!!!), and I had the same high hopes for bleach. The first 3 seasons of Bleach were the best. You can watch each season in one day or so and be happy. The 4th season was not terrible, but it did get very dry. If I was to rate the anime on the first 3 seasons, it would be story: 10, art: 8, sound: 7, character: 8, enjoyment: 10, overall: 9. My rec is to just watch the first three seasons, but you may like it more than I did. Pros: Storyline is decent. It touches on Shinigami, which is you ever saw death note, they are soul reapers. In bleach the have a lighter feel about them. The characters were both good and bad (good v evil anyone? no? ok...) but Ichigo was a character I liked the entire time. Cons: IT DRUG-ON FOREVER. It would seem like 10 episodes would go by of the same fight. Or the same problem. By the time you finally move on you're bored as hell. First 3 seasons kept you interested. But the rest of the story just got DRY. Had the series ended after season 3, I personally would not be offended. I'll let you be the judge. It is a good anime. Just not one of my favorites. -JNutt22 Edit: I finished the anime about a year after submitting this review. If they continue with another season (eventually) it'd better be like the first 3 seasons.",7,Recommended,"Jan 14, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_89da24e10a,17,1549
"Bleach is a very popular anime because its a shonen anime. This makes it immensely popular but not always in a great way. While Bleach starts off good, after the Soul Society Arc, it loses some of its charm. The filler episodes/arcs almost ruin in entirely. However some of the fight scene animations make up for it. Most of the music in Bleach is great and you will listen to it time and time again. At the beginning, it might get kind of confusing with all the squads, but you will get to know them soon enough. I give Bleach 8/10",8,Recommended,"Aug 21, 2010",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_bc278bb725,17,532
"Though considered to be in league with Naruto and One Piece as the three great Animes of the decade and beyond - it is commercially - initially it is a good anime one with depth, originality, and variation essential to every great anime, but as every anime of great length is prone too, it loses originality and becomes pointlessly predictable. The story initially takes an original stance on shinigami's and their cross-relationship with the human world. As the story progresses, the viewer becomes more and more enticed by the original settings and stunning plot twists, but as the plot reaches the ultimate climax many elements become re-used and thus lose originality and become unbelievably redundant. At this point around episode 320ish is where the conclusion should have been and despite the continuation is ultimately unsatisfying - I will not give any spoilers, for those who are looking to start the series. For those who read the manga and/or anime, the continuation past the Aizen arc is utterly pointless and redundant and ultimately drags down my overall enjoyment and rating of this series. It is the equivalent of a horrible filler and is again predictable. Despite my dislike for Bleach as of now, as I said I have fallen in out of love with this anime, but in the end I have decided to no longer watch and grown to hate Bleach; however, the animation is more realstic is comparable to the detail within Naruto and One Piece, the voice actors are nothing the best, and the artists who have composed the sound track for the anime is simply spectacutlar. I highly admire the strong string aesthetics embedded within the music, as it developes the mood, whether it be sad, intense, are thrilling. Far surpassing One Piece and Naruto in Sound.

"Bleach, Welcome to your over-popular mainstream Anime. I had to almost force myself watch this, the show seems like a lot of repetitive ideas and themes coming into place, whether our protagonist Ichigo has to fight Soul reapers, or protect his friends from Hollows. The show is just the same thing over again, a few weapon swings, some near death experience, and next morning everyone is friendly and unharmed. The characters are hardly in-depth, their back-stories are either cliche or weak. No matter how strong our protagonists get, the antagonist is always one step ahead, but with the power of friendship we can win! The story is long and feels dragged on, their is little to no development personality wise with our main character, Ichigo. The whole story is weak at best, flying monsters in the streets, and nobody knows. A whole other world that nobody can see or know about other than him, and his family. The animations are decent, nothing special. Quality work I suppose. The sounds are mediocre, again, nothing special. Characters made me sick, I'm tired of my main characters mom being dead, and I'm tired of them yelling about how they need to protect their friends. All the characters sides feel forced, I don't get to choose who is good or bad, they're set for me. I cant enjoy a show that drags on this long, they are milking a cow. Overall, 7. It's tolerable, however I would never watch it again, so it's not enjoyable for me.",7,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7a6ccb655d,17,1446
"Bleach started with an interesting concept. The basis is really around the three coexisting worlds (The mortal realm, Soul Society, and Hueco Mundo) and the two spirit world's interactions with the mortal world. The Shinigami and their Zanpakuto make for both interesting character development and an excuse for the artists to make some dazzling and flashy fight scene. The characters themselves are diverse and make for some interesting interactions. The problem with the show that many people, including myself seem to agree upon is the plot line. The initial story arc (Soul Society) and Ichigo Kurusaki's clash against the Gotei 13 contains some great storytelling, compelling character development, and inspiring fight scenes. The apparent lack of true evil in Ichigo's opponents makes it at the more interesting, being a fight between personal justice and the uncompromising law of soul society. If i were judging Bleach based upon just this part of the story I would be giving it much higher score. From this point onwards i begins to go down. As the lines between good and evil become less blurred and the true enemy surfaces the story gets drawn out further and further without really adding any substance to the characters or the plot. It becomes a cycle of fight scenes that are all pretty much the same main-plotlne and filler arcs alike.",7,Recommended,"Dec 7, 2009",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e15082a434,17,1350
"Do you like power scales that are as confusing as the movie Mulholland drive? Then you'll probably love this blockbuster shounen. The big three of Naruto, Bleach and One piece are now pretty dead. Bleach is done with no real answer as to whether they will return to finish animating the manga, Naruto is just about over since the Manga is finished, and One piece is about as good as John Wayne Gacy was at being a birthday clown. Naruto, which mainly suffered from story that seemed to have been created along the way and terrible animation later on, and One piece, which suffered from goofy over the top characters and storylines, are nice contrasts to Bleach, which instead, suffers from terrible fillers and even worse power scales. Power scales are very random, and in the case of Ichigo, all it takes is 20 episodes to become stronger than someone who is waay stronger than him, and someone who later beats people much stronger than ichiho, but you're like, ""okay, ichigo beats strong guy but he was weaker, strong guy is strong, barely beats someone who beats ichigo, but ichigo beat him, then strong guy is even stronger, loses to someone weaker than ichigo"" and so on & so on, until you're pulling your hair and wishing someone erased all your memories of Hunter x Hunter so you can rewatch the proper, logical power scales. Leaving aside the power scales for a moment, the plot, which is about as ridiculous as Chris Tucker was in the 5th element, was repeatedly stabbed by fillers. Fillers everywhere. I mean, I think at one point, There was about 40 episodes of filler in a row. I remember not watching the show for about 5 months, and coming back, and the filler was just at its climax. Do you know how long five months is? That's one college semester. 1 shitty relationship. about 18 paychecks. About 350 cumshots & about 1 stephan Hawking speech. It's a long time. The story itself, unlike Naruto, did not create upon itself(though the manga now is a different matter), and was very entertaining. I mean, there's about as many plot holes as there are contradictions in the bible, but boy, Jesus is just so cool yanno? Characters are super cool, and mostly unique, especially considering the different powers everyone has. I mean, in Naruto, there could be like 20 guys who have the same exact power(fire for example) but In bleach, it's pretty unique. Ichigo, our main, is cliche, but he's not as much of a bitch as Naruto was, and gets shit done when he needs to, so there's that. He's still about as predictable as every other main shounen character so don't expect a mona lisa here. & yes, yes, Inoue, the heroin(and I use that term loosely, much like Marsha May's pussy has to be by now) is about as bumbling and as useless as they come, and really just a over the top sexualized character with the personality of a carebear. But her tits are bigger than the death star & I would pay about 1,000,000 prussian franks just to see her animated and fucked. Just remember, don't expect the characters to be amazing. Just focus on their fights and powers and less on their ideals. The art keeps constant, which is very good, and the animation never falters & You will see some of the best animated fights in a shounen you have ever seen. I mean, they are fucking nuts good sometimes. Better than the fucking taco bell box for 5 dollars. The sound also is very well done, and they have some really good ost's and some badass chanting style latin shit, and that stuff always gets me hard (Think Monster theme, or Halo fight music). Endings and openings are memorable, and mostly always good. Whether it's AKFG or Aquatimez or Orange range, you'll more than likely love the music as if it were a fucking corgi-husky mix. Overall: Enjoyment level is enjoyable. Like the fast and the furious movies. But for the love of god, don't you fucking dare try to analyze this shit anime or you will end up with a headache that rivals a jaegar induced hangover or attending a seminar on string theory.",7,Recommended,"Nov 4, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_1a91dba39a,17,3999
"When everything is said and done, Soul Society arc was and still is peak shounen. Everything that followed was not as good. Taken as a whole, Bleach has a lot of glaring weak points and is deserving of some of the flak it gets. However, it definitely deserves its place as one of the most important anime of all time. I love the worldbuilding, the epic battles, the attention Kubo paid to character design, THE MUSIC, the memorable scenes and quotes.

"Bleach isn't all bad. Ichigo is actually a pretty good MC. He's a cool guy and didn't whine and bitch all the time. Great. There are a lot of great, interesting characters throughout the show. Watching them grow and progress was pretty cool. Some of the arcs were initially interesting but dragged on for way too long and got really boring. The number one thing this show suffers from is the ""Ha! You shouldn't have underestimated me and turned your back on a presumed dead opponent"" trope. A lot of shounen have this problem, but Bleach does it more than any show I've ever seen. If you're kinda iffy about the show but have somehow made it past episode 300 or so, the last arc is absolutely worth it. For me it brought the show from a 5-6 up to a 7.

This is my first review on this website I have only been watching anime for probably about a half of year but I do not understand why this anime is to popular. If you like it good for you but this anime can be summed up into one sentence. this anime is like my English papers 50% filler and 50% actual content I really wish I was trying to be funny I am serious I found myself skipping 10 episodes and nothing interesting has actual happened and the pacing of this show is brutally slow I found myself yelling at my computer screen saying come on already. and once I actual got to the fighting scenes it wasn't even worth it the amount of bullshit and time I wasted waiting for a lot of good action wasn't even worth it. I have a feeling this would be a good show if there wasn't so many fucking episodes. now the characters To be blunt there was almost no memorial characters they were basically NPCs. very little to no character development. and dont give me the bullshit I have to watch a certain amount of episodes to review it properly I have watch 75 episodes and I have shit to do with my day besides watching anime.

But as for the people who did get that far. You all know what happened to Ichigo after the whole Aizen thing. I don't think that should have happened. But it did make it pretty interesting.

"Bleach is one of the 'three main anime'. Personally it is my favourite but that is mainly based on the nostalgia (as I watched it when I was younger). A lot of people dislike the show, but I believe that is mainly down to the fact of *cough* 'the too cool for mainstream' *cough* attitude, and ""I'm a hardcore anime watcher, I don't watch any 'entry level anime'""... Or the fact people prefer Naruto or One Piece. Story 8/10 The story has a LOT of plot twists, they will always leave you wanting to watch the next episode and procrastinate the next hour of sleep. However, it can get bland in some places - this is purely because the large amount of episodes the arcs are spread across. I believe the first arc is around 60 episodes so if around 3-4 episodes are dedicated to one fight you might get a little bored if you're more interested in seeing the plot develop and what not - this is the only reason I gave the story an 8/10 instead of a 10/10. As for fillers, they are pretty random but enjoyable. Sometimes they sort of copy the main arcs when it comes to the layout but if you watch it; it's not that noticeable and some fillers you might decide to skip. Art 9/10 Because of the sheer length Bleach has been running you'll find the art style changes throughout. At first the art is more simplistic yet it adds a great comedic effect and really suits the characters' personalities. After the first arc or so it starts to have a more complex design and the animation gets a lot better so if you decide you like the show but don't exactly like the quality at first I definitely recommend you keep watching as it gets so much better. Sound 10/10 The soundtrack is brilliant and diverse. It varies throughout to suit the different arcs however there are some constant tracks you will notice throughout. The voice acting is great as well; it suits the characters and I don't think you'll find any voices particularly annoying. However I found the english dub rather annoying when it came to Orihime and Kon's voices. Character 10/10 Almost every character in Bleach gets their own backstory and some times even a whole episode is dedicated to them. The character development throughout is great, you'll almost feel like you know them. You may get a little confused about if a character is good or bad at times. Enjoyment 9/10 I really enjoyed Bleach. The only thing that brought it down for me was the lengthly arcs and some really random fillers but I find it added to it's uniqueness in a way. Overall 9/10 Bleach may not be everyones cup of tea but if you like animes with a diverse universe (hehe rhymes) then I recommend you try it. Oh and I may sound over positive, I'm not a supa kawaii fangirl (sarcastic use of kawaii, yes?) I just have an odd writing style.",9,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_610d8deac7,17,2771
"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILER FROM ANIME AND MANGA && My own theories about some unexplained things in anime/manga ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is an anime with great potential which Wasn't used in 80% but this is still good in my opinion , and worth to watch it . For the first time when You watch the story it seems to be really low and maybe predictable but If you will read the story in manga and then rewatch at lest once the full anime of Bleach you will see that the story has more thinks which are so creative and explained/unexplained. But before saying the whole story in this universe there are at least 4 worlds which are connected with each other so we have there of course the Realistic World ( i don't know how to call it ) with the people living there , Karakura city etc. We have also Soul Society the home of Shinigamis (Death Gods ) and also ( only in manga is being shown ) The King Soul's Palace/castle( I don't remember the pro. name of this place ) in which lives The king of soul society and also the unit Gotei 0. And the last known world is Hueco Mundo in which are living the fallen spirits(bad spirits ) Hollows(with their evolution tree). 8/10 Story is simple and the beginning of the entering the new World ( without the King Souls world ) is a kidnapp of Kurosaki's friends. We have at beginning the Arc in which Kurosaki Ichigo is meeting Kuchiki Rukia and gets the Shinigami powers and learning with us also who are the shinigamis who are the hollows and the basics about the rules . Then Rukia is being kidnnaped and we Begin the Soul Society Arc . After fighting-getting strong - fighting losing - getting strong etc. We have information about the ""Hollow"" inside the Ichigo and also about the shinigamis real powers/politics etc. Then we Begin the Arrancar/Visared arc with betrayal of 3 Captains of Soul Society which is the longest . Then we have the Fullbring arc which in my opinion shouldn't be in Bleach universe . In manga we have also the Quincy arc ( Thousand blood war ) . 9/10 Art . This anime is (right now when I am writing it ) a little old , but the art is still nice , the style of drawing the main characters ( without any special colours of hairs , hairstyle and dunno like in meme "" Find a main character "" ) and also the style of look like of Shinigamis , hollows , visared , arrancars , quincys and the others . 10/10 Sound. This anime has a lot of masterpieces some soundtracks people who doesn't seen bleach knows and doesn't know that these osts are from Bleach . Like Treachery , Stand up be strong , Invasion , Fade to black ( there 2 nice ost but the fade to black has names B(number) which I don't remember ) and a lot more of them also the openings themes are really nice the genre similar to rock without any slow songs like Velonica , Ranbu no Melody , Alones , Chu-Bura and more . 10/10 Character . In this anime when we will take every character from every arc(including the manga last arc) and also all fillers there are a lot of original characters and also in overall we will hate/don't like ( in my opinion ofc . ) something like 2-8 characters . Every one is original the main characters Ichigo , Inoue , Sado, Ishida , Rukia and Renji , the captains of soul society , arrancars , bountos , zanpakutous , quincys and more ... 10/10 Enjoyment , Excluding the episodes in which there happens nothing you should enjoy this anime If you really like Shounen and action anime , there are alot of action and fights , also a lot of Sword fights and the originals ""Shikai"" ""Bankai"" and the ""Ressurection "" or ""Wandenreich powers"". Theories and my opinions : Fillers which doesn't succ. Why I think fillers aren't that bad as we think , just look at the ""Fillers arcs"" the bounto one isn't that bad is explained really nice we see there are more people with unusual powers not only Quincys , Inoue and Sado. Also the arc with ""New 3rd unit captains "" isn't that bad but it also isn't good , it's only to watch for a dinner time . The arc with revolution of Zanpakutous also isn't that bad because we can see the personalities and looks likes of the alot of Zanpakutous which we haven't seen in anime and also in manga. I don't know that the people who has read the manga noticed but in Soul Society probably is a really bad education of the next Shinigamis ""soldier"" in units. Because as you can see Rukia in anime said that she only know about Gillians Menos Grande from a books and she didn't know about any Adjuchas or Vasto Lorde . A lot of people doesn't know , Hirako Shinji or even Isshin Shiba from the past history of Soul Society which show how bad education is there , cause none of shinigamis(excluding some captains ) in anime recognise Hirako and also Rukia didn't recognise the Ichigo's father who was the Captain of the 10th unit . How shinigamis and everyone can "" fly "" in anime ( or maybe in manga also ) I think the reason was shown in anime but the people didn't connected this with the World of humans and Soul Society or even with Hueco Mundo as you remember when Ichigo , Ishida and Sado was going trhough the Garganta to Hueco Mundo they had to put heir own Reiatsu to make ""floor"" on air or something similar to vacuum , probably in this connect world "" Garganta "" is easier to make this floor than in Karakura city or in others world's because there isn't probably a strong atmosphere so probably in Karakura city in Soul Society or Hueco Mundo you can ""fly "" by putting your reiatsu under your feets like in Naruto with walking on water . Why only shinigamis died ? As you know from the beginning in anime in universe of world there should ""die"" without possibility of going to Soul Society only the Shinigamis , Bountos , Hollows killed by Quincys and also the victims of Bountos . But why ? That's easy Every human and quincy ( quincy are the humans with unusual powers ) after death they are the spirits with the chain from their body and waiting to be ""accepted / funeraled "" by shinigami or they will become Hollow ( by being eaten or just because of saddnes to some place/world/people) The hollows ( excluding in 100% Uluquiorra ) which got killed by Shinigami should being extracted and become as a normal human spirits to Soul Society and there is starting my theory about the Gillians/Adjuchas/Vasto Lorde /Arrancars after deaths spirits , because theye are a mix of they are mix of the hollows / some of them during evolution changed their own personality etc. so probably after death they can being as a New Human spirit ( which hasn't lived as a Real Human ) to Soul Society , so for par example Starrk or other Arrancar after death should appear in Soul Society as Starrk and arrancar but without hollows power , hole in body and also the hollows masks. The theory which ofc isn't a theory Why Ichigo has 3 powers ? Why I said 3 powers because I am not including in ""powers"" the fullbring because You can learn it , and it's nothing unusual , and also a ""Human"" isn't a power . Shinigami is mixed with Hollow power which we will get information about it in Manga , the Shinigami power is from his father , and the hollow also from his father but he took the Hollow ""White"" from his mother body(inner world) And also you can see that Zangetsu is a Hollow-Zanpakutou because the ""White Ichigo"" is a realy Zangetsu with his hollow powers ( in anime he told it but in other way cause Hichigo said that he is fighting with ""Elder Zangetsu "" about the place in his inner world ) and the last 3rd power is of course the Quincys powers which Ichigo has by blood like the Shinigami powers , because his mother was a Quincy. Also we can think that not only Ichigo in Kurosaki family can has these 3 powers but Karin and Yuzu too . About Kazui we already know it that he has at least unusual shinigamis powers. Next Generation are much mor over powered than the old. There is only one chapter about 2 children Ishika( if I remember well ) and Kazui , they are kids of coursy but you can see clearly that they are in at least lieutentant level . Look Ishikai has at least his sword in Shikai form which is typical to being an one of the officer's/lieutentant in a unit , and also Kazui which has probably also in ""shikai"" form the sword but it can be in ""Bankai"" form because his sword's handle looks like the same as the handle of the Ichigo's False Tensa Zangetsu and also it can explain why his Shinigami Kimono is unusaul which seems to be ""burning"" around the Kazui body .",10,Recommended,"Feb 10, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5f40a64cf5,17,8529
"This anime is an odd one, so lets jump straight into this pool of death and decay. Bleach had potential (and still has if it ever gets the Dragonball Kai treatment), the first few seasons were great, all of which have to do with the Soul Society (further more called SoSo by me, because SS might be a bit to offensive) and Ichigo's struggle against the hollows, which are evil spirits who have holes in their body (The show quickly explains why so I will not do it). The SoSo is where people go when they died, not exactly heaven, but you do not age, have hunger and no pain. The SoSo is protected by shinigami/reapers/soul reapers, who are the collectors of lost souls. Ichigo is a ""normal"" teenage punk, with the exception that he can see spirits, he deals with it better then I would. One day his family gets attacked by a hollow and almost get saved by areaper called Rukia, who gives her powers to Ichigo, who then becomes a reaper and kicks some ass with a giant sword. The rest of the story will be told by me like a speeding train, so no details. Rukia gets captured, Ichigo loses his powers, regains them with a friendly shopkeepers help, learns to activate the swords secret power, goes to the SoSo, fights normal reapers, number 3's, lieutenants and my favorite character of the show Ken-chan, unlocks the more secret power of his sword (bankai), tries to save rukia, fight, fight, fight, reveal of the big evil guy! And then the story goes down the hill of decent to ""lets have a tournament"" level (Same amount of effort put into it, no actual tournament takes place) and loads of fillers will take place (the only filler worth a damn is the beach episode). The fights though go slightly uphill though. Now lets get back to Ken-chan, Ken is the character that got me to sit through 366 episodes (including the filler), because when he is on the screen you know something will go down. When he fights, he laughs and it is contagious as the common cold. My second favorite character from the show was Retsu Unohanna and I have no idea why, she just has an aura that gives me enjoyment. So overall it becomes a 6, in my opinion a story and the characters are the most important aspect of an anime and the main characters stop being interesting and quick too. If the fillers were out of the picture it would overall be a 7. So lets hope that in 7 or 10 years we will have something like ""Bleach, yes we took the fillers out, 2022"".",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_b39e878f93,18,2439
"Bleach: One of the mainstays of the shounen genre. Bleach's contribution to popular culture cannot be argued. It's quality, however, definitely can. Even before I became a gigantic anime weeb a few years ago, I had heard about Bleach. It was always right up there with Naruto, One Piece, and Fairy Tale in terms of easily recognizable animes. Bleach has it's fair share of good points. The cinematography is pretty good, the voice acting is incredible (in the sub at least), and the OST's are high quality. The show also does an acceptable job in terms of character development (other than the main character, who get's a ton of development). It's nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. I've had a few problems throughout the life of the show that I think are worth pointing out. First off, the length. I've generally found that throughout my anime experiences up until now, length can be a significant contributing factor to how enjoyable the end product is. Obviously, how much the length affects a series depends on a variety of factors, namely genre and story pacing. For example, if Show A is a comedy/slice of life with no complex plot, you will be more likely to have success with a smaller length than you would with Show B, an action/adventure with an ensemble cast and heavy character development. Even after taking this in to consideration, I just found myself loosing interest in Bleach more often that I expected. It can get hard to watch a show when you need to watch 30 episodes before seeing anything significant happen. What can I say, I'm just impatient that way. Bleach was just too lengthy for me. Another concern I ended up having with the series was the overly cyclical plot. After a couple arcs, once the novelty of the series had worn off, I found the same cycle repeating itself. Step One: The main character gets destroyed by a powerful opponent, Step Two: The main character develops an awesome new power, Step Three: The main character barely beats the same opponent in a long, drawn out battle, Step Four: Repeat. The show did a decent job of making the fight scenes somewhat suspenseful (mostly done by trying to make us hate the villains by giving them all uniquely irritating personalities), but in the end you knew what the result was going to be. Finally, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the filler arcs. Oh the filler. Wow the filler. SO. MUCH. FILLER. I kid you not, 45% of Bleach is filler. Why so high? Well.... mainly because of the fact that the producers were repeatedly catching up with the author, Tite Kubo, and they apparently felt that it would be better to show terrible, meaningless filler just to keep milking the fans for money, rather than take a break for a while to preserve the integrity of the show. Is anyone going to stop watching Attack on Titan just because it took a break so the manga could get ahead? No. What I would recommend is looking up a filler arc guide before starting the series, so you can be ready to skip the filler. If you are absolutely insistant upon watching the filler, please limit yourself to only watching the Gotei 13 Arc (eps 317-342). It was, in my opinion, the only filler arc worth watching. Overall, decent show, way overrated, not for everyone. Give it a shot though. Regardless of it's shortcomings, Bleach is something everyone should experience.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jul 14, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3f6ac86152,18,3343
"This will be ridden with personal bias. I will do everything in my power to explain that bias so as to best relay exactly why I feel the way I do, but I can't say I'm terribly apologetic if my values do not coincide with yours. Bleach's strong suits became very apparent in the earliest stages of its existence; the stellar fight choreography, creative and dark designs worked around it, and tasteful themes managed a level of accessibility that was pretty impressive for its 'type' of shounen. The characters didn't show any kind of excessive depth, but really it never became anything too consequential, since at this point the immersion of the world (which, very interesting as a concept, at least at this stage) carried nicely. As the Soul Society Arc began to open up, almost everything got an overhaul; more (and better) fight sequences, an immersive setting, and an overarching plot that held everything together so precisely it hurt a little. This was, as I see it, when the show was at it's peak, having set up these set of circumstances nicely and allowed itself the liberty to play out and focus on what it did best. , of course, but as all the elements of this arc began to draw together, it set up one of the best finales of its time, plain and simple. It was an amazing display of long-term writing and concise story-telling, and was it not for the obvious set-up it established, I'd have been entirely satisfied with the series concluding there. However, it kept going, and as it did the issues with the anime began to show. That focus the seasons prior showed to where exactly the series was headed was no longer apparent, showcased no better than by a blatant rip of Vegeta and Nappa's descent to Earth established in the very opening of the Arrancar arc. The events proceeding felt more like segues to the next fight sequence than they did development of a greater plot, and coincidence seemed to drive far more elements than one might like. Furthermore, as the character cast began to expand and receive more time for development, Tite Kubo's lack of depth as a character writer began to show, with more and more one-note antagonists began to pop up. The plot now felt much more tied to convention than before, which sliced into what was a real strong-suit of the more liberal, previous arc. It was at this point that I think fans began to see the writing on the walls, and while many would still follow it on the merit of still-solid fight sequences and decent atmosphere, a lot of what made the series great had been lost. The filler arcs and the ""canon"" proceeding the Arrancar arc were acting extensions of the issues previously established; as the lore of the world expanded, the tone and portrayal of it all did not, leaving a gap of uncertainty that really cut into the overall immersion of the anime. Kubo has been trying to intertwine similar elements of his early successes into his proceeding arcs (significantly the ideas of in-fighting between factions), but none of them really tend to go anywhere, which is upsetting for someone who saw it done so well by that very person. In spite of all the negatives I note with this anime, I feel strongly that it does have a lot of enjoyable qualities to it, and I'd argue that the Soul Society arc is something of a modern masterpiece. It is heavily overrated for sure, but there is an obvious appeal to aspects of it, and if you can forgive the plot contrivances and somewhat underwhelming character focus in the later bits, then Bleach can be a pretty fun watch.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 7, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_198847fee4,18,3538
"Subjective in my opinion - 8/10 The theme is good, about the god of death. - 10/10 The organizational system is very clear, in my opinion this bleach has the clearest organizational structure of the anime I've ever watched. - 8/10 The skill system is clear and explained in detail - 7/10 The plot is ordinary, the pattern of fighting, defeat, victory, extra skills after the fight - 8/10 The usual MC character (naive as usual) - 9/10 The introduction of each character and skill is very clear. - 9/10 The MC portion is good, the story runs parallel and is not too excessive in highlighting the MC. - 9/10 Good visuals, considering the year it was published, in my opinion bleach is one of the anime with the best visuals.",9,Recommended,"Sep 18, 2024",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_ffd2300e93,18,722
"This show had a lot of potential with interesting characters and plots. However, it became more and more filler including even a few seasons entirely of irrelevant filler content. On top of that, the lines and fight scenes were ridiculously repetitive. The fighting became absurd as the show went on. When the main character acted cool and made the fights interesting, the fights would end abruptly and the show would become intensely boring again. Truly what killed this show was the seasons of pure filler. The entire series ended on a filler season as well. Many things went unexplained while having infinite time to cover irrelevant topics and characters that would be thought up and erased in the same filler season. It had its moments, but the were few and far between.",4,Not Recommended,"Jun 7, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a675d769b9,18,775

The mc looks the same as well, but one of them is a ginger??? The overall plot for this anime is really confusing, just like in the manga copy, the characters that had the name Ichigo were crazy overpowered!! With the amount of plot armor he has 6235 years would pass before he breaks a fucking nail. Baited shitter, I bet u thought something competent would be behind that read more tab.

"I'm someone who tries to enjoy everything but let me tell you right now, you won't get any enjoyement from this anime if you have above a room temperature IQ and I'm talking in celcius here. The first 3 seasons are decent to even quite good. The story makes sense, it's pretty fluid, the characters have logical development and the power scale mostly makes sense. Once that first main storyline is over though, everything gets out of hands. Orihime and Rukia became damsel in distress for most of the anime and both were pretty useless throughout the whole thing. Before anyone mentions how Orihime can heal people, nobody needs that in Bleach. We've seen many characters time and time again on the brink of death and yet all of a sudden they'd get a pokemon evolution on the battlefield and it would regenerate all their spirit energy. This leads to another major complaint, plot armor. The mangaka must have had no vision for his story because he kept writing himself into a corner and instead of thinking things through and trying to fix his many mistakes, everything has always been fixed by plot armor which makes the whole anime illogical if illogical things happen all the time for no good reason. The one saving grace of shonnen usually is the fights but if that's what you're here for, sorry to disappoint but you won't get that here either. The power scale is wack, the power ups don't make sense, training is non-existent, those power ups happen when they need plot armor to save them in the middle of a fight they weren't ready for. Also, if anyone is like me and never liked how all of Naruto's attacks are rasengan-like, Ichigo is worse because all he has is his rasengan. The battles are boring and uninspired. Another big issue is the pacing. Every other minute there is what they try to portray as an ""'epic"" moment with a lot of look backs, quick cuts, slow motion, etc. but if every scene is epic then none is. The whole styling of battles is just terrible. I recommend Black Clover, Shield Hero, Re Zero, HxH and The Promised Neverland if you wanna watch some quality.",2,Not Recommended,"Aug 7, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3fd3a6520b,18,2088
"Bleach, one of the three biggest Shounen of the 2000s Decade. I remember seeing this on Toonami when I was sixteen years old. Now, as 26 (soon to be 27 in a few days) I look back at the anime that has actually changed my life (since it made me interested in Anime and Manga) STORY: 6/10 Bleach has up and down moments with the story. As I try my best not to give anything away. There is a boy named Ichigo Kurosaki, a normal teenager (a reminder that several of the main characters ages are 15 with not looking 15 at all) gains Shinigami Powers and gets into a lot of messes with his friends and a group called the Gotei 13. Bleach first 60 episodes are a definite watch, in fact, it's probably one of the best Shonen Arcs of all time. And I'm not being a fanboy, being objective, it does all the stuff except pacing (not even bad) great. Possibly 9/10 rating IMO. After that, it goes downhill because it's basically a repeat (same thing in Manga too) of the same arc. Lacking any creativity. It's still entertaining as hell. The Fights and Animation are BEAUTIFUL (Bleach 60 fps is some of the best things I have watched in Anime.) Not to mention the constant fillers (45% of it is Filler) brings it down. The story could have been better, but Tite Kubo decided less originality and constant deus ex machinas. ART: 8/10 Although the Artwork in the Manga isn't good at all (""White Backgrounds there! And there! EVERYWHERE HA HA""-Tite Kubo), the animation is amazing. Better than Naruto, One Piece, Gintama, Fairy Tail, etc. for sure. Most consistent too. Like I said, watch 60 fps Fights, you're jaw is going to drop. SOUND: 10/10 It's Shiro Sagisu, what do you expect? Cometh The Hour, Invasion, Will of Heart, etc. still listen to this day. CHARACTER: 5/10 WHY KUBO? WHY???? WHY IS ICHIGO EVERYTHING? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.- You when/if you finish this anime. OMG, I cannot stress to you how many wasted characters are in this anime. Trust me, don't expect any but Ichigo, Uryu, Renji, Rukia, and Orihime to get a lot of screentime. That being said, Characters aren't bad or anything, it's just they're wasted. Bleach has a large cast, and Kubo made sure that you would be able to connect with at least one, and it's awesome of how he does that. There are little Background stories and the Villains come off of just being there to be your Saturday Day Cartoon Villains (except ones like Aizen and Ulquiorra lol) Overall, like the story, it could have been better, but it's what we got and you can enjoy it or hate it. ENJOYMENT: 7/10 You like Battles? Must watch. Do you like Adventure? You can watch. Do you like Romance? NOT HERE unless if you're a typical Shounen shipper Do you like Badass Characters? Must watch. Do you like DBZ with Swords? Must watch. You Like Great Stories and Characters? Eh, for 60 episodes at least but drop it. OVERALL: 7/10 It's better than Naruto for sure, but it still falls under the ""Classic Shounen Anime Syndrome"" This show had so much potential, but it fell flat, but it's still worth watching and even buying. Hope this helped you.",7,Recommended,"Dec 11, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_982d94fcea,18,3066
"NOTE: While I have seen the entirety of bleach (fillers included) many years ago, I am only formally writing a review for the first three seasons (aka 2 arcs) of bleach since I and most of the fanbase agrees that is when the show was at its best. I remember getting into bleach after I had been into DBZ and Naruto for a while. The show hooked me instantly with its dark and grim esthetic and the characteristics of the world. At that moment, I think I realized that anime could be dark, violent, and bloody (although bleach isn’t that violent or bloody compared to anime I watched later). The core things which hooked me on bleach was its brash main character ichigo, the characteristics of the world, and the unique system of powers. Ichigo appeals to me even today by being a character that knows how to fight, who speaks his mind whenever he wishes, and stands up for what he believes. It is a characteristic that most great shounen protagonists share. As a character, he connects with me instantly when I see him struggle to protect his family from hollows who want to devour them. The way Ichigo gets his power to protect those he loves from hollows also sets up his relationship with Rukia, who is arguably the character Ichigo is closest with over the course of the show. It is interesting to see how Rukia connects with him and convinces him to gradually adopt the role of soul reaper even though he is unwilling at first. One thing that makes bleach unique, at least for the time, was the fact that the story took place in the human world. This makes it more identifiable to the viewer. The characters are also more relatable in some ways than other shounen characters. Ichigo is a malcontent who is consistently getting into fights and walks around with a scowl on his face. He doesn’t act this way for no reason though. He has suffered loss in the past and him becoming a soul reaper largely represents him trying to make up for that past loss. Rukia has to learn to rely on Ichigo and contend with her own helplessness in the face of hollows when her powers disappear. Chad, despite his extensive strength, only fights to protect others. Uruyu holds resentment against the soul reapers due to past injustice but has to gradually learn to work together with Ichigo despite him being something he despises. Otohime does lack significantly in terms of character backstory and development, but she is at least a nice character and has some fun goofy, bubbly moments which make her likeable enough. The first arc of the anime largely acts as a sort of the monster of the week format. However, it doesn’t get tiresome because each episode gradually reveals more information about the world and characters. There are even moments of genuine emotion such as where Ichigo has to confront a key aspect of his past. This first arc also helps to establish strong bonds between the characters which become significant in the second arc. The second arc is where the show really picks up. Rukia gets kidnapped to the soul society and Ichigo and his friends have to rescue her. This is where the show introduces the concept of the soul society, its politics and structure, and the zanpakto. As stated by a youtuber named super eyepatch wolf in his video “The fall of bleach”. This arc of bleach seems to represent the period of emerging adulthood where teens are thrown into the adult world and have to work to understand it. In many ways, the soul society represents a society bound by tradition, rigid hierarchy, and harsh punishment. When Rukia is at risk for punishment by this society, Ichigo seeks to save her, thus rebelling against the structures he himself is supposed to be a part of as a soul reaper. Part of what makes this arc particularly great is that there is a large degree of mystery, intrigue, and uncertainty. Going in, the viewer and characters are aware they are going to be facing entire armies of people and individuals with unbelievable power. Unlike many other shounen anime out there, we often see characters lose fights, afraid of death, overcoming extensive odds, etc. Many times, the viewer isn’t even sure how fights will go. The fights in this arc are top notch. While the concept behind bleach isn’t completely unique, I love how each soul reaper has a unique power and it influences their fighting styles. The fights in this arc are some of the best in the whole series such as: Ichigo vs Kenpachi, Ichigo vs Byakuya, Uduyu vs kurotsuchi, etc. Even while all these fights are going on, there is still a ominous subtext in the show such as growing suspicion over a murder, conspiracy, hidden villans, etc. This arc is great because it expanded significantly on the first, added in a large diverse cast of characters, fleshed out the world, power system, character backstories and relationships, and threw in a couple of good twists. At its core, the first 60 episodes of this show was about Ichigo’s life being dramatically changed, him becoming close friends with a variety of characters, and risking his own life to save his friend. Even beyond that, the show becomes so much more. Even while rewatching the show, I was still binging it to get to the great fights and plot twists. To this day, it is still one of the most solid arcs I have seen in anime. While it is disappointing that bleach dramatically fell off after this arc with rehashed story lines, once dynamic characters becoming static, extensive filler, and increasingly absurd fights, I still treasure the first 2 arcs of this show. This is when the show was at his best. I still remembered the OST even after not watching bleach for many years. I never skipped the first opening. I remembered every character’s name and abilities. If bleach had ended after this arc, I think it would have been held up as an all time great instead of a infamous example of filler and lack of development. The relationships between characters still hook me to this day and I can look back at these arcs as moments of great unadulterated content. Feel free to drop the show after the first 2 arcs though.",8,Recommended,"Jul 26, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c8838d25ce,18,6081
"Plz note that this a review based on a manga and anime as well (no major manga spoilers). first let me say this anime has one of the best op's and theme songs u will ever get to hear (invasion), also some pretty good fights. And how could I not mention the infamous Soul Society arc. This is a must watch, it's undoubtedly one of the best arcs in shounen anime. The animation is pretty good too. And i personally think Bleach's artwork is the best in all of shounen. It's just that none of the other arcs could match the soul society arc, the arrancar saga was too dragged out and riddled with fillers here and there, but Ichigo Vs Ulquiora being the obvious best fight of this anime. And what came afterwards didn't meet anyone's expectations. Yes I'm talking bout Aizen getting taken out with a single attack and Gin's pointless sacrifice (seriously why would u wait god knows how many years plotting to kill someone only to try when they are immortal). And the Fullbringer arc was boring AF despite the animation being good. And then the anime got cancelled coz of bad relations with Kubo and his editors. He never gave his full effort into drawing in the last few years, the background was blank, the characters didn't look lively and that final fight was even more disappointing than the Aizen fight. One way to prove this the rapid decline of sales in Bleach's last years (ending up in 13 place). I feel it wasted a lot of potential and could've been a lot better howeve still i hold it very special in my heart and recommend you guys to watch the Soul Society arc and the Arrancar saga too, after that just drop the series. Read the manga if u've nothing better to do, the TYBW also is riddled with plotholes.

There's nothing that can make people captivated in terms of plot. The fillers worsen the story timeline as well. However, everything that is linked to the story somehow seasoned the story and the story becomes interesting with all the flashbacks and the curiosity the story gives you. Art : The art is good. Sound : The soundtracks are good enough to make you captivated. Character : The only character development I can see is in the Shinigami. The main character doesn't develop much. Enjoyment : I personally enjoyed this anime a lot. All the battles, sad moments, flashbacks and the story combined and make it a good anime that is worth to give it a try.

The flaw they say are the filler episodes and I agree but personally I found some sagas of filler episodes very beautiful for example the saga of the alternative history of the Zanpackutō and the Saga of the invading army of the Thirteen Brigades. I found the characters very interesting starting from the protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki who seems cold and detached and who likes to get into fights, but in reality he is good and is always ready to help his friends if they are in difficulty. There are also other very interesting characters such as Renji Abarai, Zaraki Kempachi, Kira Izuru and others, each with their strengths and weaknesses. And they all have their own personal evolution which I really liked. I liked the story in general, some moments more than others, I found it boring at the beginning but then as I progressed I liked it a lot, above all the fights are well done and some had me very excited, I also found some of the protagonist's transformations fantastic.

"--WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS-- I think Bleach is good because everything is nearly perfect expect Orihime says ""Kurosaki-kun"" a lot of times in an episode. Overall 8 points. ***** Story: In fact Bleach has a good story. And this story continues. But sometimes it gets stuck and Ichigo gets a power-up. That's annoying. And story isn't completed in the anime, that gets on nerve a bit. (if it will be completed, I edit.) Anyway, I love the story and I find myself. 9/10 Sound: I think Bleach's openings are flawless and in-anime musics composed pretty good. 10/10 Art: Bleach's concept seperated to two to me: opening and in-anime. In openings, Bleach's concept is modern, fresh. I love it! In anime, Bleach's concept is a bit traditional because of shinigami outfits etc. But I love this, too. 10/10 Enjoyment: To me, I enjoyed on early episodes to Fake Karakura arc. I haven't liked Fake Karakura arc because pre-episode (brief summary of previous episode) parts are very boring. But I like battle scenes. <3 8/10 Character: Bleach's characters strong but if you compare with Ichigo Kurosaki, they're nothing. The story has made Ichigo an overpower. He is shinigami at one and quincy, Vasto Lorde, Fullbringer. And he learned bankai in a week(I am not sure :p) and if you look at Rukia, Orihime ; they are like zero to Ichigo. 8/10",8,Recommended,"May 10, 2019",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0ebc541359,19,1335
"Rewatched and realized these things. First of all, it has a good story except for FILLERS. Yeah FILLERS almost 50% of this anime is about another story. Some of them are boring and some of them are pretty good but FILLER is FILLER after all xD Good battles except for fights in FILLERS. I don't know why but these fights are really irritating me especially that weak af HEROINE(You know who am I talking about :)) Sounds are just amazing. Nothing to say about that op/ed. And about the characters hmm.... yeah I like them except for ICHIGO(In simple word MOST ANNOYING CHARACTER in this anime. He has nothing but FEAR. Can't do anything but BLABBERING.) Anyway, nothing to say about other characters. And where is NELLIEL TU???? (the Cutest character in this anime IMO. It looks like they completely forgot about her :((( Frankly, I regretted to rewatch this anime. But yeah we all like it.

"I realize not everyone will like this anime, and I can generally understand why. It can be incredibly weak at times and it's got so much filler, it's difficult to know what is canon and what isn't. At any rate, it's one of my favorites. I will be skipping any filler exposition in this part. As I've seen people say many times before, the first major plotline is the best (1-63). I completely agree there because it has well done character development, a pretty good story, and very little unexplained successes (by that, I mean very few asspulls). What it does extremely well here, and throughout, is foreshadowing. As an example, Ichigo somehow gets a hollow mask when he's fighting Byakuya. Seems unexplained right? Just wait a little longer and everything starts to come together. At this point, character development shifts from the main characters (Ichigo, Chad, Orihime, and Uryu) to the captains, vice captains, and some seated officers of the Soul Society. It also explains the hollowfication that Ichigo displayed when fighting Byakuya. The story at this part is rough, I'll admit, but the change of scenery to Hueco Mundo, the focus on blurring the line between hollow and soul reaper, and explanations of strange/powerful abilities was interesting. Not to mention, Aizen was a pretty badass villian, Ichigo was just more badass. The weakest part to me is what happens next when Ichigo looses his powers. Again. Then goes through the process of fighting and training to get them back. Again. This time he gets the new (but Chad it all along) Fullbring power. What I love about this part is that the villain of this arc wasn't who I was expecting at all, so that twist was refreshing. This arc also shows Ichigo knows how to assess his situation and change his tactics accordingly, since his Fullbring power wasn't nearly as strong as his Soul Reaper power initially. Always nice when there is more character development. That last arc is by far the weakest in my opinion because of the repeat of events in a different setting and the ending doesn't help it at all. Fillers are a huge downfall of this anime. After the first arc, you get a filler arc at least every 20 episodes and then it wastes one more entire episode making sure you're up to speed with what happened because it was so long ago. While the first filler arc (Bount Arc) tied in nicely with the world built as a whole, none of the others did. Not to mention the other fillers took place in the middle of a major arc so where the characters were located made no sense most of the time. For example, Ichigo is busy in Hueco Mundo and a filler arc happens that places him in Karakura Town like nothing happened. That's all I have on this.",8,Recommended,"Jun 27, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a8133953b7,19,2712
"From the start, you might find this anime boring because it takes a while (around 15 eps or so) to get interesting but my goodness, when it does from start to finish you'll never get bored of it or turn away from it. The characters are many and therefore, there isnt much development for them, like with Ichigo, it seems he only has honour, protectiveness for his friends, a slightly arrogant nature who isnt all that bothered by the fact there's a hollow living inside of him and to me personally, i havent seen any other side to him; it was very disappointing to see Tite Kubo ignore other feelings of his because if they had focused on them a little bit more, it would have added more of a depth to Ichigo's character. (Suggestion: like maybe he could have had a crush on Rukia or something and believe it or not, but most fans of this anime think the author will put Ichigo and Rukia together at the end, which is just another reason to watch it because whilst there have been hints throughout, there hasnt been anything substantial going on between them lol I'm afraid though that its just a fan's opinion and not even a spoiler so we just have to wait and see about the relationship side of things :P) However, the language used, art and the awesome battles between him and his opponents more than make up for Ichigo's 2 dimensional personality!! Sometimes its funny, sometimes its moving, its nearly always filled with tension so you are gripped with wanting to find out what happens next, its awesome!! The plots are very good too and Ichigo's forms and strength just keep getting better and better, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good action shounen anime to watch! :P",8,Recommended,"Aug 26, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0357d24680,19,1685

"Oh Bleach...have we certainly had our times together...through good...through bad...oh, the memories... Bleach will always be the anime that pushed me over the edge to take anime more seriously, like it satisfied a yearning. If you think this is going to be an expression of fanboyism then you will be gravely mistaken...I'm sure others in the shonen block of works would fare the same. But Bleach will always be my first and I'll always have a love for it because of that. I jumped into the fray and binged the 180 episodes in existence at the time. The thing that fascinated me most is no matter how overpowered Ichigo seemed to get it was never quite enough for the next arc. But that was one of the great things about being able to binge and the annoyances of waiting week to week is with an extraordinarily large cast of characters it was interesting to look back and see how much everyone grew over time. Perhaps this I can just copy and paste to all the shonen category...and frankly I don't even want to get more specific...it is what it is. I will never declare Bleach is better or worse than a Naruto or One Piece because really...it's just different flavors of the same food. We get to journey with a plethora of characters, discover weaknesses in their strength or character or state of being and see if they overcome. Sometimes it takes too long...sometimes it's like it happens and you wonder, what the hell?!? The thing that has and will always capture me (*NON SPOILER*) that a certain payoff takes nearly 200 episodes to occur...and it was a powerhouse. That's the thing that will always captivate me with Bleach...you do seem to get just enough time to really understand some very distinct personalities (credit to Tite Kubo for that) and have some solid moments of clarity that make you fall in love with the righteous and the malicious, whether it's Ichigo's determination to protect, or Byakuya's Pride, or Grimmjow's desire to be the best...each person has their fight and it's a lot of fun to see how and if they grow and at what length they'll go to achieve. Pros: One of the things that drew me in was a particular fight that took 3 episodes...that combined with the art style of the opening was like a moment of 'where have you been all my life?!?' And yes, if that's not your cup of tea no pop shonen anime is for you. Cons: The obvious. You gotta fill 366 episodes, right? Some arcs took way longer to resolve than necessary. I won't even disparage the 'useless' arcs...even with obvious fillers you get to learn a bit more about the world. It ends suddenly. The zanpakuto arc had 2 arcs...the last arc buttons it up in the last 5 minutes. C'mon, you spend hundreds of episodes giving me overdrawn characters and fights but it's okay to cut the last arc and be all like 'hey, here's the end credits, we're done now, bye bye!'

"I thought the progression and pace of the show was good, and it got more interesting as it went on as well, dimension travel and all that jazz, the vizard stuff was my favorite part of it. As the show goes on these ""side"" characters that you think are worthless and not really even needed slowly become an integral part of the story as well, It happens pretty slowly and gives you the sense that all the characters are growing and are essential to the story. I loved the first 220ish episodes of this series but dropped it around then. It suffers from the typical things that most long anime series do, it has crappy fillers and there is always a new final final version of a move which is faster then the last move which was the fastest move they have every seen, and a new stronger enemy who is stronger then the last guy who said he was the strongest, you get the point.",7,Recommended,"Oct 22, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_e76044a74a,19,873
"This anime is the one that made me start watching anime seriously but now that rewatched it wholly,it feels quite dull somehow.Let me tell you the reasons: Story(6/10) The story is pretty simple,Ichigo who can see spirits meets Rukia and because he warant to protect his friends and family from Hollows,Rukia gives him (supposedly) part of her powers.Because that wasn't allowed she gets sentenced to execution and Ichigo and his friends set to save her and of course,to do that he has to fight all kinds of enemies who become his comrades later on.From here,it gets quite repetitive and he has to save someone every time and it's got lots of fillers who are boring af.It should have ended with him fighting the big bad boss Aizen but they throw us some other fillers and continue a bit after with the time skip,so yeah...I liked the last arc 'cause they approached it a little differently though Art(7/10) At first the art looks old school,blurry,the details aren't so well defined and the resolution is bad but later on it gets too look gorgeous.The girls and the guys are hot if you ask me,there isn't too much fan service but you have what to look at whether you're a girl or boy.I loved the Espada's look and Ichigo's outfits(and looks of course) Sound(8/10) I liked the music and I really loved most of the openings but some of the endings seemed out of place while others fit perfectly.I liked the OST that they played when Ichigo fought too,it's exciting,I guess.Their voices were alright too and fit the characters personality.We even have Sasuke's voice actor for Ishida. Character(7/10) The MC is cool and has some interesting powers but throught the whole anime he doesn't change and still remains kind and his only goal is to ''protect''.I wanted some kind of revelation,a tick,that would change his persepective more.His companions are mostly there to cheer him on because he has to be the hero.And the villains are way too overpowered sometimes.Especially Aizen,that conceited sheit.I liked the characters but didn't feel that much of a connection with them.Between all the fights and all the things going on I get...passive. Enjoyment(7/10) Sometimes I enjoyed it and sometimes I did not.It's hard to stay focused when there are so many fights going on without talking to much or breaks in general. Overall(7/10) If you like cool sword fighting scenes you are at the right place but if you want some real deep stuff this is so-so.It gave me a ''meh'' feeling in the end.It's not special,and it's hard to stay hooked on such a long series I liked it mostly because of the nostalgia,to be honest.",7,Recommended,"Jun 20, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_fb2d7ff5ef,19,2610
"Bleach: A spoiler free review, and an honorary thank you. Bleach was my first anime. It was a show I watched that looking back, defined my youth in the early 2000's. It got me into monster of the weeks and ghosts and drawing everything like it's about to throw down. At the time, I thought it was the greatest thing ever written, only to grow a decade older and see it's unfortunate flaws. This review is hard due to me trying not to spoil it, even though anyone reading this probably has seen the show, or knows enough of it to understand what I'm going to convey anyway, but I'm writing this review on behalf of a show that gave me something to look forward to in a time of dreamless nights, and for a possible reader that either missed the hype a decade ago, or was too young to know it even existed. I will never suggest someone to watch this show. It is too long. It is too much of a commitment for so little. And yes I will praise the design, music and a handful of episodes, but in no way would I say someone should watch this. This was a show of its time. One I am very nostalgic for. You couldn't really do something like this today. This is a show about the relentless fight for friendship, without any of the lessons of letting go. This is a show about growing up, without any of the normalcy of adulthood. This is a character driven show, following people who worry less about what the world has to say, and more what it has to offer only to never take it up on its offerings, resulting in never changing, never growing. I want to say this show made me realize the value of fighting for what's right. But it didn't. I learned nothing about myself or other people or even death in this show. But I did learn this. I learned that not all art is perfect. Not all stories are flawless. But anything that makes a thirteen year old kid get out of a bad mood once a week, forgetting about school, bullies and raging hormones is good enough to exist. It's good enough to stand by. It's good enough to say thank you. For being there when nothing else was.",7,Recommended,"Aug 28, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_14bd628e5a,19,2058
"So I found some time to do my first review over one of my favorite long run anime. That anime is know as bleach. Bleach is an anime about a teen who is delinquent minded at the same time sweet minded, who saw ghosts ever since he was born. This attracted many evil spirits a other spirits towards him as the show progressed. He meets this soul reaper named rukia that hands down shinigami powers to him. Now everyone that sees my review should know what I mean by shinigami. He is soon met by his friends who aid him in battle as they learn about hollow origin and other key points to what threatens the world and They protect innocent souls from these evil spirits called hollows. I rated 6 for the plot of the story as fair, and the term fair, meaning I didn't necessarily dislike or like what it gave to the plate. I still have understood and misunderstood concepts within it. The story in other terms is still something that interests me even though I loved it better as a kid, it's done in anime alot, giving that term fair for being kinda dull on one edge and sharp on the other. 10 goes to art style and concept of art. Im not looking down on 2000 anime when I say this, but for bleach to be out during 2004 it's art style was good for a 2000 anime, meaning yes, it still is a masterpiece for the way it has altered to the modern world. As it progresses to 2012, it's the most appreciated art I have seen, and this can also be followed in the hueco mundo arc. 10 goes to sound cause why not. No matter the environment the protagonists find themselves in, it is well adapted to the tone of sound and music, which makes it all the more acceptable for any fight really. I mean when I say that let's put aside the uninteresting filler that bleach offers. The soul society arc is introduced with rock music, the hueco mundo arc was introduced with a mexican chime, and we find the karakura town arc to have a save the world sound effect that opens up to what the characters are trying to accomplish during their parts. Character gets a 7. I mean the character development has an acceptable rate to get a rating term, good because they at least manages with most of the cast. There are alot of characters they also don't really mess with all that much like halibel, wanting to save her lieutenants from death, and the only connection I saw was the connection in the flashback, which wasn't enough. I mean, it's not like anyone ever pays that much attention to the bad guys, but it's a what evs. The characters motivations are not the most uninteresting thing you'll ever see especially with ichigo wanting to protect loved ones, but realizing what he is up against may show what strength he has to obtain, and what strength he has to lose, which was a good part pf character in the karakura arc. My enjoyment is a 9. Now don't get me wrong when I say the fighting is great , thinking that I find that the most appealing in anime because I don't. What I found most enjoyable in this anime was resolve, sound, and art style. Resolve is in the character section so it's rounded to a 9. I mean I'd pay to see the true last season of bleach, because of how stupid I found the pv 7 for saying ""final season"" is like saying that we put a filler arc as the last season, probably why most people shit on it and say it went way down hill or it could just be me. Yes, it did go downhill but there have been other arcs that made bleach out stand in many ways. Overall, 8. Bleach has gave very good understanding of what appeals in anime the best and at the same time tripping over a few things, it was worth my time tbh and No matter what anyone says I think that everyone should try it out, no matter how they think of it. Well that's all folks and be reminded to never get mad at opinions, but also upraise your opinion with both logical and not logical ways in order to make your point stand out.

"For me, after the first episode hooked me I didn't really start enjoying the series until about episode 15 when the story arc really begins to pick up. I'm a fan of the two lead characters Rukia and Ichigo which made the interval bearable but once it took off - WOW - I couldn't stop watching! Note that after I began watching I started also to read the manga so my review is biased in the fact that I read the manga as well. Artwork across the series is a mixed bag; filler arcs I found some good some really boring; sound, especially the OP and ED were all outstanding except for one in ~50 (which is really amazing!); characters - to me this is one place where Bleach really does a great job in having a huge cast of characters that you grow to love (even some of the ""bad guys"") and all of them are different and unique. Character growth is limited and mainly only the growth of their powers. Depth of the story is not too deep, someone will usually mouth off or say something that breaks the tension at the more emotional moments. Overall, I really enjoyed this series as I enjoy a light, action packed, sometimes humorous, story with great music, good to excellent art, and engaging characters that I can root for. I hope that once the manga is finished that the studio will also animate the final arc.",8,Recommended,"Apr 30, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_a98d09a24d,19,1308
"Bleach is a popular anime that means it is known by many not that everyone loves it or any thing. No there are many people saying it should end well I do not believe is should. Well the story begins with the protagonist Ichigo with ability to see ghost then he gains powers due to an encounter with a shimigami that’s when the story begin about his adventure of trying to protect everyone he holds dear. Now I am a fan now I did look in to why some people dislike this anime well I will try to work those reasons in this NOT review. Now lets begin first thing I notice is people saying that there is no story line or no straight track with that said. Here is my response the story line in Bleach is Ichigo's resolve to protect things around him while others(enemy) trying to disrupt the peace. Another thing the story line goes to new arcs/filler arc to show you the soul society's past or present that you would have not known before. Next problem was they said the main character has ridicules power ups. Now my response is with more power the power takes on new form just like someone trying to gain muscles body would change or someone trying to gain power would gain weapons(form of power). No character development was the next problem people faced with the show. Now I do not believe this to be true we learn many things about the characters past, friends, and how/why they fight. Next we have the problem of same thing happens their example was first it was Rukia being saves then it was Orihime being saved. What was my first response because yes people similarities were there but each one was taken for their own reason Rukia be taken and sentence to death was because she gave her powers to a human. The reason Orihime was taken because Aizen though her power would be useful to him that and he did not want that power on the soul reapers side. Next problem people faced were that there were the pacing of fights with no strategy and fight all happen the same way their example being good guy wins or good guy gets help and wins. Of course the good guy side won there was so much at stake that they would obviously have people help them win. For example of that would be during the arrancar arc where first Chad then Nell then an injured Ichigo were all defeated before Zaraki, Kenpachi came to defeat the arracar. For the no strategy there were strategy mainly who would fight who, or where the people would be position at. They would have their meetings all the time in the show where they would talk about strategies if you were not so arrogant to pay attention you would have notice that. There were few who cares about that the other questions were painfully obvious if you were to pay the slightest attention you would understand why now an example of these stupid reasons they dislike the show was bad dialogue with the example(""your sword will never cut me""). Now besides I only saw this arrogant or crazy people say this in the show one was Aizen(arrogant), and during the fight I sated above between Zaraki and the espada where both of their bodies were difficult to cut so yea the boasted that the other could never cut themselves. So yea their dialogue being about their day to-day Life was unlikely to come up in a sword fight.",10,Recommended,"Sep 7, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_45e806cff4,19,3252

It manages to make some scenes so epic that I just can´t wait for the continuation of the anime that has been dead for a while now, but is said to show itself again sometime soon. What was also very outstanding of course is how powerful the characters are in bleach, the strongest of them: The main character, Ichigo Kurosaki, one of my favorite protagonists of all time.

"Bleach was the anime that every person knew about or watched way back in the 2000’s and understood most of the references to. If you haven’t heard of bleach, do you even watch anime at all? (Some spoilers ahead) Ok. But seriously, Bleach has a really strong beginning and the animation and art was nothing short of ahead of its time when I look back and think about it. The first few episodes were touching and I remember tearing up a little at the chad and parakeet episode. I love the concept of the soul society and the Gotei 13 (or as the dub called it, the 13 court guard squads lol) Also, you had to admit, no anime has ever came close to bleach when it comes to the aesthetics, it’s very prominent and unforgettable. (The title cards are appealing as hell) It had such great potential when I started watching and I never tore my eyes off of any episode for even a second, always wondering what would happen next and how will the plot progress and wondering how the characters will grow into their own? The answer is that they don’t. Not at all. Not even the main character Ichigo, even though it seems that Tite Kubo tried his hardest to put all of his brain cells to work to make Ichigo a good/interesting MC. It just never happened, unfortunately. But I give the series the benefit of the doubt, Kubo probably didn’t plan too much about character relationships or understand much about the complexity of it to really write anything to begin with. The series ended up adopting the go to shounen formula (1. main character gets powers, 2. fights enemies, 3. meets main antagonist of the arc, 4. trains some more, 5. gets a power up, 6. Beats the bad guy, and it starts over from step 2) But, bleach gets all of the same criticism that I just listed above. And it gets rather annoying that people tend to use this to point at the series and say that it’s overrated. For all of its faults and horrible female characterization, bleach does have its heart set in the right place, I feel. I really felt that there was a time that bleach was heading into the direction of human morality and maybe something deeper, for example, what was in the chimera ant arc of hunter x hunter. But then, nothing happened. Bleach was really ass-pulling power levels and flashy powers where characters have time to monologue and chat like they were discussing the weather over some coffee. And it really pulls the series down and make the culmination of everything that has happened in previous arcs vanish. There was nothing memorable in the cast either, I can’t remember most of the Gotei 13 except for the attractive characters or the ones that get the most screen-time. Ultimately, I have no qualms with people who speaks highly about bleach, because I do think that some of the characters have great potential, and I really do like the main cast sometimes, mainly Rukia and Ichigo. And it’s such a damn shame, because I honestly wished Kubo would’ve grabbed at the chances that were dangling right in front of him, and I’m far from an expert writing critic, but even I could see the exact parts where the series just completely wasted everything. But I did enjoy the series while it lasted, even if it was mainly due to my attachment towards a few of the characters.

They give you full arcs, instead of a few couple hundred episodes with no sense (you know what I'm refering to). Lastly, I kinda like the love triangle between Ichigo, Rukia and Orihime.

"One thing I have learned from Bleach is that just because something is popular does not make it good (the recent US Presidential election taught us that). It is far better to judge something on your own than be swayed by the masses. STORY: 3/10 Bleach follows every single cliche you can think of, and then some more that you perhaps didn't think of. It's forgiving when you think that the show has gone on for a whopping 366 episodes, however it's less so when you're actually watching it. Much of the good moments come from the villain's own story rather than the hero's. Though the kido spells are a nice touch (hence my username), there isn't much that makes it stand out - typical wham/bam affair. The only thing unique about this area is the layering of filler arcs and episodes, which are actually more entertaining than the canon ones. ART: 6/10 Bleach follows a standard drawing template and color in affair. The funny moments get downgraded to frowns and chibi expressions for effect, but the normal ones are a pretty average affair. The characters seem typical of your early 00s anime: glimmering eyes, funky hairstyles and uniforms that seem quite difficult to move in, let alone fight in. The backgrounds are pretty much the same too, with the haunting exception of Hueco Mundo at night. Again, standard stuff. SOUND: 4/10 There is a possibility, albeit a small one, that if I watched the subbed version instead of the dubbed, I'd like this show better. Like the show itself, much of the good voicework comes from the supporting characters rather than the main ones. Johnny Young Bosch's cool drawl does little to dim Ichigo's arrogance and Michelle Ruff is almost always monotone for Rukia except the occasional scene. Special mention to Kate Higgins (Unohana, Nanao and Lillynette), Karen Strassman (Momo and Soi Fon) and Megan Hollingshead (Rangiku and Nemu) who portray quite a range of vocals here with the limited script. Special mention also goes to the soundtrack 'On The Precipice of Defeat' for being awesome at the right moments when the good guys turn the tide of battle. CHARACTER: 1/10 If a show has to rely on a large variety of characters to pull it through, then it is not a good show. Bleach has an entire airport full of characters that they can focus on, but none are given the attention they deserve. The filler episodes really bring out what could have been done had the supporting characters had more screentime, but the main arcs remind you of the central team ad nauseum. I can forgive overly arrogant characters like Kenpachi, Toshiro, Byakuya, Yamamoto and even most of the hollows in favor of more fleshed out ones like Momo, Kisuke, Yoruichi and Aizen; however one thing I cannot overlook is the main character Ichigo. The boy seems to be in love with his brooding antihero archetype and sadly much of the development of his character has gone into his powers (which are constantly pulled out of nowhere) rather than his personality. There is nothing relatable about these characters, they are as flat as the pages of the manga they came from. ENJOYMENT: 4/10 It is hard to watch Bleach - there I said it. I often found myself skipping episodes and enjoying the filler stuff more than the main story. On paper, this sounds like a good show, but watching it is a different story altogether. I will watch certain episodes as guilty pleasures, but to go through the show again is... let's just leave it at that. OVERALL: 3/10 Though it does have moments where it shines, Bleach does not make for good watching if you need something deep to draw you in. Watch it for the big fight scenes, watch it for the fact that heroes get to be heroes - heck, even watch it for the fanservice sometimes, but don't watch it if you want good anime.",3,Not Recommended,"Apr 13, 2017",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d8be409163,19,3772
"BLEACCHH!!! ahh... where to start?... STORY: to me has held itself up alright for a good while now, every now and then i watch an episode and find (little) interest towards anything that's going on unless it involved a decent fight scene or finally seeing aizen or gin or whatever their names are. i feel that... it's something of interest, but not too much. i'm not going to say it's worth watching 30 eps of filler to finally see the scene you wish to witness, all i do is watch the good moments of the story, (skip like 20 episodes and get to the good part), i suggest it to you too so you and i don't kill ourselves over absoloute boredom of the characters doing things and talking about rubbish that doesn't entertain anyone. ART:as soon as i witnessed bleach it was easily compaired to already witnessed anime and had beat them all. aka dbz, naruto n such. 'there is definatly higher quality anime then bleach, but i never focus on bleaches quality of art in a negative way, i like the character modeling they look like real people more so than most anime characters. nowadays it's quite avarage quality for an anime in detail. but it's good. SOUND:ahhh!!! so good! lol it's like the main reason why i enjoy it! the fight scenes of the earliest episodes of the show had such epic battle music, it still does! well i feel like they milked the music to early and yeah later on the new music doesn't sound so epic because the beggining music was quite powerful. still i have some of the music on my itunes for writing inspiration, good stuff, get's you into the mood. CHARACTER:well... characters... they could be alot better, not much interest of mine goes into the characters they are rather boring, although some characters like- grimjaw and uluqiora, they were the most memorable characters and they like die, i was thinking grimjaw would be in it for longer, -I wanted him in it for longer-. bad fan service, he was such a character, oh and same for uluqiora, but maybe i would have ended up hating them eventually, they died being loved i guess, some characters aren't interesting and original, some you want to hold onto a little longer. ENJOYMENT:I... enjoy bleach sometimes, i don't usually watch it, but if i know there is a important part happening, i will be told by my friend and i will watch it, aka cool fight scene aizen appears blah blah. it all seems a little repetetive at times. it was boring as hell at many points milking the same story except having the characters memory erased and stuff... bounto... stupid stuff... ádd more interesting things bleach creators!, i know fans will stick by it, (the show) that is, well i beleive you are loosing their interest slowly there are many that will stick with the show to the end, but for god sake give us more enjoyment, even though your show is alright... every now and then.

"Bleach, being one of the three popular anime's from Shonen Jump, has a reason for being so popular. The main plot of the anime is rather good and it is thought out which is why I give it a higher score, however the characters, side stories, longevity, the ending of the main arc and predictability are what bring the anime down. I am not saying the characters are ""lame"" or lax, I am simply saying that instead of throwing in random side arcs to prolong the series, perhaps they should work on the character development and a solid conclusion. This would bring the anime a much higher score from me, and I am sure from other fans. There are memorable characters however, this is no doubt. This is the one thing Bleach does have. The characters may not be well developed, but they are definitely memorable in the sense that everyone can relate in some way to one or more character's personalities (as limited as they are) or situations. I would recommend that you skip the side arcs. The Bounts, Zanpaktu side arc, and Shusuke Amagai side arc. The only worth while side arc you should watch would be the back in time pieces about how the Seretei was organized before the current group of captains. Very interesting. If your into sword fighting, battles, action sequences, some adventure, and a mix between reality and fantasy, then Bleach is for you.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 14, 2011",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4360a77cca,19,1349
"this anime revolves around the main charichter icigo kurisake who lives with his father and two younger sisters, obviously ichigo is no average highschool student , he has the ability to see spirits however these spirirts are not all simply reminants of human consiousness as many have deteriorated into a state of existance know as a hollow , these are dark creatures that are the spiritual embodiment of the darkness of souls that have lost there hearts this anime is perticulaly long with plenty of fillers which many would find extreamly irritating. also this anime features the common good guy always finds a way to win nonsense which includes: gaining new powers and abileties after every tough fight shouting makes your attacks more powerfull in conclusion this anime is pretty run of the mill with a fairly intersting storyline that does however become dull after a whyle i would not recomend this anime for anything otherthan killing time",6,Mixed Feelings,"Dec 29, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_2a8156f3de,19,947
"Bleach the anime, put simply, is to the manga what batman forever is to batman. it tries to get the tone but misses due to some unknown reason. bleach is essentially the action version of loony toons. by which i mean its more about talking and creating atmosphere and tension witthin powerful, bursts of combat. sadly what really makes it sad how it turned out is that not only did kubo work on the anime as well, but that it seems that to begin with, the fillers (ie the bount arc and the zanpakuto arc) are on par in every way to the manga to the point that they overshadow the main story. but then they become cookie cuts of other arcs, and it hurts that the good ones have little to no baring to the plot. However for all it's flaws, i have three words to say BLEACH OST IS BADASS. it is beautiful, in fact i can argue, as a musician, that the tracks ""never meant to belong"" and ""morning remembrance"" are on par with pachelbel's canon and the protagonist theme ""number one"" is badass. and the best part is that they sample EVERY style of music out there, from the jpop openings, to gospel ""number one"", to the operas ""invasion"" and ""stand up"" to the surreal ""nothing can be explained"" to number one's metal revamp ""chokaku""lood the animation cut, no corners and allows for some great fights especially after the tedious dialogues which get taxing fast, then you get some fast paced nonstop bloodshed. characters is my favorite part of any show, i'm a villain actor so i love villains and Bleach has thebest villain i've seen since ever. and whilst many say that the constant onslaught of characters is a negeative, i find it a plus as it give a scence of the protagonists progression as he makes more and more allies, and they all become developed without shunting away the older cast. some even throw you through loops. overall i'd have to say it's an enjoyable anime, but if you are going to watch it either steer clear of the manga or read it after, especially as the endings are at different points. which once again is overshadowed in the manga. final verdict: stream first for a taste, buy if you like. and, for the love of god GET THE SOUNDTRACK, it is worth every penny. no every part is under priced. it is a must view for anyone with good taste musically.dramatically, and artistically.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 23, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7d35a1a7bb,20,2300
"For starters, I believe that I should say that I haven't seen Bleach since it's final episode. I watched the entire series up to the final episode, it just has been a while. But the memories I do have of it are fond. And accounting for the entire show it was a great shounen. I don't really believe in giving anything a score because a complex opinion cannot be placed on a value between 1 and 10. But MAL is forcing me to rate it's aspects and it doesn't seem to want to share any of them except for the overall score. So since I am pretty much forced to...here goes. Story 3/10: The worst part of Bleach was its storytelling and flat characters. Bleach's story seems to encompass all that is bad and flawed in the shounen genre. After watching 366 episodes, I cannot tell you a single thing about Ichigo. Other than he loves his friends, which is an observation the anime had to point out to me in the final arc. And that is just the main character. There are loads of characters in this anime, like every other shounen, but almost all of them don't get any screen time. All of them do have their moment, at least once in the show, even if it is only for two or three episodes. So I guess that's good. But we don't go to the shounen genre for it's story telling. We go for it's action! Action 8.7/10 I wanted to give this a nine (9) but I just felt that it didn't deserve it. The action is fast paced and the fights are long and drawn out. Which I like. The fights rarely rely on Deus Ex Machina writing and mostly consisting of Ichigo fighting some enemy while relying on his various transformations (think Dragonball Z). But what's action if it doesn't look cool? Art 7/10: The art is not bad, but it is not good either. The characters are human like and the backgrounds are fine. I don't remember anything out of the ordinary when it comes to the art. The fight scenes look great but the art seems only styled towards fight scenes. So the characters look a little awkward when their standing around and talking. But that is fine since there is not much standing around and talking in this anime. Sound 8/10: The sound is very good. It has it's own urban beat it likes to appropriately play when Ichigo does something cool. But other than the cinematography of the music in relation to the fight scenes it is just a bunch of catchy jpop songs. And nothing to special or unique. Character 4/10: We don't talk about Bleach's characters.... Enjoyment 9/10: I was pleasantly thrilled while watching this anime. It kept me glued to my seat with its fast paced (if somewhat brutal at times) battles. Yes the characters and story are garbage but the fighting and the setting which is the stage for it's fighting is very well done. A lot of people will say that Bleach is the weakest of all of the big three (Naruto, Bleach, and One Piece.) And since I haven't seen One Piece at the time of my writing this, I can't say that Bleach is better than OP. But, after seeing Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, all I can say is...at least Bleach doesn't pretend to have a good story. In my opinion...(perfect flame shield). Overall, I give this anime a 6/10. And the only reason this is so high is because the fight scenes carry it and entire two (2) points.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 17, 2013",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_9b5c0cea5b,20,3241
"Bleach is definitely one of the more ""mainstream"" of Anime, but it's easily overlooked by the more hardcore of the fanatics, It's overall... Decent; despite the fact that it probably took me 3 years to finish it at a very very very slow pace. After the first 8 seasons its just okay. I had every episode downloaded so it was quick and easy to sort through full seasons, and with that as an option I found myself skipping full seasons that were nothing but filler; and the first several episodes had the worst art (in my opinion) and many other seasons were just slow or yet again riddled with filler episodes. I definitely think its worth a look if you can stand the artwork of the character for the first quite awhile, but it definitely picks up and looks a lot prettier in the end; and the action scenes are always amusing if you can handle all the obvious comments that lots of anime tend to suffer. (ie, pointing out incredibly obvious things to the point where it physically hurts your being.)

"Bleach is a long running series as you probably already know or will find out soon enough, it also go's down as my gateway anime but not my first, I simply got into anime because of this one. Now before I get started I'm going to get two animes that may come up with this anime, If you have already seen naruto or one piece you may or may not like this anime, it's really iffy, but as for me when I watched this show I kinda never looked at the other two the same way, this show tended to be a bit more mature which was a good thing and then I never watched the other two again (sorry Luffy) but anyway onto the review. Impression the initial story is not actually bad and it has a very good approach to the super natural world the story transpires in however the only thing that I would say was a real hindrance to the show was the filler episodes, actually they didn't only have episodes they had entire story arcs to get in the way of the story but you can look up online which episodes to watch and then you can have a more pure and less frustrating experience because the writing in the initial story isn't half bad however it isn't the greatest either it's simply entertaining which is what it is supposed to be. Characters there are a lot of characters in this show, some you like some you hate and some you can really relate to, but I'm just gonna talk about the main ones. We start out with Ichigo Kurosaki who is your average teenager that can see ghosts and the whole story just goes from there, but ichigo has some of the typical shonen main character traits of having spiky hair, love for his family and friends and his cliche desire to protect everyone, but Ichigo seems to play it off well and actually differently, Ichigo is sort of what I call an already perfect character though perfect isn't the word but he seems to already have developed into the character that we wanted to see some snot nose brat from the beginning of another shonen anime, this is actually his biggest problem he doesn't develop at all, the only thing that really changes is his perspective on the world and his animation quality, but I can admit that it was refreshing not to hear some spiky haired kid yell ""BELIEVE IT!"" or something and despite his flaw of already having matured, I still liked him but he may seem boring to some. next you have Rukia Kuchiki a shinigami from the soul society, there's not much I can say here but she tends to be useful in introducing the world and is the first character you see in bleach but she does help move the plot along for the first 60 or so episodes, over time rukia and ichigo grow closer as they work together but like all anime, it just never happens. then there's orihime who is a regular human until later on that is kind of a ditz and brings in some comedic value but also has a crush on ichigo for which he is completely unaware of and she never really confides to him. Second to last is chad who doesn't really say much and is a giant (compared to the japanese) but like most big people I know he is a rather gentle giant with a good set of morals but unlike most characters with those he has actual reasons to be the way he is and he makes for one of the best written characters of the show. finally there is Uryu who is you typical glasses character, with a grudge and rivalry with ichigo, despite having a similar personality. there are many more characters for which you will see in this anime which will help push the story along some being my personal favorites. Sub vs. Dub It's that time, that time for me to openly accept the dub and be picky as hell with the sub, but this time I can say despite some other opinions I would have to say that the sub and dub seam to be evenly matched however are pretty much the same but I did find both of them entertaining in their own way's. Final verdict about a 7 for this one this is an anime that tends to hold it's self up and can actually be taken a little more seriously than others but it's not the greatest but I could blame the filler for that.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 26, 2014",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_c0c11fd958,20,4044
"First of All, almost everything you have heard about this is probably true. For Bleach is a masterpiece gone mediocre in most ways possible and depending on during which period of anime era and your lifetime you have watched this show will color you in such arrays as to be an analogy to the contrast between feminazis and Trump supporters. My advice - Be calm, be composed and be a centrist like JBP and his cohorts. Here's the best case scenario for you - You haven't watched too many anime or have just got into it or maybe you're low expectancy sorta fella. You are in luck if you are reading this review in 2018 and still match the above criteria, you should start watching the show (and also, WT@f!!). But if you are anything but this, here's how I would recommend going about this: 1) NEVER touch the manga. Kubo may be a Vasto Lorde of Shounen enterprising but he himself and his associates fucked the last third of the manga into a corner that left everyone who was on the reading end with a bad taste in their mouth. Trust me on this, or maybe reddit and google it if you have already come this far in search of the truth, that nothing good ever came on following through with the manga after the anime or even just reading it in general. Almost everything it does, is done better with sounds, animation, musics and VA in the anime (that's what animes are all about; I hope you knew that or maybe I've just spoiled that for you). But alas, if you are the sort that will not accept something to be called preposterously horse-dung unless they have lathered their own tongues with it (Omaewa gross nanoka, ne ?!), be my guest and go ahead with this endeavor knowing and calming your about-to-be-shitfaced heart with this solemn truth that I never read a single page of the manga. EVER. And the world's better off without having to deal with the aftermath of such a traumatic incident. 2) Check out anime filler info websites about the anime, which does boast a spectacular target of 45% BS material that have nothing whatsoever to do with the canon (The producers of the show must have been creaming themselves for the sheer opportunity they got to try their hands at creative writing; Newsflash asswipes, every single one of majored in with flying colors at shit-handling). However if you are the sort with a lot of time, OCD or a general lack of aim in life (maybe a little interested in masochistic self-indulgences), take note of the episodes with Kon and Karakuraizer stuff and when Gotei 13 join, well it's riot... of shit-fests. Kanpai! 3) Always, and I insist ALWAYS, keep the wikipedia pages on list of seasons and episodes bookmarked and close by when you start with the show. The sheer of repetitive content and unnecessary content in this show is absolutely mind-boggling. Most of us are all about spoilers and really into making a deal about knowing things beforehand for it takes the fun out of it things - this is one place where even the creator himself wished he were into astrology. At least he would have some chance of knowing about the pile of shit-storms he had brewed that had taken a life of their own. Also, to be fair, Burichi anime is where the fun begins after you spoil things so that you can still make some efficient choices about the hours and hours of your precious time that 'must' be given to this quasi-faeces obfuscation of logic. Once you have those list nearby and have knowledge of the summary of the episodes you are to watch, you'll able to skim to and finally watch the good stuff (more often than not, you'll have the liberty to skip full episodes). This show really is a bit like swimming in a muddy pond to get to a handful of lotuses that have been sprinkled sparsely to give some meaning to your choices in watching it. And don't fret about missing that one or two cool stuff that should happen in an otherwise 23 minute garbage gunk; you'll mostly end up seeing those scenes in a heartwarming 5 minute recap at the beginning of the next episode or helpful reminiscence of wherever anybody refers to that incident for even half a second, in half-finished sentences. 3) Continuing from the last point, Bleach has similarities with Naruto. Obviously they part of the Big 3 of shounen and bigshots in anime in general. They have both very liberal policies when it comes to recaps to of past scenarios (You will know the Lord above truly loves you in those moments when you'll see that can fast forward and/or skip those scenes altogether) and they are both really into crappy dialogues that made melodramatic and meaningful but are reality, obsolete, redundant crap that are said too loudly taking in consideration its audience who are retarded in mental nature (I mean, what choice and position do we have to oppose that assumption having watched this show). And the power-ups and creative choices of the people involved in dealing with boss fights and their formulations. I have a theory: Either Tite Kubo was replaced by a ghostwriter write after he had permission for SJW for publishing it or he is the typecast sort who really has limitations doing things for story beyond creating sweet character designs, interconnections and amazing BGM suggestions (These are the things nobody can ever take away from show; and this is also a summary of why it's failed work of genius). Thankfully, Naruto had so much more in terms engaging and exciting in terms of story, lore, shounen, characters and progression until its last 50 chapters came about. But that's another story and we'll respectfully let it all slide for it gave the world ITACHI UCHIHA!!! 4) Nothing will ever get you accustomed to every shithead in the show having to each other's ful names again and again and again. I mean, have some faith on the readers remembering the names, or using a wiki or not caring at all when characters keep popping out of the woodwork left and right - most of them have mediocre stories and motivations that are obvious and non-engaging which is still fine because one cannot help but appreciate how this many different characters who mostly are damn cool in design keep coming from the same mind who brought about atrocious obstacles to peace - namely, Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue (Petty names, Petty Stories, Petty existence, Good powers wasted with weak reason on why they even have it all). 5) Ichigo is the lucky lottery winner. Remember that and it will make everything else easier. He will always and has always been everything and will eventually get everything that is necessary for him to overcome his troubles, in his words, ""because he has to"". At least, he is far from an annoying shounen MC who is always more talk and speeches except for the part his character design (and also that of every other character in this manga and of any other manga of this sort at the time it was being written) is to keep repeating people's names instead of genuine words and getting all up in everybody's business. But it is his story and he very much lively irrespective of which time period you're watching. And there's Isshin's Shinigami OP backstory - I can't get into it. If you're a hardened explorer, you will do what you want. 6) Any sane person would have Rukia the main character of this story and Gotei 13 more exposure in the story. Not only in his VA amazing but out of all cringy and over-the-top funny bits in the show, the ones with most chances of making you laugh will almost always include Rukia - her voice. words and chibi design totally are made for it. And Gotei 13 in its entirety and its interwoven links with each other make for such an interesting pursuit in the story make things real interesting. The funny part is Gotei 13 is part of the main cast and appear in parts or whole in major sub-plot and basic plot progression in general. Despite that, the show manages to shove its head up its butt. That's just fate is all and you on the threshold must decide whether you choose to be involved in the shit-spattering that is collateral to being successful in the achievement of being able to pull someone that big-headed out of their arse. It's a riot if nothing else, pros and cons churning over the buckets. 7) Lastly, this point will sum things up by reiterating something previously notified - this show is very callous in how it uses its power ups, its successes and failures. To give you some perspective almost every power used in the show, whether it be a KIDO, SHIKAI or obviously BANKAI, everything causes humongous explosions that dwarf their battlefield and fighters. There is nothing wrong about doing so as it provides a spectacle, a hype opportunity and an excellent chance at animation but what it does end up doing is it devalues all the hard work of that power up when nobody really gets caught in it, because there is one-upper to make a sensational battle manga moment and if by chance they do get caught in it, they are healed, helped and recovered surely. Shounen in general have an aversion to killing characters, partially because continuity is important to serialization, partly because young audiences and sometimes the author isn't just willing to part with his design that he favors (the last one is what ODA said about the One Piece and its death issues; that is one weak point of the world's best shounen manga and it makes up for it by doing better in other places). But life can only shown to be meaningful and worthy of fighting for when you impress upon people how quick and cruel death's embrace really is. For a show that has a radical like Kaname Tosen who willing accept rigid dichotomies of good and bad, it sure is an eyesore to see only the bad guys dying out in defeat and the good guys always living till sunset and rising anew in the next sunrise. A few important character come through death in flashbacks but it's no Bellemere being shot by Arlong or Minato and Kushina's sacrifice for their son and Konoha. It doesn;t leave you aching or even too bothered and that's Kubo's limitation as a writer. All in all, you are patient one if you read through all that and me praising your temperament is your probable reward out of this. If I left an image that I am pissed at the show or its work, it is only in that I have seen anything as imperfect and incomplete. It is not anger but pity which I truly feel for it all. And I still will take my hat off to Kubo if I ever meet him for sheer work he put in to create the world. The harsh truth is Bleach will always be third in every person's shounen olympics and not even even qualify for the pre-heats in the overall list for most anime watchers. That's is just how it's story goes. P.S - If somehow I got you convinced out of watching this show and you are certainly unwilling to utilize it to better your life in some productive way other than going into the world of Manga and Anime and nearby stuff, you are advised to read One Piece obviously. Also, consider Ishida Sui's Tokyo Ghoul series and the most underrated manga I have ever read, which is Vinland Saga.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 1, 2018",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_8078810011,20,11032
"Strap yourselves in for an honest review of Bleach! One of the nostalgic anime classified among “The Big Three of Shonen”. Many of us (me included) might have watched Bleach at some point when we were young and it may have influenced us and our anime tastes just as much as it influenced the industry of Shonen anime to come. But from a more critical eye, does it have some worth beyond just nostalgia? Story: 4.88 / 10 Unfortunately, Bleach fell into two big traps. First, it didn’t know when to end. Second, it couldn’t deliver on its climax. Both of these problems come from the manga, so it isn’t strictly the adaptation’s fault. As for the first point, after the first big arc (which was pretty great), it becomes clear that filler arcs would just be plugged in to make up time and nothing would happen of consequence to the main story set up in the first arc for hundreds of episodes. Now, I didn’t personally mind most of the filler arcs, I think some of them had great ideas and I enjoyed the stories. However, the placement of these filler arcs was terrible. A 15-episode filler arc would begin in the middle of a climactic battle or event and that is unacceptable. Not knowing to end after the first great arc and plugging the rest with horribly timed filler was an annoyance. The second point was Bleach’s nail in the coffin for me. The big climactic arc that was built up to ever since the end of the first arc was horribly handled. None of the villains that were built up to be massive threats were threatening at all and instead of stepping up the stakes and using interesting team-ups and techniques to overcome the threats, they just ruin their powerscaling entirely and retread the same tropes as before. The way they ruined this important arc literally made me want to drop the series the first time I watched it in entirety. Art: 5.42 / 10 Being from the early 2000’s, the animation isn’t amazing to begin with, but gets the action done well enough. Fortunately, thanks to the length of the series, the animation became better as it went on and by the end it looked pretty good. Altogether, I’d say it looks above average; never terrible enough to want to claw my eyes out and never great enough for me to rewatch a scene purely for the visual spectacle. Sound: 7.22 / 10 The soundtrack is a little repetitive, but the tracks that they use are memorable and fit the tone, with some great theme music for the protagonist and good usage of the more ominous tracks when introducing villains. The openings are of a generally high quality, given how many there are, and even the ending songs were pretty good overall. The voices are also pretty good, for both the subbed and dubbed versions, with some characters standing out more than others. The soundtracks and songs might be the aspect of Bleach that I have the most nostalgia for because of how memorable it is. Character: 7.73 / 10 Bleach has a wide variety of characters. The upside to running for more than 300 episodes is that there is a lot of time to spend with interesting characters to learn more about each one of them. The powers are also very interesting and unique. Watching so many characters with complete backstories and interesting abilities interact – be it in combat or not – was fun. Bleach is also the origin of many of the coolest anime character names I know of. Enjoyment: 6.14 / 10 Nostalgia aside, I’m not crazy about Bleach. Every badly placed filler arc prompted me to stop watching for a few weeks and after the big climactic arc, I was so insulted that I stopped watching for 4 months before I picked it up again and finished the last 50 episodes. Don’t get me wrong, there were enjoyable aspects – like I mentioned – but overall, I can’t say that Bleach was very enjoyable. I appreciate the fact that I watched it, but not much more than that. Overall: 6.28 / 10 Truthfully, if the climax arc was done well, Bleach could have been above a 7 out of 10. With the climax as it is and with the badly placed filler, I can’t help but feel generous in giving Bleach this score. I can understand that some people love Bleach, be it for nostalgic reasons or because they just liked the cool fights regardless of the stakes or scaling, but unfortunately, this is as far as I am willing to go for Bleach.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_7ab88d775d,20,4292
" I was recommended Bleach by a Friend. He said it was awesome and underrated. After much pursuing, i finally agreed to watch it. The more i watched it the more i didn't want to. But I can't break the heart of my friend. Story- 5 Bleach's starting is good. With having a typical Shonen Jump story, it's first few arcs were done good. After the Soul City or whatever it's name was it becomes a drag. Too much filler. The following arcs seem unnecessary and boring. It's Like Tite Kubo( The author of Bleach) is being forced to write anything that comes into his mind. Art- 3 The Animation by Pierrot is the worst. Naruto's animation was not any good either. The first 100 episodes of one piece have better animation then this. The animation is not in flow as i expected. The manga art is better. Sound- 4 While the songs are not bad, they are not good either. The score is annoying. What's with the Background music??!! Starting at scenes when it's not needed. Character- 4 The MC Ichigo does not have any experience in sword fighting, but defeats people stronger than him. He has an obvious plot armor. The villain Aizan is decent, but i didn't understand his motives. All the other characters are forgettable. Enjoyment- 3 No enjoyment. Think of a thing you enjoy to do. Now think the opposite. That is Bleach for me. I gave it three, because i only liked till the soul society arc. Overall- 4 Overall Bleach is an anime you can live without watching. My advise- Don't watch it.",4,Not Recommended,"Jul 29, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_4bdb79faad,20,1478
"** Summary: This is a show that's very popular and for good reason: It starts off with an interesting plot and characters. The problem is that everything in the story is a cycle. The main character doesn't make any significant choices, the character development is abysmal, the power system is inconsistent, and it's basically just a formulaic plot-line in which the character magically gains powers, predominantly through unknown means, to overcome antagonists who are completely stronger than him. And then, those foes decide that instead of dying or seeking revenge, they join him in his quest to...... no one really knows. The main character doesn't have consistent goals after the first part of the story unravels, and that leaves this as a 90% plot-driven story with 10% character-driven story with stagnant characters. The anime is based off of the Bleach manga, which is a better use of your time than the anime. This anime review does not include comparisons between the manga and anime. Story: 4/10 (excluding the endless fillers) The story is quite captivating and unique at first. As the protagonist explores a new type of world, we see some interesting world-building. After that, the plot falls apart. There are a ton of fillers (more than any other anime, as of 2022) that add nothing to the main plot, and even the canon plot is formulaic. In fact, some of the fillers are more captivating than the canon episodes because, either way, there’s no clear aim of the plot through the eyes of the protagonist. Ichigo doesn't make important decisions, he just talks about being stronger and then some unexplained ability is made available to him and he obliterates an antagonist that decimated him at the beginning of the arc. Characters don't work together, they also formulaically split up for one-on-one fights. None of the main characters die, it's unrealistic, and the plot twist towards the end is ridiculous. Because it is so plot-driven, we don't really get to know what is important to Ichigo, and we don't care after the first few arcs. Ultimately, the story started great with a unique world and premise, but it fell apart once it started using a formula to ""force"" Ichigo to win fights and focused on the plot over the characters. Art: 7/10 The art style is interesting and works well for the setting. Some episodes have lacking quality, and the fight scenes are sometimes just a few frames repeating to show Ichigo magically overpowering his enemy. As with most anime, the art quality was inconsistent, but it worked nicely for the show's concept. Sound: 8/10 Shiro Sigisu did an excellent job with the music. The voice acting is poor, and some voices are just whiny for no reason. The music is one of the best aspects of this show, so I weighed that quite heavily for this sound section. Character: 1/10 This is a show in which most characters are useless, annoying, don't contribute to the plot in a meaningful way, don't make any important decisions, and allow the plot to fling them around like a juggling ball. As aforementioned, this is a plot-driven story, and the characters don't develop. The worst part is that we know nothing about the main character or his thoughts/feelings. He is thrown into a unique situation, but they don't talk about that. Instead, he just does whatever he wants, is almost killed but can't die due to some magical ability that isn't explained until the end (and very poorly at that). Ichigo's friends are mainly annoying, they don’t develop in a meaningful way, their powers make them useless most of the time, and there's a weird rivalry that’s vaguely explained but inconsistently portrayed between the main character and his “friend.” Even the characters that you are initially intrigued by and care about are so flat and pointless that they don't matter. Basically, the main character is just going to win no matter what, you don't know why, and that's how it goes until the end. Enjoyment: 2/10 This show was interesting and captivating at first, but it completely fell apart once it focused 90% on the plot, started its formulaic battle/decision/power system, and spent 10% of the time poorly trying to develop the characters that started off somewhat intriguing. Overall: 4/10 This is a show that's very popular and for good reason: It starts off with an interesting plot and characters. The problem is that everything in the story is a cycle. The main character doesn't make any significant choices, the character development is abysmal, the power system is inconsistent, and it's basically just a formulaic plot line in which the character magically gains powers, predominantly through unknown means, to overcome antagonists who are completely stronger than him. And then, those foes decide that instead of dying or seeking revenge, they join him in his quest to...... no one really knows. There are plenty of anime in which this happens, but the watcher knows enough about the characters' interests, development, skills, abilities, training, and abilities to keep them understanding what is going on. The main character doesn't have consistent goals after the first part of the story unravels, and that leaves this as a 90% plot-driven story with 10% character-driven story with stagnant characters. This could have been an excellent show with memorable characters, story, visuals, and music; instead, it fell apart and never recovered.",4,Not Recommended,"May 7, 2022",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_d4a15cdb88,20,5405
"Bleach is a good anime. However, being a major shonen anime, it has a lot of spoiler arcs to fill time until the manga gets a bit ahead. The main arcs are all quite good, but the filler, for the most part, are sub-par. ------ The characters in Bleach are extremely one dimensional. There's little to no true character development for anyone, and most pretty cookie cutter. Overall, Bleach is a decent anime. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece and you'll like it.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 23, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_48f1cecad6,20,468
"A friend had asked me to check out Bleach and so I did, knowing that is was the first long running anime he got into and knowing that I had already watch far more anime than him - hence more exposure to the anime world that him. I decided to watch in but tread carefully and be a little more open than I otherwise would have toward a long running anime. In the beginning it got good and I was interested, but not too interested. All was going well 'til I hit a filler arc that was so long and dragged out that I got bored and wanted to stop, but I didn't, hoping that once i was over it, and it resumed with the canon story, it would get better. After the painful-to-watch-without-cringing-arc about Bounts, it got interesting again and then i got back into it and started to watch more often. This cycle continued for the next filler arc. Right now I'm at a point where I'm about to watch a really long filler arc and I know it will kill my interest in the series but I don't want to skip anything because I like to see things through. Bottom line is, the series is good. BUT! All those filler ruin everything and kills whatever moment is built as the actual canon story-line progresses. With Bleach my interest is like an on-and-off relationship. Sometimes I really like it, sometimes it tests my patience and I don't. The story altogether so far is OK. I have yet to be amazed by some plot twist which I am hoping there will at least be. Watch this only if you have nothing else better to watch or if you are a kid (who doesn't know better about anime), OR if you are into typical shounen battle anime. The way I'm writing this is makes it seem like it sucks royally, but it really doesn't. It's entertaining, but I still feel like it's not good enough for me. Hope you enjoy it more than I do. It's 350+ episodes. Good luck on your journey with Ichigo Kurosaki if you decide to go through with it. The next time I come back here is because I have finished watching the entire series.",7,Recommended,"Nov 17, 2015",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_55d7a71499,20,1987
"Skip all the fillers and it's okay, despite all the nonsense happening in the show. The soundtracks are amazing too. Some problems with Bleach is the fact that characters only appear once and they will no longer appear in the future. The concept of Hell was never explored until the movie and there isa lot of plot holes. The mechanics of the Bleach universe is very inconsistent. I recommend watching this anime for some brainless fun. The fight scenes are amazing but that's about the only thing you'll get from Bleach. If you want to see a better shounen Hunter x Hunter is what I recommend.",7,Recommended,"Mar 3, 2016",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_25c280c9fb,20,594
"I'm going to try write this somewhat brief review, for a very vast series. If it's too long, read my tl;dr at the bottom of the review. Nope. Nevermind, can't make it brief. Too much to say. Coming from someone like me who is extremely inattentive when it comes to longer series of anime, this one far surpassed my usual ""60-episode limit"" that I impose upon myself normally. Nonetheless, I finished it. I was nothing short of impressed that I managed to stick through the whole series. The first thing I would like to address is the good parts of the anime (, just what I liked about it personally.) - - Epic, lengthy storyline: For those who love a grand and epic story, Bleach will most likely not disappoint you. It's long, and interesting, and fun! - - Good artwork, and a great soundtrack!: I absolutely loved the soundtrack for the anime, more than I even liked the anime itself. That being said, the artwork and animation in the anime is definitely of good quality! - - Diverse cast of characters!: What I marveled at the most about this series was the immense amount of characters you encounter and/or follow on their prospective journeys. It was truly massive! Now, the bad. Keep in mind however, this is what I personally dislike about it, the things I name may be considered a plus in some viewers' eyes. So this is pretty much just a list of things you can determine to be good or bad. - - Long: I'll be blunt here, the series is LONG. 366 episodes?! Seriously?! Way too much for me, my enjoyment of the series deteriorated due in part to the immense number of episodes. Really not my thing, might be yours though, give it a shot. - - Some lackluster character development: I wasn't very impressed with the development of individual characters in the series, it seemed like the series was swamped with the quandary betwixt quantity and quality. But they chose a larger quantity of characters instead of a higher quality of character development. I didn't get to know and love characters like I have in some of the shorter series I have watched in the past. But that's sort of what happens when you have your story jumping from character to character in the midst, or between episodes. I liked the characters, sure. I just didn't love the characters. Kind of important for me normally. - - Filler episodes: Now, before I get blasted by someone's secret technique for this, let me just say that I absolutely cannot stand filler episodes. I hate them. Some of you like em, sure, they're fun and can be interesting. But throwing up a good 6+ episode arc right when the final showdown between the main character and a powerful adversary was about to unfold? SERIOUSLY?! That's just insulting. I was not pleased with discovering so many strange arcs appearing in the series exactly where I didn't want them to be. If anything, the series should've maybe been 200 episodes long, if you cut out all the filler and all the stuff that felt unnecessary. That's just my two cents though. If you like fillers, you'll probably adore watching through this whole series. - - Techniques became dry: Some of you may not get what this means. But you know how in a fight between two characters, how they fight, and one thinks he has the upper hand, but then he discovers he’s injured and the opponent launches into this lame dialogue about the secret technique they used that the person didn’t expect? Yeah. That garbage is RAMPANT in Bleach. I got so goddamn sick of it by the time I finished the series, I wanted to cry. In small series with few episodes, this isn’t a problem. I’ve seen the tables turn so much. Bleach could’ve been a Pokémon adaptation that involved magikarps using splash attack until one finally evolved into Gyrados and used hyperbeam. The excess of plot twists would have M. Night Shyamalan spinning in circles. This is no big concern for me normally, most anime I’ve watched have plenty of what I just mentioned. However, 366 epidoes full of this stuff is far beyond what I’ve ever wanted to experience as far as plot twists are concerned. tl;dr : So, the good is that it's interesting with a fun story and cool (and numerous) characters. Fun for people who like a long series to immerse themselves in. The bad is that it's friggin' long, has too many filler episodes and arcs, and doesn't leave me with a warm and fuzzy feeling with any of the characters except for maybe a very slim few, none of whom are the main character. Frankly, I’m glad the anime is over. For now.",7,Recommended,"Aug 13, 2012",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0c174bd515,20,4491
"Honestly if it wasnt my first ever anime i watched as a kid back in like 2010 it would be a 4/10 An early 2000s anime full of sexism and no longer funny jokes and tropes, most of the characters dont make ANY damn sense as real people and only serve as dehumanized tools for the main character to get TSUYOKU but he magically stays so vague and average throughout the entire show honestly the whole cast should just check out and go do their own show and it would be far more interesting than watching ichigo struggle his way out of averageness for nearly 400 episodes and FAIL Art was nice, despite everyone hating the early bleach art i love it, and i love the middle bleach art as well, then the late stuff i never watched so yeah THE STYLE is very fashionable. If bleach got anything it got THE STYLE Openings SLAP!!!

"There’s a reason why bleach is one of the most dropped mainstream anime of all time. Literal snooze fest, if you can even stay awake watching the first 33 episodes you deserve a gold medal and I’m being 100% serious. This is an anime of it’s time (2000’s) and it’s literally unwatchable in the current day. bleach can’t even be compared to One Piece or Naruto, in fact it’s laughable that this is considered one of the big three. Both Naruto and One Piece aged really well in comparison, Save yourself some time and skip this mid. The story is extremely boring and cliche, nothing about this show stuck out to me. Even for something that came out in 2004 the troupes and themes have been done way too many times before. The plot is very reminiscent of a really bad Yu Yu Hakusho fanfiction made into an actual series and milked harder than a cow on an unregulated farm. Not to mention half of this dumpster fire is literally filler that has nothing to do with the actual plot. As for the designs...complete and utter azz. Half the characters look easy to draw and if you change the hair color of my boy ichigo he would look like every other forgotten shonen protag from 2006. I literally have nothing else to add to this review because I already forgot most of what I was watching, it was that unmemorable and boring. This series would’ve went hard if we were in 1996 but in 2023 you would play this to make a baby fall asleep.",1,Not Recommended,"Jul 17, 2023",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_0c1594d525,20,1427

"Bleach is defenitely part of the big three, I wanted to get that out of the way first, I can defenitely see it has flaws, but there isn't much of a problem if you just skip the fillers, the characters are very likeable and relatable, I recommend Bleach for those who want a simple story which isn't taken over the top, it is very easy to get into and if you go into it with an open mindset then you would be able to enjoy it as much as I did, it is not very complex at all, there aren't any really complex powers in it like say hunter x hunter, there aren't really plot holes in it either, everything can be explained pretty well, it might be unpopular to say but I take Bleach over Naruto and One Piece for the sole reason that I can relate to the characters very well",7,Recommended,"Jun 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_3c0e622e57,20,769
"Before you read this review you should probably know that Bleach is my favourite anime so if I am a little bias you know why. First lets get the good out of the way: the characters, story, plot, and adaptation. I absolutely love each and every character in this anime! They all feel so real I suppose you could say; I feel like I've actually bonded with the characters in this show. Even if some of the characters don't have the best writing they are still enjoyable because they show so much emotion that you can't helped but feel attached to them in some way. And don't even get me started on how good of a villain Aizen is, he has it all: the aura, the personality, the intelligence, and so much more! I can't say much else because of, ya know, spoilers, but just know if you have a thing for characters you'll like Bleach. The story for Bleach is actually pretty good. Each arc goes relatively smooth while also introducing new side and support characters perfectly while also progressing the anime at a great pace provided you don't watch filler. The world building isn't the best but it works for the show, it may come of as random bs but the show does eventually explain that and also explains why things are the way they are in the anime. The plot, although not that interesting at first, does actually open up lots of story opportunities for the show, that's really all I have to say that is good for the plot. As an adaptation from the manga I can't that there is much that is bad about it at all really. It has great voice acting for both dub and sub, the animation is great, the music is great, pretty much everything about it is great. But now I must unfortunately say the bad things about this anime. Some of the characters, while still being great, do lack character development. Now this isn't saying those characters bad or don't have any character development, just that they couldv'e had more. The story is amazing but it doesn't have very great flow and it has a tendency to introduce characters and plot points that are completely pointless later on. The story is also completely unpredictable at some points which can leave people confused and or shocked in a not so very good way, then again every show needs some level of unpredictability or else they would be to boring. I have no issues with the plot besides the fact that it doesn't set a clear goal for Ichigo to work towards besides just getting stronger to fight the next opponent tossed his way, but that's more of a preference thing since the anime that I was used to when I first watched bleach had the main character have clear goals that they were constantly working towards. In my opinion Bleach has a brilliant but flawed adaptation, don't get me wrong the adaptation amazing but there were a couple things I didn't like about it. First is the somewhat inconsistent animation where its pretty amazing during fight scenes but during other types of scenes it looks pretty wonky which can kinda ruin Bleach's vibe, secondly is of course the appalling amount of filler. Now I know you can just skip the filler but for people who are new to anime and or don't know what filler is can easily get lost in it. But overall I rate it a 9/10, oh and by the way the anime is absolutely hilarious sometimes so that's another great reason to watch it.",9,Recommended,"Oct 1, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_5ba4f72fb4,20,3324
"Early episodes (1-11/12 sort of) are not easy to digest, for a more mature audience, in the sense of the writing and directing. Drawings are nice, animation as well, art style is a bit 'everywhere' but becomes more clear as the show progresses. A lot of unique and interesting, alluring and mesmerizing music tracks. Audio design is decent. Dialogues consist too many explanations about characters' drives and ambitions. Timeline of events, even within a single episode, can cause some discomfort as you try to make sense as to why a specific scene is placed where it is on the timeline. It appears the show is aimed at teenagers (mostly), but the topics the show chooses to tackle seems to suggest otherwise, that the show is geared towards a more mature set of viewers. If watched attentively, a certain degree of chaos in the writing and directing is quite present. Cannot tell if it's deliberate or not. All in all, the show is kind of fun to watch due to it's plot devices, fantasy ideas, the worlds it built and the show self-awareness as so not to take itself too seriously. However, there's some discomfort while watching the show because of its childish approach to script writing and the conveying of more profound ideas (if at all such were intended - or existed in the first place - to be presented).

"Bleach is one of the Shonen Jump ""Big 3"", along with One Piece and Naruto. The concept of Bleach is very interesting, but has been pulled off with mixed feelings, mainly because of Studio Pierrot, the animation studio behind Bleach's anime adaptation. The story starts off slow but introduces you about the world of Bleach and different types of characters such as Soul Reapers, Quincies and Hollows. And the Soul Society arc really makes the story engaging and brings forth some iconic lines that you've probably heard in social media. The anime has A LOT of filler, around 45-50%!? And some of the filler arcs aren't even that good! (*cough cough* Bount arc), as expected from Pierrot, So you'll have to either put up with that while watching, or you can just read the manga, But you'll be missing out on some very good parts of the anime. The animation overall can be a pretty mixed bag. Again, as expected from Studio Pierrot (Before Bleach TYBW). At worst it has some mediocre, even bad looking animation with low frame rates, But it also has some highlights that are exceptionally good looking even to this day. But the soundtrack is very nice, It has lots of music that matches the atmosphere of the situation at play and some songs that really stood out to me that i especially liked was ""Going Home"", ""Number One"" and ""On the precipice of defeat"". I have been bashing Studio Pierrot a lot with this anime adaptation, But keep in mind they made the Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War arcs have really blown my expectations, But this review is about the original. The anime has many shortcomings but overall because of how good the plot and soundtrack is, I say it's a smooth 7/10, You'll have to try it atleast once, Don't judge a book by it's cover.

"Bleach review SPOLIER ALERTS Just finished Bleach today and this is my review. I will mostly compare Bleach to Naruto because it’s the only Big Three that I’ve watched other than Bleach and I don’t find it fair to compare a big anime like Bleach to a new gen anime like Demon Slayer. I’ll get straight to it the ANIME of Bleach is a 8.5/10-9/10 at best. Like I specified I rated the ANIME and don’t start talking about the last arc that will come in 2021 because I didn’t read the manga yet. So please, haters go f*ck yourselves 🤝 Animation : At first the animation of Bleach was lacking. It was good for its time but still when you watch the first episode and you’re used to some great animation well, it disappoint you. But I mean all Big three have lacking animation at first and you can see the growth of the animation as the show evolve. I really liked seeing the animation evolution because in Bleach this evolution is rapidly evolving to a smooth and hyped animation. I’m not saying it was AOT level 💀 but in major fights like Ichigo vs Byakuya or even later in the story when the captains fight Aizen and the Arrancars we could see an upgrade in the quality of the fights and that made them more enjoyable. Design : Surprisingly, even if the animation was lacking at first, I personally really liked the design of a few characters like the design of Ichigo and Zaraki were really good. I don’t know why I like them so much but the “old gen” design really hit me on these two characters. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t say EVERY design are good. I admit that they were tragedy and some men were lost in battle. Just look at my man Renji😭😭😭😭😭 (fortunately they arrange him after the time skip of the last arc, but even there he didn’t get the design that he deserved, R.I.P Renji😭😭). But that aside I personally think that the design were a really good surprise. Like even the swords were really well done. Like when Ichigo and Madarame fought in the Soul Society arc, the design of Madarame’s weapon was good and different. You know it’s small details like that, that makes the anime greater than normal one. Character development : For Bleach, honestly I’m disappointed because the only one who has a real and decent development is Ichigo and maybe Inoue who matured a little in the last animated arc, but even there it took her f*cking 300 episodes💀. I really enjoyed his development and the way he thinks. I don’t say that Ichigo is a philosopher like Nagato or something but he’s way of thinking and the subject that he ask himself about are new and interesting. My deception is truly on character like Renji, Rukia, Chad and Ishida. These guys are every time with Ichigo and they pass by some difficulties but damn they don’t develop any thinking or questioning. Yeah in the last arc (in the anime) you see a little bit of development of them, they got a little bit mature but that’s all. Character like Ulquiorra who’s just here for an arc, have more character development than the principle secondary character. The thing is antagonist like Ulquiorra and Grimmjow have more character development than people like Ishida and that makes no sense when you know they’re just going to be here for one arc. Character : The characters created by Kubo are truly a blessing. Kubo really managed to give all of his character a certain charm either by Fan Service (RANGIKU-SAN) or just because they looked badass. Grimmjow, Ulquiorra, Aizen, Ichigo , Zaraki, Kisuke and Shinji are all formidable character. Either by their way of thinking, the mystery that surrounds them or just because they’re fucking badass😂, they keep the show united and make it a 100 times better to watch. Like when Shinji and all the other Visored arrived in the final battle against Aizen I was so hyped to see them fight. The world built (universe) : I think that the universe of Bleach is really a major force of the anime. The universe is so vast and old that we can’t really predict what will happen or what enemy will oppose Ichigo. And that’s really a thing that I liked about Bleach is that it doesn’t have “boundaries”. Like Soul Society is soooo old that we don’t even know the whole story of Soul Society and it’s captains. So with this really “ancient” universe, there’s an infinite of possibilities for new antagonist or just to know more about the history of Soul Society. Sense of conflict : THE FAMOUS SENSE OF CONFLICT😂😂. This shit is sadly true. Imma ask this real quick, who died ?😭😭😭 NOBODY. This shit made me so sad sometimes like a good death here and here doesn’t hurt in anime, it’s beneficial. Just take for example Naruto, if Itachi and Jiraya didn’t died, would Naruto be as good as it is now ? The answer is no. I mean yeah sometimes I felt stressed because some character were on the brime of death but even then I was like, it’s impossible they die, we’re in Bleach😭. I mean if Rukia or Renji or just even someone like Madarame would have died the show would have been 100 times better. Like expect the moments when Ichigo was depressed and when at the end of the Arrancar arc when Ichigo used the Final Getsuga Tensho, the show wasn’t sad at all. And that’s a major negative point that I hope will be fixed in the last arc that will come out, normally in 2021. Fillers : 45%..... Yup, this is the pourcentage of filler in Bleach. I mean not all filler of Bleach are bad but dammmn they are soo long. 40 episode per arc, that shit just doesn’t make any sense. Honestly expect the first filler arc who was really really bad the other filler arc were ayt or good (6-8). It wasn’t even the story that was boring, it’s just that it takes them 20-25 episodes to introduce some character and THEN they begin de real story. The sad thing is that the end of the majority of the filler arcs were good ngl but just the fact that you got to pass through 25 episodes of pure shit to really begin the story is truly sad. But that aside, the real pain is that it breaks so much the flow of the story. I personally wanted to watch Bleach in its entirety for the first time, so when I finished the Soul society arc, I was so hyped to continue the story but then Boom, I got to face a 40 episode filler. I truly think that if I rewatch Bleach in like 2 years and that I skip the filler, I would enjoy a 100 times more the anime. Ost : The OST were.... ABSOLUTE BANGERS. Like each and every one of them were a masterpiece (I may be exaggerating but that’s okay they’re still beautiful). Like at the beginning I really liked the ost but nothing more, they weren’t special or made me want to sing with them or whatsoever. But then when the Arrancar arc arrived, the Ost were revolutionary. They were sooo good that I sang with them each time they were played. Honestly, I think the Ost are something underrated in anime because when I was watching the fillers, the Ost made the fillers much more enjoyable ( Yeah, I was really down bad at the first filler arc💀). Plot : The plot is the greatest strength of Bleach. I can already hear all the Bleach haters saying : “The only plot you got is Aizen.” and they’re not wrong. Well they’re just 75% right because the last arc take a complete different path and forgets about Aizen, which is making me really excited for the manga. But that aside, I personally don’t find it a negative point that Aizen is the main plot. It’s not like Aizen being the only antagonist makes it boring or without plot twist, on the contrary, Aizen bring with him a ton of plot twist and you can’t say that you don’t like him. If you forgot the fillers, the plot is really amazing and smooth, it isn’t boring and keep you entertained until the end. Just after the formidable Soul Society arc, we directly see Ichigo meeting Shinji who briefly explain him what he is and ask him to join their group (My personal favorite character). Simultaneously, we learn that Ichigo’s father is a Shinigami. So we begin the arc with a lot of information and it let us theorize about the origins of both Visored and Isshin origins. Honestly, the only negative point of the plot that comes to mind, is the fact that it’s not very well balanced. By “not well balanced” I mean that I would’ve liked if they explained and talked more about the origins of Soul Society itself and certain characters like Ichigo’s father. I really liked when they did the backstory of the Visored and the backstory of Urahara because it allowed us to understand more about Soul Society and how Soul Society worked and with what rules. I hope they do it more in the manga 🤞. Form/Powerups : The form and Powerups of Ichigo are a really good point of this anime. They’re charged with emotion, hype and they’re f*cking badass. The thing that I really like about Ichigo’s powerups are that every time that he’s training for a new form or technique, he puts his life on the line. Yeah, I know he’s not going to die even if it’s risky or whatsoever but it really adds a lot of intensity to the training and so a lot of emotion when he finally succeed to attain the new form. Even if Ichigo attains a new form he don’t become overcheated. Like when he obtained his Bankai to fight Byakuya, it still was a tight match between the two. I don’t say that every fight is like that but even when Ichigo was fighting Ulquiorra or Aizen he used techniques that had a big after effect or he just couldn’t control it. So that’s why I say he’s not overcheated at the end because he can’t even reuse the same techniques. My favorite powerup is the Final Getsuga Tensho because I personally think that it was the one charged with the most feelings. Like just knowing that he’ll lose his reaitsu had left me shocked and in pain. Fan service : THE FAN SERVICE😂😂😂😂. The best one no cap (I didn’t saw Fire Force yet so calm down). Honestly, first time I saw Rangiku I knew I would like Bleach💀. No but seriously the fan service is magical. Like they were so many episodes where Rangiku just got drunk and she was acting deliberately to show her boobs, just magic. Bro even her Zanpakuto was fine as hell ( Saying it like that, I know it’s weird because it’s just a sword but if you’ve watched the fillers, you understand me💀). But really the episode were the title could have been Fan Service, is the episode 228, also called “The Greatest Filler of All Time”. If you know, you know💀 Only Ichigo’s fights matter : Yes there’s times to times that Ichigo don’t fight in important fight but even there there’s a reason that he can’t fight ( He’s either injured or in a whole other dimension). Like except some arrancars that were killed by Byakuya, Renji, Ishida and the other captains, the fights where Ichigo isn’t participating are pretty rare. Like I mean the fight against Aizen was put in f*cling slow mode so bad just to wait that Ichigo returns from Hueco Mundo. Like I would’ve had enjoyed so much more the fights if they weren’t meaningless. Honestly before Ichigo arrived there was only 2 injured, Ichigo arrived and then Boom everyone was defeated in the blink of the eye, even f*cking Yamaji got beat by Aizen in like 5 minutes. Just so that it can become Ichigo vs Aizen. So that’s why I would have preferred if some people actually died before Ichigo arriving. That would have prove that not just Ichigo’s fights bears meaning. Favourite fights : Zaraki vs Ichigo Ulquiorra vs Ichigo Ichigo vs Grimmjow Aizen vs Ichigo Arrancar n°1 vs Kyoraku Inoue vs Sakura to know who’s the more useless ( Joking💀💀💀don’t attack me) My rating of the arcs : Soul society Arc : 9/10 First Filler Arc : 4/10 Start of the Arrancar Arc~Grimmjow fight : 8.5/10 Second Filler Arc : 6/10 Hueco Mundo Chapter Restart~Start of the fights Aizen vs Gotei 13 : 8.5/10 Third Filler Arc : 6.5/10 Resume Fights Aizen vs Gotei 13~Ichigo arrival to Karakura Town : 9.5/10 Start of the fight Ichigo Aizen~End of the Arrancar Arc : 10/10 Fourth Filler Arc : 4.5/10 Fullbring Arc : 9/10",8,Recommended,"Jan 30, 2021",Bleach,Bleach,269,bleach_37a380d69f,20,11909
"In 2012, Bleach ended its long anime-run without adapting the final arc from the manga. Dubbed as part of the 'Big 3', it almost felt like an end of an era. Some fans were left confused that the anime omitted its final arc although it's understandable that the manga was still ongoing at the time. Almost 8 years later, Bleach's massive 20th Anniversary Event breathed new life into the franchise as we got the final arc anime announcement: Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War. Mind you, this isn't just an announcement for what fans wanted after all these years. It's a celebration for the entire Bleach fandom. Tite Kubo has amassed a loyal fanbase and I confidentally say that he deserves it for his creative vision and sheer determination. Initially, he didn't expect Bleach to bloosom into the franchise as we know today but mangaka Akira Toriyama provided the encouragement for him to succeed. Tite Kubo's creative vision to make characters dressed up in kimono and supernatural monsters associated with spiritual themes is what made this franchise so special. Of course, he was influenced by other works but Bleach still stands out as a very special show on its own. And with the final story arc, this served as the ultimate sendoff for anime viewers who had hoped to see this one day. Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War is based on the final story arc of the manga, pitching Ichigo Kurosaki, the Soul Society, and his allies, friends against a new enemy known as the Wandenreich. They make an immediately impact by disposing a lieutenant and challenges against the very best of Soul Society. Led by the Quincy King Yhwach, their true agenda remains a mystery but it's clear that they are a prominent threat against all of Soul Society and the human world. Even the world of Hueco Mundo isn't safe from their wrath as Ichigo and his allies decides to take a stand against this new threat. Watching the Thousand-Year Blood War Arc immediately shows just how dangerous and capable the Wandenreich is with their special abilities, equipment, and ruthless ambitions. While not much is known about their, some of their members display a malevolent aura that borderlines on a God-like complex. If there's anything Bleach has taught me about its antagonists, it's that they often come across as charismatic characters such as Sosuke Aizen and the Espadas. While we don't know much yet about Wandenreich, it's clear that they a force to be feared. Our oranged hair main protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki is still the same Shinigami we came to know since previous seasons. Joining him in his quest to stop the Wandenreich includes his loyal friends such as Rukia, Renji, Yasutora Sado, Orihime, and of course, the Soul Society. The oddball of this show is Uryu Ishida, because of his status as a Quincy, and this is a source that gets complex this season. Unfortunately, this season doesn't truly dive into Uryu's motivations or what his true purpose is yet. Most interestingly however, we come to know a deeper background story of a few Soul Reaper captains including Genryuusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, Kenpachi Zaraki, and Retsu Unohana. Even Ichigo's parents gets a spotlight this season as we come to know how Isshin and Masaki met in their past. It's important because Bleach has a large cast of characters and we can easily get lost. This season took its time to give these characters more meaning with their stories. But fear not, other favorite characters in the franchise also makes a return including Toshiro and Byakuya. They've received storytelling about their backgrounds in the past before so this season mainly reminds us how strong they've become. Bleach Thousand-Year Blood War is exactly how it sounds, a war with bloodshed and been in the making for a thousand years. Narratively driven, this arc goes to show the importance of how the past can affect the future in the Bleach world. It goes to say that with every story arc, there's usually some sort of main antagonist but also lessons to be learned. Ichigo has learned a lot from his first days as a Shinigami and this season will he will learn again what it means to be one. Watching this series serves as a celebration and ultimately, a way to give fans back what they've wanted all these years. Despite the near decade long absence on television, studio Pierrot knew it had to step up and deliver this arc to its eager fans. Thankfully, the quality of this season received a well-deserved upgrade. Character designs looks like it got a next generation upgrade with their detailed outlines and expressions. Battles scenes have been enhanced to bring the fights alive from the manga. Most importantly are the way this season adapted its character emotions. There are several episodes where we see how characters are pushed to their limits when emotions take over. This season captures the essence of those emotions at their fullest. Similar, the theme songs and battle soundtrack still remains stellar like the old days. You can say whatever you want about the Bleach but the the music has always been top tier class for this franchise. Bleach is a franchise that always stood out with its large colorful cast of characters, themes, and pushes its lore to a level we've fondly remember. This season takes another step forward to showcase the final story arc from the manga. Believe me, Bleach fans have always wanted this for years and this was another one of those cases of 'not if, but when'. The 20th anniversary was the perfect storm to announce this show and since then, we've been graced with one of the most memorable arcs so far in just 13 episodes. Fear not for this is just the first season of the Thousand-Year Blood War arc. There's so much more left to tell and we're only just getting started.",9,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_75d7872628,8,5760
"Even in the best that Bleach has to offer, some still won't be able to appreciate it. It's bad, shallow, no writing..and the nitpicks go on. To those saying nothing is happening at all, are you even watching the show, because a goddamn war is actually taking place, which goes beyond just (oh look..there's a new big baddy now). Where is the worldbuilding or character developement?- some ask....here's the thing its only been three episodes for these things to show up immediately, Bleach doesn't spoonfeed those thing at you right out of the gate. Kubo always liked the ''show, don't tell'' method, so he takes his time with developing characters, forshadowing and worldbuilding. So far most criticisms are: ''Me don't like Bleach, me rate 4.'' Bleach TYBW is by far the most ambitous arc in Bleach. This first cour will contain the first Quincy Invasion of the seretei, which is by far considered by fans of the series as Bleach at its peak. As a reader of the manga I will say that this arc has a lot to offer in terms of character developement/progression, reveals and twists, worldbuilding and fights... a lot of em. The production value of the series is definitily impressive so far, from the visuals, compositing, music, voice acting. Bleach keeps showing that it deserves all the hype and praise it's been getting. Simple as that.",10,Recommended,"Oct 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f7c4a26360,8,1339
"This has been a long time coming. From those who've been with the series from it's start, to newer fans through the years, to finally not only have more Bleach, but to have a continuation and finally an adpation of this long awaited arc that so many fans have craved for, and wanted for so long. How is it fairing up? Let's see... Story and characters: 9 You've seen the comments, you've seen the ratings, you've seen the hype, and the lore, the attention to detail with each and every step. The faithful adaption of it's story and it's context. As I've said, it's as if Bleach had never left us, and wanted to come back to finally showcase it's final arcs in style in animation form. Fans who have long awaited this will be happy about it. The characters are as you'd expect them to be, nothing is out of place in the sense of that they look wrong, sound wrong, feel wrong, it's all done really well, and you'll have a blast with it. Bleach came back and it's here to stay. Art and sound: 9 Honestly, it feels as if Bleach never missed a beat. As if it's come right back from how it was before, but with it of course, a more modern and stylish touch that you would expect from shows these days, but even with that, it doesn't look bad at all. If anything as just stated, it's as if Bleach Looks as it should, if not better, showing already the care and consideration brought into this, they were deadly serious, and not just on the art from. The voice acting is on point, and classic voices you all remember are front and center. Bleach was, and always will be a BIG THREE for a reason. Even now, it's standing above so many other shows, you'll be very pleased to know, it's been continuing right. Watch it when you can, watch all of the Bleach before, or even read it.

"- I haven't read the manga - I actually took the time to think if what I am about to say is what I actually feel or is nostalgia. I even rewatched the episodes again to confirm this This is my very 1st review to an anime since I joined MAL, I really feel like it deserves it. I will try to keep things short and easy to follow: PROS: - Beautiful animation - Fight scenes are just....on another level. Something AMAZING happens and blows your mind, you think nothing can beat that and BOOM something way better comes out - As I have mentioned, I have not read the manga, but I have read oppinions of the people who did and from what I can tell, they are taking their time with the anime, adding scenes etc. which will improve the quality greatly Every episod is just so full of everything, I feel like I can't even blink or I will miss something important. It absorbs you into it. 7 episodes so far and they all together feel like you watched a trailer. CONS: - This is being brought up by many people, that things feel rushed. I have mentioned this in the PROS, lots of things happen each episode. However, for me that is by no means a con. Look, the anime has only 7 episods, patience is the key, I am sure we will get an answer to all our questions, but in time. Maybe you should wait until it's actually finished airing before watching. - Also related on how fast things are moving, my thoughts are that mate, they need to be quick (the quincy). They need to strike fast, as the opponent does not know what to expect. I mean, sure, they have announced their invasion but that does not mean muchh if you don't know what you are about to expect. Peopple falling left and right is something like a blitzkrieg strategy, they don't want to give the shinigami the time to figure out how their powers work and how to counter them. This is seen like something negative by many people, but again, it's just strategy. As we see in episode 7, the quincy can only spend a limited amount of time in Soul Society. Overall, I do recomand it with all my heart. It's been a while since last time I have been so engaged with an anime. It's just beautiful and it should be appreciated for what it is, but again, might be a good ideea to wait until it's finished airing to watch it, as I strongly believe your enjoyment will be significantly higher.",10,Recommended,"Nov 21, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_35ec3af034,8,2332
"Bleach fans REJOICE! Being one of the first anime I fully watched, I can thank bleach for turning anime into a passion for me (or maybe not? hahaha), which lead to me loving Japan, and the next thing you know, I have been living there now for a bit and am much thankful for it. Does that make me biased? Hell yes, and aren't we all in some way? Let me pull out a bit of negatives before I fanboy away; Bleach has never been the best in terms of consistent plot, nor has it been with power scaling, and a lot of people would mention that it doesn't have very deeply developed main characters, which I generally agree with (although they do fit with the anime). BUT out of the big three shounen, I would say it has the best ""VIBE"": it has good music, awesome villains and STYLE; no seriously did you look at the DRIP that the characters have? Kubo should really have designed clothing... I am basically stating that, Bleach is a vibe. It helps that I love supernatural settings (hello Yuu Yuu Hakusho) too; I just can't get enough of that sense of ""mystery"" that just pairs well with the music (or maybe it's the music that makes it that way?) and the story in general and it's... uniqueness; and no, not in terms of the generic shonen story, but in terms of the overall feel it gives compared to other shounens. I guess if you don't like it, you just don't get the vibe??? Jokes aside, let's talk about the current anime. I have read the manga until the end and yes there are scenes that I am kind of disappointed that are cut, but in the first place; those were cut because of complaints (from what I have heard, which is second-hand information); consumers are never happy aren't they? Ok, I agree, although I was hype, I feel like the first episode could have been a bit better, and there are bits here and there that I would have changed in the 2nd too (trying not to spoil so won't be too specific), but overall I know this arc is gonna rock and I am sure Kubo is looking at the big picture too; there are a lot of things that will happen, thus some things might need cutting. Even though I am nitpicking, I still think it was pretty well directed and executed overall and I was still hooked. Although the new animation looks beautiful, I am not a fan of the 3d animation they used in the first episode for the hollows. The fights and cleanness from all the rest though compensates totally for it, and we won't be seeing much of it I presume as this arc doesn't contain a lot of hollows. Besides that, Bleach has never looked any better; which I am so thankful for. The music remixes from old OST have been also a hit; the intro is a banger; I feel like bleach never disappoints when it comes to music, I would even come to say that it's the main reason why I truly enjoy the show. Music is completely subjective, but most people I know or talked to all agree that bleach's music is one of the big reasons why people fall in love with it. Some may not like it, and that's fine, surprisingly not all people in this world like chocolate either (weird right??), I wasn't a fan of the hollified remix; but I still think it fit and I am sure it's just a matter of getting used to it. The characters are alsowhat made people stop bleach and made others into bleach fans at the same time. I agree that the main cast is very.... boring?; to a point where it gets pretty easy to know what most of them will say and how they will act at most times, and I am saying this even though I love them (let's exclude Orihime from here hahaha). Their dialogue is pretty easy to guess. This season they haven't seemed to change that much either, but I am liking the tension that stems from Uryu. The side characters and the villains thought? Broooooooooo. My favorite captains are back with style and am happy that you could see them in the first few episodes. I am also super stoked to see the villains in this arc come on air. I am also looking forward to the fights; this is the war arc after all. For me, anime; like any form of entertainment; it all boils down to enjoyment. Even though I have some knicks and knacks, I have never felt this excited again to watch anime; and bleach, even though has never been the best show for me from a critical point of view, has always been the best at hyping me up and getting me excited to watch the next episode; a feeling I haven't felt ever since I was in my early teens, where I would go to school and just think about Bleach all day and would run back home just so I could binge watch it. I rewatched it, even with fillers, and still felt that way the second time and even when reading the manga. Rare are shows, or games nowadays that give me this feeling, and somehow, even through my nagging, I just can't contain my excitement for the next episode of this season.",9,Recommended,"Oct 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_951fe3b4d7,8,4800
"Bleach is back and it is better than ever. The Thousand Year Blood War is for me the second best arc this story has to offer. I know a lot of people hate on Bleach because it's popular. A lot of people are already complaining even though we only have 4 episodes up until now. People are saying it's too fast paced. It's not, a lot of shounen now and in the past just adapt stories way too slow. If it was paced slower it would become boring, like what happened in the original anime. People are saying it's too slow paced and that it's taking too long for the invasion to start. You need build-up before you introduce your villains, you know. People think the fights are repetitive and boring. The fight with Opie is amazing. And yes, Opie suddenly reveals a new ability and to some that might feel like an asspull. But that's what makes the fights in any shounen intresting. New techniques and enemies. Some of the abilities Opie shows are things Uryuu has used in the past. We are only 4 episodes in and let me tell you, there are some amazing fights to come. People find the characters boring. But they're not. I do feel like certain characters could have been used more, but even those characters aren't boring to me. They all add to the story in their own way. Whether that be being useful in a fight or adding comedy to the story or adding humanity to it. People are saying this is just a cashgrab. The anime was always supposed to come back. Plus, most people think that Bleach got cancelled because of low ratings. What financial gain would you have by reviving a dead series, unless it's not actually dead. This video goes more in-depth about why the anime was cancelled: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npQvWmqIoAE People are saying Bleach is a boring series. But it is part of the Big 3 for a reason.

I read the manga and I know why people hate certain aspects of it. But the staff is really trying their best with this anime and you can clearly see it. If you are searching for a deep story with a convoluted plot then maybe this is not your cup of tea. But not a lot of shounen is that. Not Bleach or Naruto or One Piece or My Hero Academia or Hunter x Hunter or Jujutsu Kaisen or ... . None of those anime are that. They have a message, they have something that can strike a cord with you. But they not that deep. They are just here to entertain and they are doing a great job at that.

"6th episode will be the famous ""6th episode"" after next week and probably will hold the ""best bleach episode ever"" title until the end of time. I really can't understand the viewpoint of the people who give mid scores to this anime and say it's cutting a lot of material from the manga, as a person who watched the old bleach and read the whole manga I am really enjoying this ""fast pace"" on the early episodes. It brings this arcs shock effect to the maximum and plus Tite Kubo is in this adaptation people, it's probably the writer's choice to give bleach a fresh, jump start after loads of fillers and silly fights lasting like 5 episodes. Personally, I am really enjoying it so far. So if we are done with these gibberish arguments I would like to point out the things that are going crazy in the anime right now. I am writing this review and only 5 eps are out right now. 5th episode was crazy and like I said 6th episode will be the famous 6th episode after next week and probably will win the ""best bleach episode ever"" title until the end of time. I don't wanna spoil anything., just holding on to your chairs, maintain your blood pressure throughout the episode, and hopefully finish it before dying from joy would be my advice. Soundtrack-wise, I am speechless. Shiro Sagisu was always great but making this soundtrack this good in his sixties is a crime. The way he gives Quincies their brand-new menacing imperial themes, bringing old soundtrack with a new taste and adding his ""epic theme collection"" new tunes every single episode is just.. like I said, I am speechless. I was waiting for a good OST but this one blew my mind and I hope after the first break this season he releases some of the tracks cause I can't wait 2 years to listen to this masterpiece. The animation- is good. I can't say I lost my mind over it, definatly doesn't have the vibe of the old episodes but a new taste of its own and I think that appropriate to the situation Bleach is in right now, like after what, 8-10 years you are animating the last arc of an anime and it looks different. Tho to be honest even in manga the distinction between the TYBW arc and the rest is very clear, at least it is to me. So animation and color palettes are different from old but I don't think they are bad but fitting to the situation at hand. I am sure some will say old was better drawn and some will say new has fluent action, I will say I love both and am very pleased with the animation quality for this arc. Gotta add something about the voice actors real quick, I have 4 issues in mind, first, -Yamamoto's voice actor passed away and the new VA nailed it so that's a relief. -Ichigo's VA has grown old I think, his voice is more crispy, and especially the Getsuga-Tenshou sounds a bit different but I am okay with that right now. -I don't know what happened to Hitsugaya and Byakuya tho. Both have the same VAs but Hitsugaya sounds very deep and Byakuya is just not the Byakuya, he doesn't have that sound in his voice anymore and speaks very casually. I guess the only thing I dislike about the anime at the moment is how they butchered Byakuya's sound with the same actor. Final notes-- Watching Bleach with this new look and fast pacing really is a lecture on ""how you bring a 10-year-old shonen anime to life"" and i think we will be seeing this formula for other old animes in upcoming years. Loving how Bleach proceeds right now and I am very satisfied with the outcome, cant actually wait for the new episodes, it's that good.",9,Recommended,"Nov 8, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_c0bf67066f,8,3515

"There is still so much more to see if you know what happens during the Thousand Year Blood War arc, so I doubt it could be condensed into only 13 episodes. I will say though, from what else has released this year Bleach is leagues beyond a majority of other new Anime out this year. Great designs, fights, OG voice actors, the animation is superb in so many areas compared to something like Demon Slayer (which is still good in its own way). I would recommend Bleach and Cyberpunk: Edgerunners as the two top contenders for this year alone, but again its just getting started 6 episodes deep, still a ton going on, but you know this is gonna be a long and action-packed arc if you've read the manga. Overall, I'm giving it a 10 because unlike other Shonen that have lost a lot of what made them special back in the day (Think about how Naruto has devolved into Boruto), I really only think the only other Anime that can stand the test of time like that is One Piece. In terms of the sub vs dub I think both are great but there's definitely a lot of rust going on with the dub voice actors comparatively to the OG japanese VAs. Johnny Yong Bosch sounds identical and gives the same energy as he did way back in the day as Ichigo, of course, and Chad's voice actor replacement fits superbly but overall I think the sub may be more ideal if you are new to Bleach. Back then, the dub was one of the best around and still holds up, I just think COVID has complicated a lot of the recording process for the dub artists and in Japan it's more intimate (you're required to show up at the studio to record in most circumstances, whereas western dubs you can usually get away with recording at home). It's more of a circumstance of the time we're living in, but it's amazing to see Tite Kubo's work brought to life once more for one final masterpiece.",10,Recommended,"Nov 23, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f5aba3935f,8,1841
"The final arc of Bleach started and honestly a lot of importance has happened to make it worthy a review of the whole thing. This is about the first 3 Episodes and it seems people want to push the hate over the quality of the show. This review will give you a different perspective with foresight about what to happen. These 3 episodes so far where everything and build up with mostly talks giving us information we didnt knew while information we don't know being kept reserved. The pacing is better than in the manga but even with that it took 3 episodes for the set up for the invasion of the Wandenreich, the main antagonist, to finish. The anime is fixing out a lot of content from the manga, most were needless like the interaction between Arrancar and the main cast mid battle against one of the lastest foes. But that can hardly be called a battle since after each attack there were several minutes worthy on characters sharing information. Additional content promised add much either. Uryu and Ryuuken get a scene where they interact and it would seem Uryu would push his dad for more information... sadly we don't see that happen. Thus many of the additional scenes feel welcome. Another needed scene is that is that the whole cast appear to fight a bunch of hollow instead of just Ichigo. Despite being vastly superior, they all use their strongest abilities like Ichigo using his freaking Bankai against to welcome the fans once again. If someone is complaining fanservice just because its dumb ichigo will use it on weaker enemies then they were never fans on the first place. Regarding the infogreat scenes, the viewers are introduced to 2 POV characters who suppose to be fully-fledged Shinigami, did seem to have gotten a briefing about the area they are going to protect like how Ichigo Kurosaki looks like and Spiritual Awareness. The setting is also lifefull. While it was night while the hollows attacked, the explosions and chaos created during the fights did cause a lot of panic. Same in Soul Society where a murder ocurred off screen and we don't see any of it. Also the anime adapted perfectly Kubo's cinematography visually like how Ichigo recalls what Uryu said about the phone call infogreat in the manga, a missing scene in the anime that got so needed to be expanded to safe animation and pace in the runtime. Kubo is apparently involved but a very good scene like that is gone to the heavens. But if you turn on your brain and consume the pretty visuals and excellent narrative, it is easy to get what is going on. Certainly worthy a movie or old style OVA. The opening is also a great advertisement treating characters that do a lot later as important. But the opening and ending songs are amazing. Some redone ost are also good like Number 1 while others like Hollowfied sound better. If you have already read the arc, you are getting much out of it unless you want to see the big scenes animated for which you have to wait at least for episode 4 where the invasion begins. If you are a intelligent consumer, if you like pretty colors... great animation, visuals, complex characters and great story. you have them here If you want something else, then go look for it.",10,Recommended,"Nov 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_5c0c91dc1e,8,3200

"(Technically this is not a review. This is just the words of a Bleach fan.) When Bleach ended nearly 10 years ago and when its manga ended nearly 6 years ago, I was heartbroken probably like every other Bleach fan out there. I was heartbroken because I thought we'd never get to see Thousand-Year Blood War arc on screen. I DID MY WAITING, 10 YEARS OF IT! Jokes aside, the day I thought would never come finally arrived. I just completed it and I still can not believe I actually watched 13 episodes of TYBW on screen. The day the first episode aired, I was afraid that my expectations (due to the long waiting) could never be satisfied but I have never felt so wrong in my life. TYBW exceeded my high expectations and left me craving for more. Amazing animations from character designs to battle scenes, heavy tension from the beginning till the end, bloodbath, amazing flashbacks for characters like Unohana, Zaraki, Isshin and Masaki, Yamamoto and so on. TYBW gave me everything I could possibly ask for, except more episodes but hell, my waiting for the arrival of the continuation of this will be easier now compared to the past because I know it will be here sooner or later. Even though I don't really enjoy shounens that much anymore, Bleach will always have a special place in my heart and I will keep enjoying it even if I'm 60 years old.

"INTRODUCTION I'm a recent fan of Bleach, so much so that just this week I finished Bleach and with the huge hype that was for this new arc I threw myself in head first and I can tell you that Bleach - A Thousand Year Blood War is an inexplicable work of art. Studio Pierrot has undoubtedly done a magnificent job in terms of animating Bleach even from the original anime as well as this new arc that exceeded limits and gave a gift to all the fans who have waited years for this continuation and I am a recent fan. I can understand the passion that Pierrot put here, The animations are magnificent, the soundtrack is spectacular and above all the combat choreography is ridiculously incredible. The story As I'm not a manga reader at least not in this new arc, I'll try to summarize with what we've been presented so far, Bleach Thousand Year Blood War takes place as a continuation of the events of the original anime saga after the Fullbringer arc. We are then presented with a new threat Yhwach ""The Quincy King"" and his Stein Ritter army that comes in search of the complete destruction of Soul Society, and this is a very brief summary so as not to give you the entire plot that is being developed throughout these episodes. Animation As I already mentioned in the introduction, animation is an aspect that Pierrot has undoubtedly put all its passion into, and that passion is visible, all the scenes are impeccable, 3D is used but it is not something strange and ridiculous, but something that it makes the experience even more captivating if seen on high quality monitors, without giving away spoilers I want to give my personal opinion about episode 6 ""The Fire"" which is a superb visual spectacle and which made me ""applaud"" the work put here. Characters Well, Bleach's characters, quite charismatic and incredible, are characters that you can undoubtedly get attached to and all of them with very different characteristics and with a phenomenal presence, I'm not going to lie, I wish there was more emphasis on certain characters than it's been shown so far it's pretty good having some changed looks which I thought was really cool. The Pace of the Episodes Well, as I mentioned earlier, I'm not a manga reader in this arc and I'm just going to stick with what I'm seeing in the anime. There are some animes that don't know how to make an interesting pace, but in Bleach that doesn't happen, since the beginning it's full of action and things happening and that makes the experience so addictive that we don't even realize the 24 minutes of the episode to pass, the estudio knew how to balance the story scenes with the fight scenes very well and applied the BRUTAL soundtracks that make Bleach Thousand Year Blood War a spectacular arc. Conclusion Bleach Thousand Year Blood War is an excellent continuation of what the original anime was and is a love letter to all the older fans of this anime and the more recent ones who have joined this magnificent work of art created by Tite Kubo. And I highly recommend seeing this sequel, it's a superb job by Pierrot and my grade is without a doubt a very high 10. Thanks for reading this far NitreX",10,Recommended,"Dec 1, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_a840c0259b,8,3154
"Hate or Love Bleach, you cannot deny that Bleach tybw was the perfect adaptation! I waited until the series was completed to rate and give my opinion on the series as a whole. Animation & Art 10/10 - You can tell the love and effort that was put into this arc. Story 10/10 - Bleach has been known for all action and no story, but we got so much revelations, news, lore, flashbacks, and so much more with this arc only. Pacing 10/10 - The problem with OG Bleach was the pacing which is bound to happen with the anime being so close to the source content, but the pacing in tybw was perfect. not too slow but not too fast. Conclusion: I came into tybw not expecting much, but this series blew me! The best return of any anime i've ever seen. I can't wait for the 2nd cour to come this summer.

"Let's get something straight, Bleach as a story and everything about it is not a 10/10. But if we're talking about this season and the medium that is anime and what Pierrot has accomplished, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. The directing, the music (Bleach always had the best bangers of all the big 3), the animation, it's peak anime. Judging just solely off an artistic standpoint Bleach TYBW is what other animes strive to achieve and it might be the nostalgia talking but I don't even care, I have no regrets giving it a 10/10. Bleach was once at the top, beating out everyone and had insane potential. You can tell that the studio and everyone working on this is really passionate about finishing off one of the most iconic anime with the justice it deserves, and as a fan who long awaited for it's final arc to be animated I couldn't be happier with what we got.",10,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_557e24ab21,8,875
"What's interesting about the storyline The story is definitely not predictable especially for anime onlys, overall for the story it was awesome, sometimes mind-blowing, especially On that one episode was shown, where the Head Captain Yamamoto Shigekuni Genryusai was fighting against the Quincy King, Yhwach, the animation was Top-tier, words can't describe how awesome that episode was, but I can ASSURE you, it was DEFINITELY better than that new season of Demon Slayer (Demons got defeated, u know the scene where demon siblings was in a total defeat, both d£cap!tated, died side by side). The massive plot-twist at the end of episode 9 also caught us all off-guard despite the Head Captain Yamamoto showing-off his enormous and monstrous powers (4 Bankai destroying ""Yhwach"") It was a huge disastrous Brute Force against Brilliant Strategy. the Zangetsu = Not really Zangetsu, but rather, the appearance of the Quincy King, 2000 Years ago, legit I was in a massive shook. Y'all won't believe it, my reaction and legit every youtube reactors faces was in TOTAL DISBELIEF, MASSIVE SHOOK hits us hard. The Animation Quality The animation for the art style IS MOST DEFINITELY fits the story 100%, I even consider it's better than the colored manga, NGL TO Y'ALL.. The visuals, artworks, animation quality is a SPOT ON! To the point where it rivals the Demon Slayer new season's OP animation quality, and don't get me wrong! Both has showed us amazing visuals so far. Not to mention the gore visualized from the very start of the episode to eps 13, the brutality, the gore, ruthlessness of the characters was WILD. 💀 I'd like to name every Dangerously OP, characters with Top-Tier Powers of both Warring Factions. Gotei 13 & their second in Command: 1.The Head Captain (Commander in Chief): Yamamoto Shigekuni Genryūsai, age: over 2 milleniums (+2000 Years Old) Powers: Ryūjin Jakka, the Blade of the Enormous Flame, Bankai: East, West, South & North (details on *spoiler alert* episode 9, old man Yama VS Yhwach) 2. Zaraki Kenpachi (Captain), Dangerous man, considered as one of the 5 Special Threats issued by the Quincy King. Powers: Extremely Durable, Relentless Brutal Strikes, Ruthless Deadly Slashes, Overwhelming amount of Spiritual Pressure, Gets stronger everytime he receives strikes. 3. Kyōraku Shinsui (Lately Appointed Head Captain) Powers: He can teleport straight behind, under, and within enemy's shadows to perform a deadly strike, Dual-wielding Zanpakuto user. Deadly and wide huge scale of Bankai radius. He appears weak but deep down, he's too dangerous and cold-blooded. Bankai: Katen Kyokotsukaramatsu Shinju. 4. Aizen Sōsuke (Currently under 20.000 Year of Sentence). A cold-blooded Four-eyes mf, Zanpakuto: KyokaSuigetsu (Complete Hypnosis); He can put every individuals including those with OP traits under his mirage, fake and full of hypnosis, after making visual contact on his Zanpakuto), he can freely put everybody under complete hypnosis whenever he wills. Has reached a higher type of entity above Quincy, Espada, Soul Reapers, Arrancar & Hollows. 5. Urahara Kisuke (Former Captain put under Exile of the Previous Gotei-13) ALSO considered as one of the 5 Special Threats issued by the Quincy King, Master of Tricks, Urahara Kisuke. Mastered every type of Kido & Bakudo, Possess a very mysterious Bankai (a bizarre and deadly one). 6. Kurosaki Ichigo The characters are nice and well written, especially in the colored manga where the details are included. But when they all comes alive in the anime, everything is absolutely SPOT ON and legit comes out with each characters has their own unique and power traits, from the very Top to Low Tier level. Both factions (Gotei 13 & Sternritter) each with their own crazy amount of spiritual pressures and deadly firepowers (legit I mean, they're like the PHD's when it times to brutal k!llings, relentless ch()ppings, slash!ng their enemies with no mercy nor any remorse was truly horrifying, and I'm being honest with y'all, it could affect you psychologically, mentally and it sticks to your minds once you guys witness the brutality shown in the anime like a super glue. None of us manga readers was expecting the gore, none of us manga readers expected any brutality in this massive 10-years long awaited return, and the victims of those brutalities was visualized so real thanks to the voice actors, the screaming, terrifying high-pitched screaming in agony caught us all manga readers off-guard.",10,Recommended,"Jan 2, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_a96811d1e1,8,4479
"I’ve watched bleach a little in the past but never watched past the soul society arc (which I thought was good). With the announcement of this season, I watched from start to finish in order to catch up and be able to watch weekly with friends. Let me say this…: This is EASILY one of my favourite arcs in Bleach, THE RISK, SENSE OF DANGER, REMIXED OSTs, EPISODE TITLE REVEALS, POEMS, ART DIRECTION, THE SYMBOLISM the list goes on and on!! For those who are saying that “it feels rushed” and “seems boring with boring music and dialogue” I’d say coming off of the previous seasons it does not seem rushed (picking up essentially right where it left off after the fullbringer arc) and pacing has been AMAZING. Fights have been animated beautifully and the stakes are kicked up to 💯 If it’s been years since you’ve watched the previous seasons I’d recommend a recap video on YouTube at least first before diving in.

"Bleach is back, and I couldn't be happier. I had previously watched some anime, but Bleach sparked my interest in both anime and Japanese culture back around 2011/2012. That's why I was so excited to hear about the sequel. I've already finished the Manga, so I know what's going to happen, but that doesn't take away from my excitement. And I was not let down. The story resumes where it left off ten years ago. The entire plot line is typical shonen, so it's a little predictable. But Bleach has a captivating atmosphere, mixed with beloved characters and some comedy relief. And the Thousand-Year Blood War arc has one significant advantage over the prequel. There is no need for filler episodes because the Manga is already completed, so the storytelling is not disrupted. Splitting the entire arc into separate courses benefits another aspect as well. I've always thought that Bleach has some intense fight scenes, and that for the sequel, they had enough time to properly animate them. The fights between Yhwach and Yamamoto, as well as Yhwach and Ichigo, look incredible. It gave me goosebumps, and I didn't look away from the screen for a second (and I'm easily distracted). The entire Anime was then complemented by a magnificent soundtrack, as you would expect from Bleach. Overall, I'm looking forward to the next courses. Even though waiting can be aggravating, I'm confident it will be worthwhile. I had grown tired of anime, but Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen revived my interest in it.",10,Recommended,"Dec 29, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_65a8b26f0f,9,1494

"Good, so to cut the introduction stuff cuz it's boring and everyone knows what the series is about, I just want to say WOW. It never occured to me that I would have reactions like dropped jaw and wide opened eyes, even crying of emotion from an anime. Of course, I cried on many animes, but never on Bleatch and it was not from sadness. My best friend told me about Bleach. Her brother have watched it, she didn't get to (yet), but she bought a set of playing cards with the bleach characters she found in a second hand store. ( i'm hella jealous now). Well after debating on which anime I should start a year ago or so....maybe more...I started Bleach. It was nice I enjoyed It with all the fillers. All of them. Special hate from me to the haters >_< just skip them if u don't like that. After I finished watching the series I tagged it as my favourite anime. I thought It had a nice ending and that was good enough for me even tho the actual happy ending of the manga was not animated. I didn't know much about the manga at the time. When I heard that in 2022 there's going to be a continuing season I was like <oh, okay...so there is a sequel. Nice I'd like to see that> I watched this season and had me literally going crazy. Everything in every single episode was perfect. Especially ep 12 and 13 that I just watched and had me dropping my jaw on the floor. I never thought I was going to like a series so much. I came to the conclusion that Tite Kubo is a freakin' genius. All the entities, the powers, the personalities of the characters he created, all amazed me. I even came to realise that aside from everything, Bleach slays in my heart in comparison to Naruto. Don't get mad at me, I love Naruto with all my might but it is just not the same bread, you know. And I know it is not supposed to be the same. I am not saying that Bleach is better. I just liked it more. But this is my humble opinion, and no one on earth can change it. I kept texting to my bestie after finishing these episodes <IT'S THE BEST. WATCH IT. I'M IN CLOUD NINE! THE BEST SERIES EVER> (literally said this) To conclude cuz I don't want to have you guys bored reading this, no anime is better than another. Why? You may think what I am saying is nonsense. Well, maybe. But not really. Every anime is built different. Created by different minds with different ideas and different visions about life. So we are not to judge on the concept of an art work. Just build an opinion about it and rate it based on our preferences. But never say ""anime x is better than anime y"". Because that is the actual nonsense. Hope you guys enjoyed this review ( if you got to read it till the end please give me a sign. I just want to be heared out). Have a nice life and enjoy the animes you like, stop spreading hate.

"All hail, the best anime of the year! For almost a decade, one of ""big three"" has finally came back with its arc finale. What else to say, every episodes is superb! It still have the impact and entertainment value that I've felt years ago. A Thousand Years Blood War Arc is something that has too many stories to tell and all of it are worthy to be tackled. The one thing I love bleach is that it has an abundant variety of characters that has definetely something big to offer to the story. The only time that Ichigo literally shine from this season is during the last episode since it was all about his families' history. But the rest of the episodes has been well driven by notable characters such as Old Man Yama and Retsu Unohana.

"Been waiting for Bleach to continue since the orginal series stopped airing back in 2012. So far TYBW has amazing animation and is more graphic in nature, as compared to the previous series, which fits Bleach very well. That ED on the first episode was straight fire and nostalgic for all the OG Bleach fans. The color scheme of the anime is great as well, with the animation being head and shoulders above what we've seen before in this show. The music is good too, but definitely not as great as the first series. I don't mind them remixing the original songs, but at least make them sound decent. There's one track in particular that adds in a high pitched electric guitar that makes the entire thing sound terrible. Something I'm worried about is the progression of the story, if each season in TYBW has 13 episodes, I hope they have enough time to flush out the entire manga without leaving too much out. In the worst case scenario, I'll end up going back to read the manga but we'll see how it goes. Hopefully the upcoming seasons will build upon the solid foundation this season has layed down.

"This is a well produced continuation of Bleach. It seems to stick to the old formula. Writing this at Episode 5, let me summarize what got so far. We've been introduced to a new threat. Kurosaki still is stronger than the average dude there and a needless introduction of well established characters doesn't happen. I conclude, this means it was primarily made for fans of the prequel. If you havent watched that or if you didnt like it, I do not recommend watching this (yet) either. However, if you liked the prequel, you really should watch this. Of course, it suffers from the same issues the prequel had, like waiting for certain characters to make progress when you expect them to, and a lot going on at once at multiple places, which can be annoying/hard to follow but that is part of this show, I guess. Personal recommendation: Wait until it finished airing so you can binge watch it. As you may remember, bleach loves cliffhangers and Episode 5 is a prime example here. We got everything in this episode. Battle, an overall dire situation, a ray of hope, foreshadowing, a character who was unexpected to take the spotlight for the moment and a trigger for the urge to yell ""i need next episode right now"" at our screens. If you feel the need to compare it to the manga, go rate the manga, the page is there and it's all yours. Keep in mind, that this is still the animation, not the source material, of course it is different in places and apparently has a rearranged order of things, so it fits well within the episodes time frame.",8,Recommended,"Nov 7, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_33ecc3f662,9,1542
"Bleach TYBW gives an insanely amazing comeback to a long ended shounen anime without adapting the final arc of the manga. Starting from the characters to the animation, Bleach TYBW improves a lot. The final arc is a serious and bloody one, with a lot of fights and the first cour is just a start. Pierrot has done an amazing job in splitting the cours, which will not impact the overall production of the final arc, which resumes after 10 years.

"The OG of BIG 3, the anime where everyone knows what is shounen, the anime where many childhood growns in television in west,asia and europe whatever the brand who took the license for in 2004/2005 and last but not least the anime most of the viewer liking the protagonist, relatable like him(most part of it), wear a good fashion so we got a taste and linked with the series wether it was bad,neutral,good or best period. That's bleach, the series long ended without the continuation in the manga. throwing a bad taste for how rush it is but when it adapt as animation, not only it improve some part of what lack in the material but also blowing all expectation for how good it is! Not only they cut the unnecesary part in the manga but also improve the IMPORTANT moment in the adaptation! When eps 1 came out just be clear, all of you who watch this must be crying alot right? Especially when special ending comes you must be nostalgic the journey of this series comes right? Yeah me too! Not only that, the big moment in eps 6,7,10-13 making it more spotlighted than what people need. But even with cliffhanger in eps 13 it makes all of us excited for july 2023 in cour 2! Pierrot truly makes an forgiveable what they do in the past and we can takes a credit for the staff who works this series so hard in the sake of consistency quality and pacing they give! Cour 2 deserve for our expectation especially when tite kubo admit that he works so hard for cour 2 makes him only get to sleep in 2-3 am. In overall i'm always love bleach so much. this series is part of my childhood growing, opening the gates of anime if i don't know bleach is and lastly it feels so good to be excited like this just like my young self every weekend stay tune for just bleach even i have to wait 7 months it's okay, 10 years can be waiting for this to be so good even cour 2!",10,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0b5dd85de9,9,1858
"Just a masterpiece. Beware, watch this ONLY if you have seen Bleach before. Otherwise you won't understand. Here you get to know many answers that the old series was lacking. Honestly, I am an old fan, I followed Bleach because it was a very interesting and a fresh idea at the time. Sadly, as time was passing, Bleach felt very weird for me and declined a lot. The last chapters felt very rushed and since the end years ago, I felt really bittersweet about everything. It was because Bleach was good, but then I felt it all went to waste. Now, as a returning fan in 2022, I can't believe how lucky I am to be alive and have the pleasure to enjoy this sequel. I'm speechless, it was just wonderfull. The first chapters felt a bit weird (maybe I was just trying to adapt again), but then it just became a wild adventure. I am 100% satisfied with this.

"I went into this having read the manga to completion years ago, and full well knew what to expect when watching. Despite that I was continuously blown away by how incredible this adaptation was. Studio Pierrot delivered on every front they possibly could've. The animation and visuals are gorgeous, the soundtrack including all of the remixes are amazing, the voice acting (subbed and dubbed) is great, and the addition of new scenes really adds to the experience. If there's one front that the series did struggle with it was how fast paced it was and that leading to some scenes from the original manga needing to be cut. That being said most of what was cut were small gag scenes or ones that don't really add much to the overall story, which results in the more oppressive and hopeless mood that this arc of the story is trying to portray. If you are a fan of the series and haven't completed the manga, I recommend this. If you have finished the manga I still recommend it.

"When I watched Bleach initially in 2016, I fell in love with Kubo's work. The show felt like it had a life of its own, and out of the big 3, it was quickly my favorite, which is why I felt so disappointed when it finished airing. The final episode of the initial Bleach left me feeling extremely discontent. Not only did it not actually wrap up the story because it needed to include the entire final arc, but the arc we left off on was one of the weakest in the series. Looking back on it, I realized my issues with the show. The original Bleach anime could have paced significantly better. Often, episodes would drag out things that didn't need to be dragged out, and on top of that, a large amount of poorly written filler added to my distaste. The Bount Arc, for example, was one of, if not the worst, story arcs I have ever watched in all of fiction. The anime's presentation significantly hindered its phenomenal music and well-designed characters. The action, which gave off an air of intensity in the manga, was dragged out to a point where it became almost boring. So what did the new Bleach anime change that makes it so good? It's easy; they cut out all the bullshit. Thousand Year Blood War cuts out all the extra crap and gives us just the story. Bleach is a manga masterpiece, and the only thing holding it back in the past was its poor pacing and disgustingly lousy filler. Without that, the story is very well written. The anime stays utterly faithful to the source material, and because of that, it feels much more engaging. On top of this, the additional time the animators had to work on the project and the fact that the manga is currently finished gives them much more flexibility to work around when it comes to the show. This allows Kubo's writing and character design to shine while also being boosted by the beautiful music from studio Mappa and gorgeous animation and fight choreography. Thousand Year Blood War is the perfect anime adaptation. Full stop.

"I watched Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War without knowing anything about Bleach, aside from reading maybe the first 10 volumes of the manga about 10 years ago, and I gave it a 9 at first. The action, animation, and OST are all top-notch. It's easy to appreciate this anime without knowing what an Arrancar or a Bankai is, but then I went back and read all of bleach from the beginning, just to see what exactly it was that I just watched. Having understood the plot of bleach raised my already high appraisal of the series. This adaptation does everything a superb adaptation does. Aside from adding stunning visuals and music, the adaptation makes important details more obvious than the original material apparent. Both the Dub and the Sub are quite strong. I think the best way to enjoy Bleach would be to read the manga up until the Blood War arc, and then switch to the anime, as I think that the manga is superior until the 1000 year blood war. That's what made me give it a 10. It's a good thing they waited to adapt the final arc. No one would be talking about Bleach with as high esteem had this come out with the original anime adaptation's production value.

"BLEACH IS BACK BABY!! As a Bleach fan I cannot express how happy I feel with Bleach being back with its full glory. fans have been waiting since the manga ended in 2016 for the TYBW to get animated and their waiting was not for nothing, as it is being animated by peirrot but this time with a good budget unlike the previous arc. Just hearing BANKAI again made me cry. The story follows where the anime ended in 2011 with quinces invading the Soul Society and Ichigo getting involved with this war like usual. I won’t spoil anything so I will keep it simple by not adding anything else. This final arc animation is like a love letter to the fans with it being compared to other big anime studios like Madhouse,Mappa,etc.The colors are vibrant, the lighting is amazing, and don’t get me started on the fights which are on another level compared to the old anime. Now lets talk about the voice actors. They are just amazing, you can feel that they are giving it their all working on this with their feelings for the series being transmitted through voicing these characters passionately. The music in Bleach is amazing as usual with Shiro Sagiso showing again how he is the god of anime music. I have nothing but praise for the production of this arc and can’t wait to see more of it.

"In all honestly I think from what I saw so far, I think this first season alone is way better than the entirety of the original bleach. I love original bleach but the more I rewatch this season, the more I praise it. The overall quality when it comes to the characters, animation, soundtrack, and the artstyle is just too damn perfect. I was never around at the time the manga ended in 2016 but I remember people back then said that the anime wasn't coming back, bleach is dead, the final arc won't get animated. During winter of 2021 , we get our first new trailer for the new thousand year blood war anime and my gosh does it look so damn good. It was announced it that the new season was coming out in October 2022. I've heard that Tite Kubo is behind the production of the this new bleach anime. Now I'm reviewing this amazing season and boy was it tasty. I've been drinking the hell out of bleach for 2 years and to this day I'll never get tired of it. Art: It's such a huge understatement to say that the art was a massive improvement over the original 2004 anime. Not saying the original was bad by any means but the new art completely clears the original. It makes me appecirtate kubo's valiant efforts even more to give us bleach fans what we deserve. We've been thirsty for more bleach for years after all. Characters: We still have our same and good ol' karakura gang we've known for years fighting to protect each other for the sake of the human world. Our beloved substitute soul reaper Ichigo, our beautiful orange-haired orihime, chad, and uryu. The iconic gotei 13 also still remain what they were for 20 years and that's fight to protect the soul society. In this arc we get introduced to a new faction called the wandenreich army, who are next-level quincy's with new abilities we've never seen before that are infinitely stronger than uryu. Story: Our new antagoinst Yhwach and his quincy army known as the wandenreich quickly storms in the head captain's office sending a message that they were going to declare war on the soul society and to set a example, they killed the head captain yammamoto's lieutenant and killed numerous other shinigami. They even set an example by killing many hollows in Hueco Mundo. Basically the rivals of the shinigami and quincy never get along because of shinigami killing hollow so the souls can be sent to the soul society but the quincy decides to kill the hollows because it's kind of like a disease to them. The karakura gang except for Uryu, who is the fishy one of the show, travels across the garganta to hueco mundo to save the remaining surviving hollows. Yhwach takes advantage of that by sending his sternritter crew to invade the soul society but the gotei 13 are not down for the count yet. Ichigo eventually heads to the soul society to protect his comrades from the destruction of the Seritei. Animation: Not only is the animation an improvement over the original, but also it's very gory compared to the original. If I had one special early Christmas present, I would love for a remake of original bleach. Me speaking as a bleach fan, I do wish that the original was as gory as the new season. Even the manga is way gory than the original anime it's not even close. The color effects of both the quincy and the gotei 13 are so damn beautiful. There are still some stiff shots just like the original but the colors and special effect in general do make up for it. Conclusion: This is easily the best this show has ever looked. I really do love the war setting of this show. It's dark, gory, serious most of the time, and there's insane plot twists as the series goes on. Any die hard bleach fan that watches this will have an amazing time. I will say the pacing is sorta fast towards the beginning which people won't be a fan of, but kubo did state he was going to be cutting most of the comedic moments and others that he thinks, I thought the pacing was fine. He did say as well that he's adding new anime exclusives and extending plot points that wasn't explained enough in the manga which is a massive w. I have very high expectations that the thousand year blood war arc will do justice for the manga.",10,Recommended,"Aug 4, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0b962db04e,9,4175

"first of all, I am a big fan of bleach and I finished the first part so if you are like me, of course, I would recommend you to watch it so, is it worth a watch? Well, the answer doesn’t matter at all there is no way you are not watching this if you have already watched the rest of it and you like the anime and hope to get a conclusion and if you are not I really don't know why are you watching it I guess to just spread hate again the fans got the rewards of their wait and patience because everything got way better in this arc on all levels: The art style, the music, the story, and the animation are fantastic, you can't ask for anything better than this. and from The first episode, the anime will surpass your expectations everything about the anime was amazing words can't fully express how amazing it was I easily can say Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen has been much better than any of us probably expected and that is reflected in its rank on MAL.which shows how much people are enjoying this season p.s this part has three of the best fight scenes I ever watched in bleach maybe after Ichigo vs Ulquiorra and anime overall summary We have reached the end of the first chapter out of the 4 parts of the Thousand Year War - Bleach, a war that brought together two poles, and between them, there is an ancient history written in blood! - The Quincy led by King Yhwach, who announced the beginning of the planned invasion since he suffered the greatest loss that almost ended the Quincy dynasty and dried it from existence on the Soul Society, which is under the protection of the Guti 13 led by the man who killed thousands of them 200 years ago, Yamamoto Genryusai - The movement of the Vandenreich forces sparked a declaration of war, in which the deputy commander of the 1st Division, Sasakibe, was the first chess piece to fall, followed by a series of massive losses incurred by the Gotei 13: Commander Kuchiki Byakuya, Deputy Commander Abarai Renji, robbed the Bankai of several commanders, which led to the curbing of the main force of the Shinigami and Deterring It Perhaps the greatest loss to the Soul Society since the inception of Gote 13 was the fall of Supreme Commander Yamamoto Genryusai - Quincy's forces did not suffer major losses, and compared to what was already achieved, the first battle in this war was a crushing victory for Vandenreich's forces, but! Winning the battle does not necessarily necessitate winning the war, and the time granted by the Quincy King by ordering his followers to temporarily withdraw after slaughtering the Guardian of Hell for Goethe 13 may pay his soul for it! - Instead of the complete annihilation of the enemies, especially with their morale and fighting spirit shattered, after the fall of the pillar on which their leader and the teacher had their backs to each other, Yhwach tended to withdraw for reasons that are currently still unknown to anime followers! - At this time, the Gotei had already begun to gather itself together, and after appointing Kyorak Shinsui as the successor to his mentor in command of the last 13 Gotei forces, he began to weave his strategy to turn the tables and restore dignity to the Shinigami community, and we will witness the effectiveness of this man's leadership in the upcoming second part. Bleach has never looked better. Thousand-Year Blood War presents an impressive transformation for the series that hopefully will continue throughout the run. Action scenes are crisp and inventive. Quincies are a terrifying villain group that is very effectively established with minimal screentime. The anime mostly elevates the source material, often improving upon the original work.

War is not like any other shonen with the main character somehow getting more power with the power of friendship preventing casualties which always happen in a war. Bleach now gives a very dark vibe and the '' good '' side loses so much more than they ever did. It nearly begs the question; if good wins was it even worth it in the end? It seems there is alot of strategy involved in the war, which is a good thing. Alot of shonens give off the hack and slash vibe. Where as this arc shows how much strategy plays a part in either winning or losing a war. They have removed alot of humor panels in very serious situations which maintains the nailbiting experience. It truly feels that this enemy can put an end to everything and anyone can die. All-in-all; if you love bleach, this is the best and most accurate arc to date. This is how bleach always should have been. The animation is absolutely fantastic and they pay alot of tribute to original manga panels that had a big effect on the readers back when it released.

"Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War will be a great thing to watch for existing fans of Bleach, the potential opportunity to address the shortcomings of the manga is there, but, its faults lay precisely in the fact that is drawing material from a flawed work. That being said, quality of animation is stunning at times, and the pacing seemed fine for the most part with some caveats through the first 7 episodes. For those looking for a nostalgia trip, its certainly there, with a familiar cast of beloved characters thrown into the events of the Thousand Year Blood War. Would people without prior exposure to Bleach find the same sort of enjoyment and excitement as I've gained from watching these 8 episodes? I don't think so as this is the final arc of a story that spanned 15 years, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything there for new viewers. Kubo certainly has his flaws in his writing, character development is wanting at times, with many members of the supporting cast showing potential to be great characters, only to be canned into irrelevance. This flaw is probably tied with one of his greatest strengths and that is his ability to generate a myriad of characters with unique designs, especially when it comes to their actual skillset , weapons, and abilities. I suppose when you do have the ability to generate and manage a medley of characters through the story, although each introduction can serve to further the plot in particular direction, it could leave the development of your existing characters wanting, much in the same way as existing characters in games are power crept to irrelevance by a burgeoning cast of new characters. Although it appears that he was able to relay to the animation studios things he wanted to change and address, it remains to be seen how he will address the weaker point of the stories in the later arcs. When he was writing the manga, his publishers and editors were known to push deadlines and were disparaging of his work, which of course lead to his writing of the story in a way that he didn't like, leading to a hasty and doomed drive to wrap up the story as it were. There were a-lot of moments that were ""off-screened"" in the manga that resulted in less than satisfying experience for readers. With that being said, the show is greenlit for 4 seasons, it remains to be seen if Kubo was able to work on the story after its serialization had ended, and if the changes he made effectively improves the story or not. I wont get into the details of the female characters and their design as much as other comments, but I will say that he does like to draw a particular type of female character. Its a quite noticeable and might feel irksome to some, here is the umpteenth character with this particular design mold, but, I don't feel like it detracts from the merits of the overarching story. If you like Shounens, and something in the vein of Dragon Ball, this thing is for you, if you're looking for something more psychological, something that invokes a deeper sense of emotion, something more cerebral and of substance then this work will feel a bit more wanting.",9,Recommended,"Nov 29, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_6ed7e6cd31,10,3122

"Bleach is one of the most awaited releases of 2022, and the hype surrounding it in the last two years was impressive. Having Pierrot and Tomohisa Taguchi (Akudama Drive) in charge of the production being two other major reasons for its pre-release long wait. Due to how there was a lot of hype before its release and the noise it is making, I decided to write a little about the best release of 2022. The story (yes, mr X who complained, here it is once more) revolves around the rise of Yhwach – or JuhaBach –, the Father of all Quincies and the biggest enemy of Yamamoto Genryuusai, the leader of the Soul Society. The first moment Ichigo and his friends become aware of it, is when a small-time Quincy called Ebern drops by the young Shingami’s bedroom window. Turns out that Ebern wanted to steal Ichigo’s bankai, which he couldn’t for reasons that are explained later. The battles in this last arc are the most intense and groundbreaking in the entire Bleach’s universe. Most of the shinigamis that didn’t have their bankais properly shown finally do it here and, above all, we learn more about Ichigo’s past. “Everything But The Rain” is the climax of his story, and is as surprising as it gets. In this saga, I started to view Isshin (Ichigo’s father) through different lens. His plot and encounter with Masaki makes him look way more mature than Kubo showed previously, to the point that Isshin turns into a different person if that makes sense. In TYBW, I noticed how they increased Uryu’s role a little more, and I hope they do it more, since he is a major part of this arc. Of course, not all characters can share a proper screentime, but at least do some justice for the main characters that were thrown to the side. TYBW is the second opportunity Kubo and Pierrot have to make it different, and this adaptation is impressing me episode by episode. The quality of this title is really a point worth mentioning. The idea behind the split of seasons was satisfying to me, since the cast in charge of production needs to rest, in order to make the content the best possible. With 4 seasons and 13 episodes each, I couldn’t ask for a more suitable and proper way to treat this series. The opening and ending, although not as memorable as the one in the 2004 series, still nails it and is worthy of being part of Bleach’s project. The animation quality is sometimes great sometimes “good”, but I won’t blame names here since we can’t expect always-high tier animation in any work, due to the amount of money needed. All in all, Pierrot is really redeeming themselves from the crime of using Amagai saga to interrupt Ichigo x Grimmjow xD Another point worth mentioning is the amount of anime-only/new content, which makes the whole story better paced (the opposite of the fast pacing in the manga). Considering the quantity of chapters adapted, and how much road is still ahead, I’m expecting a full season of new material. Or at least a better explained conclusion, picking Narita’s novels and bright and heavily rewritten ideas from Kubo’s mind. Even though most battles in this arc are originally just like Fake Karakura’s saga, in this second anime we have a deeper dive in the lore of Bleach; and a more suitable perspective of each of them involved. Zaraki vs Unohana’s fight is a proof of this care.

"It's been a while since I reviewed anything, a while since I actually watched anything, years in fact. So why not continue with Bleach's new offering. The first reservation I had for me loving this was simply I was never the biggest fan of Bleach to begin with. However, I put this to one side and chose this to kick start my watching of anime once more and was actually pleasantly surprised at first. It throws you into the story straight away, no waiting, though you still must endure the token irritating, over scared character a lot of anime is cursed with. Thankfully, this irritation goes away and brings you back into the story quickly. It proceeds rather nicely into progressing what this season will detail and delivers great action sequences with some minor surprises in plot. The major bugbear I had with this is everything just seems rather unexplored. The desire to progress quickly with the plot comes at the expense of character building and I really felt this could have easily been a 25 ep season. Don't get me wrong, the 'moments' are really great. In-between these 'moments' however feels rushed and lacks the building of the dynamic we as anime fans come to expect from major anime titles such as Bleach. The animation has no flaws. It's no Demon Slayer, but what is really? It's does the job very nicely and though not groundbreaking, does everything it needs to do to be more than satisfactory. Music is awful. It's as simple as that. Moments of true emotion conveyed with essentially a b-movie version of Lethal Weapon soundtrack. Poorly thought through, lazy and very close to 'moment' killing. It's good, I can't say anymore, not brilliant, not amazing, but what I can say for sure, it's got me back into watching anime again and that most certainly is a good thing",7,Mixed Feelings,"May 1, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_b3ef266736,10,1790
"First off, Congratulations to all Bleach Fans. I am happy for you guys, your beloved franchise celebrated a glorious 20th Anniversary with an absolute banger of an anime. Now for the Review TL;Dr 9/10 = If you are a Bleach fan, it's a love letter. If you aren't then you might want to read the next para and skip to the Conclusion at the bottom. Be warned that watching this arc's adaption blind (without context) is gonna leave you confused. Watching it blind is not the ideal experience. However, the fight scenes, the music, animation, narrative consistency and the Emotional Highs are done so well they can be Universal. So if you do decide to watch it blind, you will be in for a fun (albeit confusing) time Artistic and Fun: 2/2 The animation is top notch which makes fights incredibly fun to watch. The music is on point and hype. The narrative build up to the fights makes them impactful and their resolution truly something captivating. As far as fun goes, this is definitely fun. Huge credits to the studio for making it artistically sound with wide panning shots and dynamic camera work that makes for amazing visual story telling. Recommended: 1/2 While the anime is a work of art and highly enjoyable, I'm afraid it is unfairly saddled with the burden of needing 300 episodes worth of anime context. The amount of commitment to see through that I argue is better spent watching FMAB (64), AoT (25+12+22+28) and Steins;Gate (25 +24) which all neatly add up to 200 episodes. The pay off for each anime is immensely huge and I argue far greater than what this arc could give you. However, for Manga readers, people who have been following Bleach for a long time or dropped it couple of years back (meaning you have enough knowledge up to the Hueco Mundo Arc) they will definitely enjoy it. Those who haven't will struggle to understand and I don't blame them, plus the reveal at the end might ruin the 300 episodes preceding it as it is a Darth Vader level reveal. Narrative Consistency: 2/2 I used to hate on Bleach back in the day because for some reason it felt to me the franchise was all about making Ichigo relevant to everything in existence. Also the Ywach reveal felt wrong to me, rather that re contextualizing it felt like I was being told everything I saw was a lie. However, watching the anime and how they handled the same plot points but only gave them a good treatment presentation wise. I suddenly respect all the developments infinitely more. From Episode 1 - 12, you are never lost (assuming you have context of Bleach) regarding what is happening. The Plot, Complication, the Climax are always in play and result in a very satisfying Resolution upon completion. Even for someone who hasn't touched Bleach in a decade I was able to quickly grasp and understand the significance of a plot point, the vector of the complication (where and why it's headed) with the resulting Climaxes being truly amazing. This proper use of a narrative cycle keeps going and has layers, truly a well made anime. Emotional Highs: 2/2 Defined as moments that evoke strong emotion, be it Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Laughter or even Thought Provoking that can leave you speechless. United States of Smash, the unveiling of the master plan in FMAB and Okabe's Operation Arclight are good examples. Minimum 3 moments = 2 points Suffice to say, Bleach has a great many Emotional highs. From the fight scene of Old Man Yamamoto against Ywach, Kenpachi's awakening, Ichigo's awakening, the Origins of Ichigo, Ichigo vs Ywach and even Byakuya's fight are all packed to the brim with emotion that will leave you in tears or at the edge of your seat. So there is no shortage of moments that are totally worth the build up for. Bias: 2/2 (mentioned after the next 3 paras) Bleach has a very well made Power System regarding Bankais, Zampaktos, Hollows and Quincy's. Their limitations are also well explained and often what eventually lead to proper conflict resolution. This entire arc struggles the idea of what it means to be a Soul Reaper, what it means to be a Quincy and even the question that supersedes it all: ""Can Quincy's and Soul Reapers coexist?"" While it isn't handled in the complete depth as it should, I suspect it will be later, it is still deep enough to merit having my interest. Time is not spent on idly pondering upon them, most time is spent doing and acting on things with these ideas being the backdrop of the conflicts at hand. Bleach has good world building, with the idea of the Soul Society, Hueco Mundo and now the new enemy that shows up all being explained and belonging in the world rather than being parasitical extensions of it (Meaning we are not forced to assume too much) In fact the main complication stems from a long winded History the Soul Reapers have with the Quincy which in turn is thanks in part to how well the world is made. It isn't as great as Isekai's like Re zero and Mushoku Tensei, Cyberpunk settings like Edge Runners or even Fantasy like Overlord. However, it is significant enough to be merited with having a strong sense of History. My biases: Magic Systems, Idealogue and History Magic Systems: Any system with strict (Hard) or implied (Soft) restrictions of what it's capable of qualifies as a Magic System for the purposes of this Review. Be it FMAB's Law of Equivalent Exchange, Steins;Gate's World Lines or Dr Stone's Science History: Real world History or World Building and Lore based History. Re Zero and Overlord have vibrant Worlds with their own fleshed out History, Races, Relations, Politics and Factionalism. Bonus points for Natural Phenomenon Unique to their worlds. Whereas Youjo Senki / Saga of Tanya the Evil takes direct inspiration from WW1. Idealogue: Deep and Thought Provoking takes on contemporary or otherwise archaic matters. Be it Intangible stuff like Justice and Meaning of Life, or something achievable like being the Best at X and the ramifications of being so. My favorite is the Idea of being a King, and the concept of a King in general. Conclusion: 9/10 This anime is a love letter to Bleach fans, be it those who have been following it and sticking with it since the start or those who followed it somewhat. I have 0 complaints with everything done and would recommend it to every Bleach fan. However, as for casual observers, I cannot recommend this as they will likely be confused and the experience will be ruined for them as this is an adaption of the final arc. Neither would I recommend someone to start Bleach as a consequence of this anime, I believe your time is better spent watching FMAB, Steins;Gate and Attack on Titan S1-4. Their collective episodes are still 100 less than the Bleach anime, and the pay off is significantly better in the aforementioned compared to Bleach. Therefore, I'd say this anime is best intended for people who already know about Bleach and it is a top tier anime adaption at that.

"Most fans know that the manga storyline sucked. What's worse, they probably aren't planning to change the storyline in anime. HOWEVER, the production team did such an incredible job that you simply cannot give this anime a bad rating given this level of animation, graphics, atmosphere, temper, narration, and expression. Storyline aside, this is no doubt an 11/10 masterpiece. Not a single detail was imperfect. Even if the storyline is taken into account, the production team clearly expressed this story in the best way possible so that the story does not look as bad as it was in manga years ago.

The opening, story, animation, characters, and ending are all top tier. I would definitely recommend this to others. It still lives up to its name as one of the big three even if the series was postponed SINCE 2012. I did not regret watching this series.

"This particular rendition of Bleach should be seen as a master-class of what an S-tier anime looks like. But let me be clear, that fact has nothing to do with the source material or the story (i.e Bleach). Obviously the source material being GOOD makes it an enjoyable watch. But the implementation of its presentation, art-style choice, animation quality, and filmography techniques take it from A-tier to S-tier. I can count on 1 hand the number of anime I'd rate as ""S-tier"" and just take a look at my list - 400+ complete titles, starting from early the 2000's (which I consider ""the golden age""). First, the tributes to nostalgia of early-2000s style anime making it truly feel ""Bleach"" are greatly welcomed. A beautifully animated OP with banger song, the short-cut previews with the OP still playing in lower volume afterwards, the sharp-edge art-style reinvigorated in glorious HD, the beautiful balancing of juxtaposition between comedy and seriousness. It's such a throw-back and it made the immersion feel like I was watching the OG Bleach. This was just great creative choices from the director(s)/producer(s) for the source material. Second, the artistic filmography techniques are just so skillfully implemented. The camera management is fluid, robust, and epic. The quick-cut emotional sequences, the rotation/panning during action sequences, the intensity of the up-close shots for shock-factor. This is the best it gets in the industry. Period. No contest. Also the animation quality, you can easily tell the sweat put into this; clearly all hand-drawn with a high number of key frames. The action sequences are so fluid its easily to tell. Truly top-class. That's all I really wanted to say. I'm glad to see such a quality anime release again; it took YEARS for it to happen, but it did. I was beginning to lose faith that any quality anime would be produced post-2015. The industry's quality has dropped as a whole due to content saturation, time-crunch culture, over-use of 3D, and just a lack of creativity from all the mass-production & enterprise-ownership of the industry (coughsonycough).

"My review my change when the story reach the final act of the final arc, however, I think Bleach is doing a fantastic job as a Long-running shounen manga, although that's not the case anymore with this seasonal core system, but you know what I mean. This arc started out on a high note, and it kept its momentum so far (EP10) with great production, direction and adaptation. I love the fact that Kubo himself is involved heavily this time, and I still think (or at least hope) that he's gonna pull a Hideaki Anno move, by changing the ending since the majority of the fans didn't like how the manga ended. that aside. Bleach has been amazing so far, loving every single episode, you don't even have time to catch your breath, it'd be really interesting to see how it's gonna be played out by the end of the series.",10,Recommended,"Dec 14, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0b9eb1ce50,10,814
"As a fan of ""Bleach"", I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen"", and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations. The animation and sound design were simply breathtaking, bringing the world of Bleach to life like never before. The attention to detail and the use of vibrant colors and dynamic action sequences created a visual feast that left me in awe. For those of us who have been following the series for years, this latest installment was a long time coming and it did not disappoint. It's amazing how the creators managed to maintain the spirit of the original while still taking it to new heights. From the character designs to the fight scenes, everything was handled with care and precision, making for an unforgettable viewing experience. One aspect that stood out to me was the incredible fight scenes. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that some of the most intense battles in the series take place in this installment. The choreography and animation work together seamlessly, delivering edge-of-your-seat excitement and thrilling action. Additionally, I was thrilled to see some familiar faces making their return to the screen. The appearance of certain characters added even more depth and excitement to the story, and their inclusion was handled perfectly. In conclusion, ""Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen"" is a must-watch for fans of the series and newcomers alike. Its stunning animation, pulse-pounding action, and masterful storytelling make it one of the best anime releases of recent years.

"What happens when you take one of the most beloved shonens of its era and give it a glow up that looks hard even by today's standard? The answer is both something that makes it to the top 10 of MAL's rankings, and something that isn't as good as you would expect from my description. The original Bleach running ended on a pretty good change of pace. The last arc had a pretty fantastic build up for a disappointing climax, when Kubo is normally an expert at doing the opposite. This arc also starts pretty well. It's tense despite suffering from the we need more syndrome all shonen anime go through, the new bad guy of the season is as charismatic as the last one and it seems that Kubo has figured out how to write a nice story instead of sticking to his usual talents of drawing hot women (hot everyone) and intense fights, though we're not lacking in the latter (the women's new designs are pretty much all a downgrade aside from Orihime, but assuming you watched the first run of Bleach, it's nothing new here). So, yeah, despite that brand new coat of paint and a new and improved story, Bleach is still Bleach. The character interactions have come a long way since the Soul Society Arc (almost bearable now) and sometimes the comedy is almost funny. I'll be looking forward to the continuation of the Thousand Year Blood War (this name will never not be too edgy), since some of the coolest characters have and wil get some much needed development.",7,Recommended,"Nov 12, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_49d606c18a,10,1456

"After all this time, still number one. Ten years after the original run of Bleach ended, Ichigo and company come roaring back, accompanied by savage new villains, and a stunning update in animation quality. For fans of the series, this is what we've waited for—the dazzling return of the Substitute Soul Reaper in all his action-packed glory. Any fears the reboot sequel wouldn't live up to the original have been thoroughly laid to rest. Story: New fans of the series should watch the original run first, because there is no tiresome exposition or recap. The story picks up where the original run left off, and everyone’s back for this next fight. The conflict between the Soul Society and Quincies erupts into war, leaving the Soul Reapers fighting for survival against their strongest foe yet. Along the way, major events from the past are re-contextualized and the very nature of Ichigo's abilities questioned. Characters: Plenty of fan-favorite characters get time in the spotlight. Several characters’ backgrounds are explored and long-standing mysteries are explained. The gang of antagonists, the Wandenreich, is chilling in their strength and ruthlessness. Yhwach, the leader of this fearsome army, makes for a menacing new enemy. Animation: The animation is a major highlight. Every scene is rendered in gorgeous style. From the black, white, and pink stylization of the opening theme and flashbacks to the awe-inspiring action scenes leaving one on the edge of their seat. The artistry of the series goes beyond anything before and evokes excitement and emotion in every frame. Music: Captures the iconic soundtrack of the original run with welcome additions and remixes, aiding in the action's suspense. Japanese Voice Cast: Voice work of the highest caliber, the cast reprise their roles as if no time has passed and delivers a worthy performance.

"In my heart this is a ten, babes, just know that. Well, it seems like everyone in the anime community was waiting for this revival, and I have to say: the resurgence of Bleach did not disappoint me. To start off with why I ended up scoring this a 9, it's basically down to the fact that not much can happen in 13 episodes with the type of story Bleach is (which is a Shounen that isn't afraid to take its time to tell a story properly, which I can't say for a lot of modern Shounen). The start of this season, while a whole nostalgia bomb for me, was slow, and the same can be said for the end of the season. Bleach manages to maintain interest throughout, though, regardless of what's going on, because... well, that's the byproduct when everything from the world to the characters to the conflict is electric. Some big things did happen this season that I'm glad the series was able to get to in this first leg of the Thousand Year Blood-War Arc adaptation, although I do wish this season could have been longer because, as it stands, it does seem a bit short-changed. Everything else surrounding the start of this arc, however, was incredible. The scoring for Bleach has always been good, but with ten years between anime adaptations, the improvements in art and animation blew me away nearly every episode. It really felt like nothing was spared; from the battles to the physical comedy to the characters' expressions, I was constantly impressed with this season and happy to see Bleach get such good treatment. I'm not sure what I can say about the rest of the season without spoiling anything, but I'll say that, although it does seem like it would have been a more well-rounded season had it been longer and included a bit more content from the manga. it still managed to end effectively and had very good pacing throughout. Of course, not only is the story told well, but the story itself is incredible in its own right (though I'm sure most who are reading this review and watching this season have read the manga, as well). Overall, I was very pleased with this return to Bleach, and I'm probably the most excited I've ever been about the continuation of an anime.

"If you're not familiar with Bleach and you're wondering if this show is actually good: it's not. ""Why is it ranked so high then?"" I hear you ask, quite simply because the Bleach fandom is hyped that the show is back and are massively hypevoting it. Both seasons of this new Bleach have great animation, and that's about it. If you're familiar with Bleach you might get some enjoyment from seeing all your favourite characters again. However in terms of story or dialogue this show is atrocious. In truth this show is really just an excuse to animate some cool fight scenes. Sadly almost all fights in this show follow the exact same pattern: a good guy uses a power, the opponent goes ""nani?!"", the good guy then explains the entire extend of their power (which is incredibly dumb), which the opponents then completely counters with their own power after understanding the ability. The opponent powers up and uses a new ability, the good guy goes ""nani?!"" and then the opponent explains their power, which the good guy then counters with their new power (or they get help from a friend). That's basically every fight in this show. It's laughably terrible how after literally every attack a character is compelled to explain what they just did. if you're not a Bleach fan, and you actually care about story this show is a hard skip. If you either like Bleach or cool action scenes give it a try I suppose.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 11, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_126d492e9c,11,1404

"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen is one of the most well-directed anime one could find. While I have not watched all of Bleach, I feel this arc has done a great job handling the sheer amount of content they had to work with as well as the time gap between the original anime run and this season's arc. With an enormous cast, it could be difficult to keep track of all the characters running about, but I think I was able to get the main gist of each character from character design and brief introductions. For example, the captains of Soul Society are all unique enough for me to remember who they are even though I would not be able to recite more than two of their names. This could be a flaw, but the director's choice to remove exposition in favor of moving the story along is a welcomed one for me. I would not, after all, want to spend an episode on a minor character unless it contributes to the story meaningfully. While the second half of this season has a lot less action compared to the first half, there are still the same highs in meaningful emotional moments for Ichigo which aid in valuable character development. The direction has a plethora of interesting choices like background color design and a show-no-tell style to the head captain's history. Much more importantly, to the general anime fan, is that animation has reached a new high. With intricate shading and refined movement, the animation gives life to an action-packed ""war"" that cannot be understated. The flames emitting from the blade, the holy light of the quincies, these are just some of the effects brought about with flying colors. There are a lot of great anime this season and, while the content for Bleach is the most daunting, it is the most worthwhile.",10,Recommended,"Dec 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_52bd7b5164,11,1737
"Return of the King. Holy crap does it feel amazing to be a Bleach fan in 2022(3). After all of the slander and character assassinate made over the years by Youtubers who don’t understand the difference between a passive and active protagonist, and an anime community more than willing to swallow and parrot the lies and rhetoric against the series like a Tori politician, not only has Bleach made the greatest anime comeback probably in the history of anime, but it is literally (as of the time of writing) ranked number 1 on MAL. Watching the amount of copium huffed by Bleach deniers to deal with how wrong all their bad takes have been over the years has been -for me- exquisite. As soon as the new remix of number 1 started popping off in the first episode and we were reintroduced to Ichigo, Chad, Orihime and Uryuu fighting hollows in a gloriously new, movie-quality animation style, I genuinely became emotional. Like old friends you haven’t seen in 10 years returning home for the first time (except they’re not real and I watch anime because I don’t have any real friends so I’m guessing that’s what it feels like). The Thousand Year Blood War is the final arc of the series (until Kubo starts working on that Hell arc) where all of the insanely well-thought-out foreshadowing starts to come together and questions about Ichigo’s power, his family and everything Rain included finally start being answered. Not only that, but Kubo -who worked on the anime with the team at Pierrot directly- not only had the final say on everything that was cut and changed but add additional story scenes where he couldn’t in the manga (because he ran out of time), meaning there’s no filler and everything that happens in TYBW anime is cannon. Also, I have to hand it to studio Pierrot. They do get shat on a lot for some of the anime they put out and for good reason (I like Black Clover, but god does the anime look like shit.), but in the hands of Taguchi, director of Akudama Drive, they can make anime gold when they want too. The tone depicted through colour, the lighting, and the animation coupled with Bleach composer Sagisu's new remixed OST that lead to some of the most amazing fights and scenes in the entire series, it’s just perfect! It was amazing to see everyone who watched TYBW weekly going through the same “holy fucking shit” moment online when they’d just finished an episode. This is what 10 years of preplanning looks like. Now, as much as I want to be a Bleach fanboy, whack on a 10/10 and call it a day, I can’t because I do have some criticism for the first Coeur, especially as someone who has read the manga hundreds of times. It’s great that Kubo permitted Taguchi to “aggressively cut” many of the jokes and lines/scenes that he deemed were irrelevant or repeated to not ruin the pacing. I was also one of those fans who was upset to see some of the humour cut, but around episode 8 I realised that to keep with the tone and the pacing it was the right call because it would’ve felt really weird for the characters to go back to being goofy-fun-times after what was essentially a massacre. However, I do think Taguchi took the cutting a bit far to the point where some really important lines and context which are relevant to the story, and explaining certain events were cut. Some of these cuts were instead written in mid-episode cards to explain things like world-building and character abilities. However, I can’t read Japanese, nor were they translated on Hulu (for me at least) and I haven’t watched the dub so I don’t know if they’re translated for that version which means that anime-only viewers and those who can’t read Japanese are excluded. It also just feels really weird not to have certain characters explain certain things like the rules of broken Bankai to someone like Ichigo because it assumes he knows that bit of important detail when he doesn’t. Also, episode 10 is structured and edited strangely and it’s the only episode I thought was off despite its content. Bleach never died, but boy is it back. I’m so happy with TYBW that I genuinely want the whole of the Bleach anime remade with Taguchi at the helm. No Filler, all bread-girl. I know that is incredibly greedy and entitled for me to want, but Bleach was my gateway into anime. It was the first (proper) anime I’d ever watched as a teen and it completely changed my view of what cartoons could be at the time. “What the fuck is an Ichigo?” I asked myself at 14. What the fuck indeed. And now here we are, 2022(3). The Bleach fans won in the end. We got what we deserved. A fucking incredible anime adaptation. I’m so happy about its success and I can’t wait for Coeur 2 in July.

"Bleach is back! More than a decade after the well-liked long-running series ended without the final arc from the source material, Bleach has come back with the final arc from the manga: The Thousand-Year Blood War Arc. I'll assume you've seen the original for the purposes of this review - though notably, knowledge of the filler arcs are not necessary. Story: Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War takes place right after the events where we left off in, from the original anime. We are very quickly tossed into the main story line - where we see the Quincys, long to be thought of as mostly gone, make a return to the Soul Society where they declare war. So why? We've had minor story snippets in the past, mostly through Uryuu, about why the Soul Reapers and Quincys were at odds, but nothing ever that made us think the very final arc would bring about this kind of chaos. But now the Quincys are back, and have brought nothing short of an army that seeks to kill every single Soul Reaper in the Soul Society - and in existance. The story in itself isn't anything we haven't seen before, but Bleach manages to show what happens when an entire line of beings - ie: Soul Reapers - start to get desperate. The troops that the Quincy army bring to the field, known as the Sternritter, are no pushovers either. We see many of them go toe-to-toe with some of the best within the Soul Society. We even see snippets of power from their leader, Yhwach (curiously pronounced as ""Yu-Ha-Bach""). This is no small war, and Bleach seeks to show us every little bit of it, including losses that are only starting. There are some episodes that give us small breaks from the grand war scene, and while they don't feature big fights, they do, however, show us important plot points that have resulted from the chaos that we already saw. What goes on with Ichigo, are parts of his background linked back to this war, how does Uryuu react to this war that's going on? These are all questions that are touched on - and don't forget, this is only part one out of part (at least rumoured) four. We're only getting started. (10/10) Characters: New characters to our story obviously put the spotlight on the Quincy leader, Yhwach. He is absolutely ruthless and shows no mercy in seeking his goal out - be it against his foes, or his own army. We also get to see small parts of his past, specifically with how it pertains to the Soul Reapers too, so this isn't just some random being that came into power either. He is to be feared and is the endgame. Most of his Sternritter with special letters assigned to them associate to a power they have (Ex: Bazz-B is allocated B, for Bang, because he can shoot gigantic fire bullets). Disney+, disappointingly, didn't subtitle any of these, and that's a layer I wish we were shown on screen by them. This obviously means they're stronger than your garden variety soldier. We get a chance to see the personalities on some of them, which was neat, though I expect we'll see more as the series carries on. Ichigo and company are all back and have basically not changed from where we left them. Orihime, Chad and Rukia don't have a ton of screen time, though I expect that to change in future parts. I'm happy to see that the captains get their shine here, as many are tasked with fighting an important member of the Sternritter, or going through some other massive change. This is the most they've been involved in quite some time. The other new characters worth mentioning are the Soul Society's Team 0, which are get involved in the back half of the series. They're a fun, fun group and are definitely more than they appear. Again, I hope they get more involved in the story as this carries on, but I like what I see so far. (9/10) Art: I was very worried when Pierrot was announced as the returning studio handling this series, because of their track record with Naruto - in making fights needlessly long and poorly animation. No such problems here. This was very well animation which maintained consistent throughout the entirety of the season. (10/10) Sound: Bleach returns with most of the OST, or some form of it, from the previous incarnation, which remains strong. I wasn't necessarily attached to either the OP or ED, but they were solid. Most of the VOs return, surprisingly, with only sixteen Bleach characters having their voices changed. Most of them are for fairly minor roles with notable ones being Chad (now Alain Mesa, replacing Jamieson Price because he no longer voices characters of colour) and anyone voiced by the Critical Role crew. The ones replacing them, however, are no slouches, as they're basically as good as the VOs that came before them. Notable additions to this season's cast, most of which voice multiple characters, include Robbie Daymond, Xander Mobus, Todd Haberkorn, Cherami Leigh, Jeannie Tirado and Aleks Le. This is a talented cast and I'm happy to see that a lot of the VOs who basically don't do a ton of VO work anymore, returned. (10/10) Overall: Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is amazing and should be on everyone's radar who were even small fans of Bleach, back when it originally aired. Disney+ did a huge disservice to the fans by not posting their English dub episodes in line with Hulu's. I'm not terribly surprised considering what they did with Summertime Rendering, but I can only hope they shape it up for when the next season rolls around. Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War is brutal and amazing, both at the same time, very worthy of the 10/10 that I'm so hesitant to give anime these days.

"10/10 gorgeous animation and art style. Best arc in Bleach finally animated and has been done justice by the adaptation, including some extensions to certain scenes. A few scenes cut to fit the darker tone of this arc which is fitting. Perfect set up for the rest of the story. The first episode is more of a showcase for fans of the OG series to appreciate the characters and their strength, which was very welcome after such a long time out of the spotlight. Shiro Sagisu has once again composed a flawless soundtrack including reworks of classics from the original series. Fans of other shounen will almost definitely appreciate and enjoy the new season due to it's fantastic visual style, the Quincies feel like threatening villains and the tease of Aizen's return will keep viewers hooked. 10/10",10,Recommended,"Dec 20, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_381018d200,11,800
"I cannot believe after all these years Bleach returned! They say when an anime is mostly carried by the visuals, that is a bad thing. Not so here say I, not a naysayer but a humble watcher of this masterpiece. They've has done it again, and has presented us with something beautiful. I thought the other seasons were good, but compared to this, well... Let's just say this make the Soul Vampires look like kids stuff. The story is basic but a gcongreattinuation, and is mostly irrelevant to the legendary fights being performed. The characters are amazing as always. The new Villian is amazing and maybe close to Aizen. A wonder to behold, this enrapturement, is a cacophony of color and sound. This deserves all the praises it gets plus more. I recommend watching it with friends and family because it only heightens the experience.

This show is so overrated. Watched it and it was ok but like the reviews here are all like 10/10? Feels like just the same formula of any shounen with a new big baddy thats stronger than all the old big baddies and then ass pull powerup for the MC. There isn't even a conclusion yet and this whole series revolved around rewriting over old backstory in the most uninspired way possible to give more chosen one vibe to the MC. Even 13 episodes felt like a lot since you can guess what was going to happen half way through and the second half was slow AF exposition broken up by shitty comedy elements that don't mix at all with the serious nature of what was at stake. Overall enjoyment is quite low for this. It was OK. 6/10,6,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 16, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_1f3db74a17,11,724
"No matter how you slice it, bleach sennen kessen-hen is top class and there is no, i said NO argument against it. What are the weaknesses and downsides you may ask? well you need to know bleach to get it's full effect. That can come in any form, whether you have watched all 300+ episodes of the anime or read the manga. Obviously watching TYBW without knowing the full story prior, (aizen+fullbringer arc) then you won't get it's full effect. It's been a while since I read the manga but if you want to get caught up on it prior to TYBW, the final arc, before you watch the anime, then I would 100% recommend reading it to give yourself a chance to experience the anime. It is understandable if someone does not want to read all 74 volumes or watch 300+ episodes to get caught up for a 13 season show. The rating of the show should not suffer because of that though. Bleach is returning over a decade later, and only a select number of people who have consumed bleach are likely the only ones watching TYBW. After all, it wouldn't make any sense to watch something you have no idea about and rate it 1/10 right guys (wink wink)? If you know bleach, then there is absolutely zero excuse not to watch. The number one crtique among those who know bleach is pacing, and I somewhat agree. I think that certain plot points are rushed but instead of getting into the minute details, I applaud it's fast pacing. It makes the season action-packed and extremely entertaining with no boring filler or flashbacks (the important flashbacks were there obviously). Everything is done amazingly including animation which pierrot outdone themselves after the travesty of naruto shippuden and boruto. The final critique is soundtrack and I agree. The music isn't great and neither is the timing, but it wasn't AWFUL. It's average at best, probably below-average but does not takeaway from the brilliance of Bleach Thousand Year Blood-War Arc. If you know Bleach, you need to watch. Whether you want to do the work of getting caught up through the manga or anime if you haven't already is up to you. 9/10",9,Mixed Feelings,"Jun 9, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_03a94c7f16,11,2086
"Rushed and Underwhelming: A Tale of Missed Marks and Lost Essence Oh boy, where do I even begin with Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War? As a long-time fan of the franchise, I had high hopes for this final arc adaptation. But sadly, it fell far short of my expectations and left me feeling disappointed. I'm here to share my honest thoughts on this particular installment of the series, and why it failed to live up to its potential. First and foremost, the animation quality in Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War was a major letdown. The art seemed rushed and lacked the attention to detail that fans have come to expect from the beloved Bleach universe. The character designs felt flat and lacked the depth they once had. The fight scenes, which were supposed to be the highlight of this arc, were lackluster and lacked the intensity and fluidity that made the earlier seasons so captivating. It's such a shame because the source material deserved better treatment. Another major issue is pacing. The story was crammed into just a handful of episodes, resulting in a rushed and disjointed narrative. In the source material, the Thousand-Year Blood War arc spanned several volumes and was packed with intricate plot twists, character development, and epic battles. However, this adaptation failed to capture the essence of the original material, opting for a condensed version that robbed the story of its depth and complexity. Important character moments were overlooked, leaving viewers disconnected from the emotional impact that was supposed to be felt. Moreover, the lack of character development was a huge letdown. In previous seasons, Bleach excelled at creating compelling and multifaceted characters. However, in the Thousand-Year Blood War adaptation, characters were merely reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes, devoid of the growth and depth that they had previously exhibited. This lack of investment in character development made it difficult to connect with the cast on an emotional level, ultimately leaving the audience unfulfilled. The OST (original soundtrack) is another aspect that deserves criticism. The music, which was once a staple of the series and contributed significantly to the atmosphere, felt uninspired and repetitive. The absence of impactful and memorable tracks only added to the lackluster experience of watching this adaptation. Lastly, the ending of Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War fell flat. Without giving away any spoilers, it concluded in a rushed and unsatisfactory manner, leaving many loose ends and unanswered questions. It felt as if the creators were merely trying to tie up loose ends as quickly as possible, without giving proper closure to the storylines and character arcs that fans had invested in over the years. To sum it up, Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War fell short in multiple areas. With subpar animation, rushed pacing, lack of character development, uninspiring music, and a dissatisfying conclusion, it's clear that this adaptation did not do justice to the source material. As a long-time fan, it pains me to give this series a 3/10 rating. However, it's important to critically assess even the things we love and acknowledge their flaws. Hopefully, in the future, Bleach will receive the adaptation it truly deserves, one that faithfully captures the essence of the amazing world created by Tite Kubo.",3,Recommended,"Aug 2, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_d50847ced6,11,3366
"Hiya! My name is Anime Logician, and I'm an Anime YouTuber. I've watched anime since I was at the age of eight, and I'm still managing to this day! With over 400+ anime titles viewed, I decided to share my knowledge and wisdom with the anime community. With my experience with anime, I am reviewing anime for the community and my enjoyment. Now then, let's get started with the review. PLOT: Bleach, The Thousand Year Blood War is an arc full of surprises and great points within the story. A thousand years have passed since the war between the original 13 captains and the quincies. It seems Ichigo Kurosaki isn't entirely done with his soul reaper duties, and so begins a new showdown as Ywacch and his new and improved quincy army are back for revenge and are wanting to demolish the Soul society and bring an end to the thirteen court guard squads, but just how will this end exactly? I'm eleven episodes into the anime, and already my expectations have been met. Back when Bleach ended on that sorry excuse of an arc, I had been wondering will Bleach ever return to its glory days or will it forever be overshadowed by its terrible filler arcs and lack of character development. Still, as I said before, my expectations were met, and am glad Bleach is back and this time even better than before! PLOT RATING: 10/10 CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Character development is another redeemable quality to this anime, as we are finally getting to some of the more unknown parts of the characters! Rukia, Ichigo, Renji, and much much more!! More bankais are awakened, New captains are chosen, and Lots of character development is taken place within each episode. I am excited about the new episodes and look forward to completing my Bleach DVD collection soon!! CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT RATING: 10/10 ANIMATION: What can I say about the animation? Well, it's new and improved; it seems to be more crystal clear and more persistent, like watching an episode of Demonslayer or Jujutsu Kaisen, it wasn't the same Bleach I had watched 10 years ago, but it was a new and improved anime, which is why the animation is perfect to me. ANIMATION RATING: 10/10 INTRO/OUTRO: The intro and outro are great compared to the past intros/outros, and when it comes to the intros and outros I've never once waivered when it came down to loving them. ""SCAR"" by Tatsuya Kitani is what I would call a great Intro, my only complaint is that the track itself could have been a bit more electrifying and hyped. Regardless it is what it is, and I'm in agreement that the track does the anime justice. ""Saihate"" by SennaRin is perfect and in my opinion the better of the two tracks! How can I describe this track? Electronic pop music followed by beautiful and melodic vocals. The track itself is perfect and unforgettable. INTRO: 4/5 OUTRO: 5/5 INTRO/OUTRO: 9/10 PERSONAL OPINION: It's been over 10 years basically past a decade and it's finally here, the new Bleach: Thousand Year Blood War Arc and I'm here for it! Being the OG fan that I am I decided to add this anime to my collection and this anime will be complete once I am done with my anime collection. Honestly I disliked how Bleach had ended years ago and ending on a bad note should never be something an anime does, but with the TYBW arc being animated I now have faith that Bleach will be considered one of the best anime to ever exist and it'll be up there with FMAB and One Piece. I've been wanting to say this for years and now I can..... I AM GLAD TO BE A BLEACH FAN!!!!! FINAL VERDICT: 9/10 - AMAZING Bleach is an anime which has had it's Ups and Downs, but unlike some anime, Bleach has made a remarkable comeback and the community is hyped for this anime to be back. Let's hope it stays that way.

"I am so very happy with this Anime i could grin from ear to ear. The original Bleach whilst not terrible was far to slow. The fights took a decade to complete and they didn't feel satisfying as they didn't feel like they had any consequences. I feel this made the original quite the slog to get through. Especially someone who watched bleach for the first time only a few years ago. Maybe it's simply due to it aging poorly however this improved upon the original in every way imaginable. The fights in this Anime look great in terms of animation quality and i also believe they're far more interesting as a result of a faster pace. This Season perfectly shows how you can tell a big story in a faster pace as the original. The original (if it told the same story) would have dragged and probably made these thirteen episodes last fifty or possibly sixty episodes. I'm so happy with this more modern approach to the Anime. I have also failed to yet mention how there are real consequences felt within this season. Now i will not spoilt anything, but if you have seen the original i believe this will make you so happy. The only part that the original does almost as well i believe is the story. However this season handles it better with a quicker pace. The issue in the original was it was far too dragged out. I must also mention how the villains feel great and their threat feels real. I am also shocked at how graphic it can be. Now it isn't anything i would consider truly Gorey. That being said it doesn't need to be. This season perfectly shows the brutal nature of attacks with a fair amount of blood and body parts being dismembered. If you are reading this and haven't seen the Anime please do not watch this if my words have made you believe it is extremely gory as it is not. But compared to the original i have far more interest in the effects of attacks and the consequences of their outcomes. The gore i also believe is perfect how it is this season. There is no need for it to get more adult at all. I'm very impressed with the team behind this revival of Bleach. Overall i think this is definitely a recommendation from me. That being said you of course should know the story of the original before coming to this which is a sad requirement to truly get the most out of this Anime i believe. 8/10 - HotHamlet",8,Recommended,"May 10, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_67681318a3,11,2325
"It's good to see that this series can still give me hope after such a lackluster finish to the manga. Needless to say, this cour looked exceptionally good, all things considered. If we're talking about individual episodes, it could even stand up among the best of the season and even the whole year. However, we're talking about the whole product, and I'm already seeing some of the cracks in the narrative. The gorgeous animation makes them harder to see in some ways, and I suspect that this series will live or die based on how it executes the big fights that are coming down the pike (I think it got rather messy during those), but I can't set those aside, particularly the retcons that are meant to cover for plot holes in the original run. I don't want to be too harsh on a cour that I still think stands among the better runs of anime this year, even if the pacing feels a bit rushed in places and a bit too slow in others.",8,Recommended,"Jun 24, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_6bdc4c530f,11,930

"Brief overview: MUST-WATCH, Bleach last Arc that is a war set between the Soul reaper and a mysterious unknown enemy This review will be based on part 1 and 2 of TYBW. To prevent spoilers most content will be shortened Story 9/10 I know it's a crime to not give this a 10/10, but hear me out. The story sets straight after the fullbringer arc where Ichigo and others have their power back. However, the soul reapers were only expecting peace and dealing with the everyday hollows until one day they met a mysterious enemy that had taken advantage of them and killed many of its comrades. Therefore, the soul reaper was severely unstrengthened and unprepared for the upcoming war. This left the soul society at risk of being overthrown and taken by that mysterious enemy. The story is great, it shows the seriousness of the situation and the current issue with the soul reapers who haven't fully mastered their powers and were rushed to train and gain those powers within a short time. However, this is the biggest problem with the story is the pacing. The pacing of the story is so fast towards the point that it needs to be watched at least two times to not miss out on all the content as it can easily be left out if you do not pay enough attention, but it does show all the major part well enough. Characters 8/10 (Minor spoilers) Bleach has this strange way of handling their characters where they are shown in a few episodes and throughout the rest of the series are basically never shown again. As of now is still too early to judge, but the characters are great. It shows every character's major powers and abilities throughout the Arc, but here's the problem that has occurred in the old Bleach and probably now as well. This is where the quantity amount of scenes/episodes of the characters showing their abilities are shown in a very small amount of scenes and throughout the rest of the series, and it is never shown again. I give you an example of One piece Marine ford arc. When we first witness Akainu's power it is not only shown in just one episode, but throughout many episodes and fights with different characters during the Marine ford arc by prolonging it. However, Bleach only showed its character's power in only a few episodes/scenes and it didn't give a satisfactory amount of content from those characters as the content shown is so short and some didn't describe what their ability or figure out what their ability are. (SPOILER) There is also some missed opportunities for the characters that should've included a backstory which is the bambies. The bambies are one of the most noticeable groups throughout the Quincies and are barely shown any backstory or abilities during their fight with Ichigo which is quite a letdown. Animation 10/10 The animation is the greatest animation that Bleach has to offer. Out of the big three Bleach has the most quantity of quality animation and after the long hiatus of Bleach it does show that the animators put a lot of love and efforts into the animation. They are probably fans of the series like us. TLDR This is a massive step for Bleach. The story included a lot of seriousness and struggle to fight the new unknown enemy. The characters are great, but some of the most noticeable didn't have enough screen time which is let down and the animation is movie quality level which is great.",10,Recommended,"Sep 2, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_f9f74da7ce,11,3357
"It's good to see that the Bleach anime is back to adapt the Thousand Year Blood War arc. After I finish every episode, I re-read the manga to know which chapters it adapted, to find out what details from the manga got omitted in the anime, and to see what new scenes the anime adaptation got over the manga. Manga content that weren't adapted into the anime were either brief dialogue, some comedy scenes, and some tidbits of info that could have supplemented a fact or explanation. Speaking of the new scenes in the anime adaptation, remember Ichigo using Bankai to dispatch some normal Hollows in the first episode? Yes, it's one of those new scenes and a good example of a fanservice that I think were primarily meant for long time fans who finally get to watch a brand new episode of Bleach after the more or less 10 year long wait. The fanservice that really stayed on me was the usage of Rapport by Kitani Tatsuya which was featured in Bleach EX last year in the first episode's ED with the visuals showing important scenes from the previous Bleach anime, mosty Ichigo's journey from meeting Rukia up to the Fullbring arc, basically a recap of the 366 episodes of Bleach minus the fillers. Another fanservice that took me by surprise was the showcasing of the original Gotei 13 captains. In the manga we only got silhouettes, with Yamamoto and Unohana the obvious ones but in the anime adaptation we finally get to see what they all look like. On the music/sound side, there were some new OSTs but majority of them were remixes of OSTs from the previous Bleach anime, and I expect it to be the case for the other soundtracks that we will hear from the future episodes yet to come. The OP and ED were good, most notably the ED (because of Hiroyuki Sawano). Looking forward for the next batch of OPs and EDs. On the art and animation side most were done well, especially during the big fights, most notably Ichigo vs the main villain. It was nice to see that the anime prolonged the fight between Ichigo and the antagonist and had a good amount of sakuga. The 3d animation on the Hollows in the first episode looked ok, in contrast to the 3d animation applied on one part of Yamamoto's Bankai which looked weird. There was also that pink aesthetic in the OP and flashback scenes from the previous Bleach anime on every episode which I think was unnecessary but I guess it's still ok.

"NUMBER ONE ON TOP ANIME??? Wow, I can't believe this series is back though I just watched 12 episodes of it. The animation is fun. I like how the studio did things like show the volume and weight of hair and clothing. Something that I don't think was highlighted much when the series last aired. Sometimes the story jumps a little too far ahead and then I get lost, but otherwise it's fun to watch. This series is a lot more gory than ever before (I know it's called the thousand year BLOOD war, but really, it's very gory) so that surprised me.

"As someone whos been a huge Bleach fan since the Arcancars, the newest series is both amazing to behold continue and yet, sad to see Bleach at only a fraction of what it once was. If you watch this, never seeing Bleach series, then you're obviously not going to keep up with this new arc. I seriously don't know why Bleach doesn't get enough love, but its an amazing series with some of the best fight animations ever. That's most in part to the insane creator and his team of launching crazy characters, abilities, and a surreal lore of supernatural magic. This latest series, although looking more cinematic, suffers from not delivering an expected intro banger, ESPECIALLY FOR BEING A MAIN STORY. Like the intro is something better fit for something in a filler. But anyways. The 1000 year blood arc is seriously an insane story if you've already read the Manga. Sadly, the animation REALLY missed out on their own gold mine. 1000 year blood arc is a story as good as the original Hollow arc, and yet, the show itself just feels like its made to be made. Just expose the story, puts some nice scenes, and move on. Where as previous series had better character development and intensity to its plot events, this new series really missed its mark. Like the first episode could have been done so much better when the war began as mentioned in its anime description, but the ANIME decided to rush the story pace just like the manga! The manga can get away with bullet point events, but c'mon, the anime is where the manga can be improved, extended, and refined. I was seriously disappointed about the pace. Overall, awesome 13 episodes reflecting the first introduction to the war. I know it wasn't easy to start off with such intense fight scenes, but they at least managed that. The art, 100/10 can't even complain. But the production as a whole feels lackluster.

"The color design is so dogshit. The attempts to make the lighting and coloring realistic may work on other shows but in Bleach it doesn't. The old charm and colorful vibrant design of Bleach is lost and so is the style. The style was the strong point of Bleach and if that is lost then people will just see it as a generic shonen which it is currently. The color design in the 2021 reveal trailer was perfect. Too bad they changed it to something so dogshit. Also, the writing is abhorrent. They promised to add more things but the added content (which is barely anything) is worthless if you add 1 thing and remove 50 important things. They should re-hire the old Bleach script writers like Mr. Masahiro Okubo. Why are they working on Boruto? No one watches that. Call them back and get them to work on Bleach. Bring back the omake segments like Quincy Encyclopedia, Shinigami Zukan etc. Stuffing 5 chapters/episode and rushing through so much. I could tolerate the horrendous color designs but the writing makes this show unwatchable when you see scene after scene after scene, 400 lines of dialogue per episode, randomly placed ED, 3 min recaps (ep. 4), long post-credits sequences etc. Whoever is currently writing this is not a good writer. The only positives of this cour were some backgrounds in episode 1 and 13 and the new orchestral OST from Mr. Shiro Sagisu. I thought this would be the definitive way to experience TYBW arc and I thought it would be like Hunter x Hunter 2011 with 100+ episodes and a well paced series but this is so off the mark.",5,Not Recommended,"Jan 12, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_12bc3e9fa8,12,1559
"Holy peak, Batman! This season covering the “Thousand Year Blood War” arc is “Bleach” operating at its highest level (or rather, highest spiritual pressure). The animation and music is flawless. The action contained within episodes 1-7 is arguably the most thrilling and devastating that the anime has featured thus far. And even when it shifts its focus more towards story rather than fights after the mid-season finale, it graces these stories—both present time and flashbacks—with roughly half a dozen insane lore drops that might leave your jaw on the floor. This 2022 season of “TYBW” is undoubtably the best arc of the anime since its earlier hitter “Soul Society.” While later arcs also had great moments, much of them suffered from egregiously slow pacing. “TYBW” passed the test of overcoming this flaw with flying colors; and this is coming from someone who watched the last 1/3 or so of the original series at 2x speed. Now I have returned to both watching at 1x speed and actively looking forward for what comes next.

It should've been 24 episodes season, but they compressed it into 13 episodes cour. Little time is given to other characters like Inoue, Kon, Urahara. Also, we see the backstory of Ichigo's parents and Ishida's parents.

Also another thing I like naruto as a series more I think its story characters world and action is better, but I think this season of bleach is better than shippuden.

"Bleach: Sennen Kessen-hen After the first 3 episodes had actually impressed me and I immediately had to write a ""positive"" review about it, the remaining 9 episodes made me do the opposite. There was much talk about the anime fixing many of the manga's problems with changes and improvements. I'm still waiting for that. The intro of this season was decent, it built up suspense and curiosity and the studio did a good job of pacing. Unfortunately, everything changed with the beginning of the invasion of the Soul Society. From then on it was just a mediocre spectacle. The Quincy invasion was a complete mindless act of mercy. It was meant to show how dangerous and deadly these enemies are, yet they failed to kill a captain even though they had every chance to do so. Especially with some strong Sternritters present like Bazz-B who could have wiped out half of Gotei 13 while not possessing any Bankai. Instead he did nothing because it would be stupid if the main characters died. And the only one who had an oversized deathflag (Byakuya) just survived? They spent half an episode making it look like a Death, only for an Unnamed NPC to come along and say ""Don't worry he's alive lol :3"" The fights between the Captains and Sternritters felt so forced and weird, a questionable mix of too rushed and yet too little screentime. You could have made every one of these fights almost off-screen and nothing would have changed in the course of the season, except that the pacing would probably be improved. Because Gotei 13 is only made up of weenies, they just waited for Kurosaki-kun for the next 2 episodes. And that was really it, these 3-4 episodes had absolutely nothing, they were soulless and empty. After the final conflict between the two leaders began, you might have thought that the interesting part was about to begin. In the end, Yamamoto only fought with a cosplayer and lost as usual. Yamamoto is a character with so much hype who is only there to make bad and wrong decisions. And after the end of the arc, Yhwach of all people had to tell us the Yamamoto lore and why the fight ended the way it did. There is no worse writing than using the enemies as a narrator to explain something. Well that ended the bad part of the season. From then on there was the Zaraki training arc? If you can call it that, which was relatively surprising and interesting. Also the backstory of Ichigo's parents, which was practically the most interesting part of this season. This part gave the story much more depth and tied up some loose ends. It also successfully promoted the ""Aizen Partner Finding Service"". [Conclusion 6] I was really looking forward to the new Bleach season because I had forgotten what Bleach was like over the years. This season helped me remember that Bleach is really just a big pot of shounen cliches and fan service adorned with epic music and cool fights. I'm happy with what I got, but on average it was a pretty meager result. My hope lives on that the upcoming seasons will be able to make up for the horror of the manga.

"Bleach has always been one of my favorites. It was such a treat to watch the anime finally adapt the story closer to the manga while also correcting some pacing problems and fleshing a few things out further. From the moment this cour started, I was swept back up into the universe so easily and I wasn't disappointed with what the anime offered this time. That said, I won't truly know how I feel about this final act of Bleach's anime until we reach the end of it and see if they add things and overcome the damaage the drama with Shueisha did to the manga back in the day. That said, I'm glad it came back. I loved the use of color to accentuate emotion especially the emotions swirling inside Ichigo. I can't wait for the next part. If you grew up with Bleach, this is definitely an anime you will wnt to check out. If you didn't and you're interested in the serries, I would recommend, if you choose to watch the anime instead of read the manga be aware some things will shift in this arc as the characterizations and stakes align more closely with the manga.",8,Recommended,"Dec 27, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_318ce5b402,12,1064
"Coming back to anime after nearly half a decade, I've been excited to catch up. All that time has allowed quality shows to pile up, and near the top of my to-watch list was the supposedly-astounding adaptation of Bleach's Thousand-Year Blood War Arc. I was a massive Bleach fan when I was a teenager. I read the manga all through Soul Society, and I followed the story as the Arancar arc came out, bit by bit. However, by the time Aizen had been sealed up, so had my enthusiasm. After a fascinating start, Bleach had steadily devolved into a smoosh of power-level nonsense, deus-ex power-ups, and no meaningful thematic throughlines. However, what offended me more than all of that, was Bleach's sheer level of predictability. See, I'm actually a big battle shonen fan, and I can forgive most flaws in a good one as long as it doesn't commit the crime of being boring. Bleach, though? Bleach got boring. Every relevant plot point was resolved by a fight. The fight was decided before the outcome based on the direction the story was headed and how important the characters were. The importance of the fight determined how many back-and-forth twists occurred before the inevitable end of the fight. The world of Bleach: its politics, quirks, hierarchies, and more, were all completely irrelevant, and it wasn't worth investing in them because at the end of the day the solution to every major problem boiled down to 'how hard can these guys swing these swords,' with Ichigo's sword being the swingiest and most big. Whenever there was a new power to be had, Ichigo would get it, assembling a collection of unbeatable powers in the dullest way possible: he is fast and can swing big sword strong. Ya kidding? That's it The only exception is Urahara, who actually had PLANS that DID things to affect the story. But he wasn't around much. Enter Blood War. I was stoked. No, really. My impression was that this was the arc when Bleach got back on track, its Chimera Ant-style magnum opus which focused on more than just 'how big and strong is Ichigo's sword' and instead developed the bloody and sordid history of Soul Society and all of the generational violence and hatred between the Soul Reapers and the Quincies in a way that was interesting and thought-provoking. There's so much you can do with a story like this! How did these layers of resentment get written into both sides? How does this conflict test the loyalties of those who straddle the line? Maybe the conflict isn't 'the world is ending' this time, but is instead about how to put an end to a millennium of mutual bloodshed? Maybe Ichigo can take a more interesting role: not that of 'big sword swing guy' but instead of diplomat, leaning into Ichigo's character strength of rejecting revenge and anger as motivators and pursuing truth. Maybe we can get more about the captains, and juxtapose them against their predecessors to show how they both still embody the ruthless ideals of the first Gotei 13 while also showing how much of their bloodlust they've actually lost over the years. Maybe we can get more about Quincy society in a nuanced way, and showcase the ways in which it is both superior and inferior to the soul reaper world. Maybe we can have an antagonist who is as sympathetic as they are terrifying. Maybe... Maybe we can scrap all of that, and do the same shit all over again. Gah, what a disappointment. The adaptation is beautiful, no doubt, and the quality is super high, but the story is just so freaking boring. Any pretense of nuance is quickly dropped: the Quincy King is just a total piece of shit who everyone hates, the soul reapers are the good guys who had no choice but to stop the crazed Quincy actions, and we quickly find ourselves in the same position as always. There's a super strong guy who needs to be beaten by a guy with a big sword, so Ichigo sets off to go get new better stronger powers while we fill the time until the inevitable sword-swinging showdown with lots of side fights with all the captains and lieutenants and such. Most of the new antagonists are just one-note bit characters with nothing to offer. Most are also raging psychopaths to give the conflicts zero nuance. Any Quincies that are likeable switch sides and join the soul reapers, so that we don't have any interesting conflicts. Long gone are the days of Ichigo versus Zaraki, where both sides were likeable. Now it's just 'what total piece of shit is Renji going to fuck up so that he can look cool?' It's dull, it's repetitive, and I'm over it. If you liked the Arancar arc, you'll like this one. It's probably a bit better at doing what that arc did. There are a sprinkling of character backstory episodes given throughout, and some of them are kind of interesting. However, if you were like me and that arc's monotony burned you out, I am sorry to say that we are not in uncharted territory. Blood War hasn't finished airing yet, but in 39 episodes it has done nothing to surprise or interest me. Instead, it has done its best to steadily remove every intriguing element so that we can eventually reach our final line-up of important fights between the 'good guys' and the 'crazy genocidal freaks.' Some Blood War. It's just 'let's stop Hitler' written from the Allies' perspective, except Ichigo's repertoire of moves are somehow more dull than trench warfare.",3,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 15, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_0f29246b72,12,5342
"Review Date: 21/4/2025 Rewatching this series made me truly appreciate how awesome the Bleach series has become. It's been over a decade since Bleach finally decided to follow-up the last arc they did, the Fullbringer arc. While me reading the entire manga adaptation of this arc fully spoiled me of this, the anime adaptation definitely went above and beyond here. What the manga adaptation certainly didn't have was the emotion and hype. The anime adaptation damn near provided this in its best way with the camera cuts, impressive animation and even additional frames. While the dialogue mostly stayed true to the source material, I found it unique how the battle scenes were as special as it was depicted. The current style trumps whatever the style Bleach was using in the 2000s or even the 2010s. Tite Kubo, the creator, has created the best anime of 2022 easily and this was a sequel. A sequel to a somewhat disappointing arc to most (I found it to be good enough). Obviously I already know what will happen but I'm expecting this anime to reach even greater highest in the second part of the arc which funnily enough I haven't even watched. Overall, banger arc to an already classic Shounen anime.",10,Recommended,"Apr 20, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_b7efdffd6f,12,1205
"The anime took an entirely different approach from Bleach and hence felt like something entirely new. The writing improved drastically and the plot never felt dragged out. The writers always knew what to do and always took risks and extreme turns in many points in the story for the sake of entertainment and development. During the whole time I was sitting at the edge of my seat, and as a viewer, I generally felt a lot more appreciated by this than I ever felt by Bleach during my initial viewing of it. The story also covers a lot of things that in the initial anime (most likely intentionally) were left unanswered, and sometimes even unasked. Without this, I feel a lot of us would be left confused on many aspects of Bleach. A lot of new things are introduced, but just in the right way for us to understand it all without being overwhelmed.",7,Recommended,"Jul 27, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 1,41467,bleach_tybw_part_1_7eb4cf1307,12,848

A primarily fight based anime with mediocre story at best can't be GREAT unless there's a great freaking Villain to duo with the Hero. Ichigo does his job very very well, but the bland generic villain with generic plot just makes it above average anime with great fight sequence at best. Also the feelings are kinda forced down your throat, not exactly organic. The comedy feels generic as well. So there's that. It's Bleach, so you knew what you are getting into.

It felt like an ending that respected its own storytelling and world, without needless plot twists every single moment. That's when I guess Kubo was pressed to keep on writing, and it shows. I didn't like the Fullbring arc, and I also didn't enjoy what I read of this arc. Every new plot thread was almost completely unforeshadowed, right out of nowhere, and it feels like the series is making fun of its own world that had been so interestingly set up in the beginning (especially the Zero Division, I really hate that they're such one-note characters and so extremely and unnecessarily wacky). Nevertheless, this season was a treat to watch as a Bleach fan. From the animation, to the remixed OST, the opening and the ending, everything feels like so much care and attention was taken to make this. This was made by Bleach fans, for Bleach fans.

I was one of those many Years ago, who continually searched the Internet, asking, Is Bleach returning?? I listened to various Conspiracies as why it was and why it wasn't, that was before i joined MAL. Well here is why i'm not as pleased as i thought i would be. What i did not like. The horrible Greyish dark color scheme they have used throughout. Imagine looking out your window at twilight, you can see things, but it's not very clear. That is today's Bleach. The Character designs, everyone seems to be least a foot taller, especially Ichigo & Kenpachi. they all look stretched out and pointy. The sometimes still pictures used instead of animating, they must have spent a fortune on production costs, so Why?? I could go on but this is what has stuck with me since finishing weeks ago. So what did i like?? Seeing all the characters again after so long. That this is beginning of the end of the storyline. I am actually a fan of Bleach, having watched the whole original series many times, even really liking the Zanpakuto Rebellion Arc, but not the horrible Fullbring Arc. After waiting so long and being slightly disappointed, i stopped watching weekly and finished the last 4 episodes in one go. There is no way this is a top 10 rating, i think everyone's anticipation got the better of them and they rated it so high because of this.

More story, better looking fights, OP bankais finally being shown off that everyone has been waiting for. So why did I select mixed feelings? There's actually one thing that's different. Bleach has always stretched the content out longer than it needs to be (like most shounen do), but it's always been enjoyable. But this time, the content has been rushed. Hard. This easily could have been 20 episodes and it would've been better for it. There wasn't enough time to fully enjoy anything as it lasted a few minutes and then the next thing is thrown at you or the episode ends and the next episode starts off somewhere else. I could feel the time crunch multiple times throughout. There were multiple parts that could have been 1-2 whole episodes but instead were 3-5 minutes. I don't know if they locked in 13 episodes and couldn't change it later, or if they just decided that they were going to make it all fit no matter what, but it hurt the story. There's one word I'll hate to see being stomped into the dirt even more, the once bright, golden ""masterpiece,"" but this isn't a bad show either.

"Edit: TYBW started off weak and got significantly better. The last 6 episodes are especially good and surprisingly better than the Manga. Bleach should have ended with the defeat of Aizen. It was the perfect ending: Ichigo sacrificing his powers and losing his connection to the spiritual world in exchange for defeating the greatest evil. Instead what we got was the Fullbringer Arc that nobody wanted but got anyway; followed by the Thousand Year Blood War that everybody wanted but turned out dissapointing. The bad: 1. Everyone has already mentioned this but the pacing is terrible. Sometimes it moves too quick and you get a number of amazing scenes squished together, sometimes it moves at a snails pace with nothing important happening. 2. Why is every shot a close up? Everything is scene is up close to the characters and most of character interaction is either waist up or a head shot. The directing makes everything feels cramped and claustrophobic. 3. The dialogue can be really weird at times. ""Oh hey Inoue. I can see that Chad is also with you. Hey Chad?"" I keep thinking that this is not how people talk as I continue watching. 4. The classic shonen power scaling dilemma. When you have a villain as powerful as Aizen and your only way of one-upping that is by creating a stronger villain, you end up with a conflict that feels unrealistically one-sided. If the Gotei 13 could not defeat Aizen (just barely with Ichigo), what chance do they stand with Yhwach? The good: 1. The visuals are stunning every 4 episodes or so. 2. Amazing voice acting. 3. Fun reveal of everything Bleach like Yamamoto's and Kyoraku's Bankais. 4. The new story lines are very interesting such as squad zero and the soul king.

"This anime has a disastrous montage. Burn The Witch is anything but a movie. The biggest problem that prevents any internal logic is the way it was distributed by Crunchyroll. The movie was perforated like a seasonal anime, and the transition between the 3 episodes is disastrous, the narrative tone of each episode gives the feeling that the story is going to be much bigger than it really is. In the little show time we have, the anime tries to develop an internal problem that doesn't work or just doesn't matter, and tries to assimilate that with a drama of some characters that does not move. When I finished watching, it got that feeling of something unfinished. It can even be a very rich anime visually, but it does not explore any of this, the anime universe is very artificial, it seems that the characters were taken from another world, and played there in the middle. To conclude, Burn The Witch was not able to enchant at any time thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers who seem to me to have prioritized a visual part without correctly assimilating it as the work's unity.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_aaf851ef92,1,1087
"Well, this movie was nice to watch. It really brought back that Bleach nostalgia. While I can't even to begin to express how glad I am that I could experience Burn The Witch immediately as it released, it wasn't a flawless masterpiece. It tried to tell way too much story that could naturally fit in a one hour movie. The world building wasn’t as strong as it could have been. If only this movie had an extra 20-30 minutes to its runtime, like a normal length animated feature, it would have flowed a lot smoother and could have fleshed out the characters and world a bit more. Some things weren't explained fully and the characters didn't have enough time to become fully developed. This is especially true for Balgo, who is easily the flattest and least interesting character in the movie. There is a moment at the end of the movie where two characters hug (sort of), and it feels so random and comes so out of nowhere, that you would think that there actually was a prequel movie to this, since nothing in the movie made it seem like they were on hugging terms. Another flaw I would give this movie would go to the animation team at studio Colorido. While the fight scenes were well animated for the most part, a lot of the still frames felt stiff. While that may seem like an obvious thing to say, it felt stiffer than most still frames feel. Some of the CG was off-putting as well, but most of the CGI was integrated well. Now for the positives, as I said before, the action scenes were well animated for the most part. They were very slickly and stylishly animated and the CGI was integrated well most of the time. The Marchen (legendary dragon) was animated nicely as well. The entire backstory scene with Macy and Elly was presented wonderfully. The ED song was nice and the soundtrack fit. The voice cast was all solid as well. Most of the cast had great designs. The character designs were very Bleach-like and they looked great in this setting. Also, it is just nice to see the Bleach references and to just be back in the world of Bleach. The main characters, Noel and Ninny, are really likable (even if not fully developed), and they really had a natural and believable chemistry between them. This movie was enjoyable, although I went in to the movie already loving it, so I have a bias. That being said, I think that non-Bleach fans will have a harder time enjoying it than Bleach fans. There will probably be more animated Burn The Witch content down the road, so it will be interesting to see where the series goes from here.

"Burn the witch made me feel like I was watching the 6th episode (and only the 6th episode) in a 12 episode series. The first part of the anime jumps straight into action with minimal information. We get about 2 minutes of the anime establishing the setting, another 2 minutes of vague implications about who and what people are, and then all of a sudden we’re fighting dragons in the middle of the street. The lack in background isn’t so bad that you can’t follow what’s going on, but the anime would have been a million times better if everything had been laid out properly before the plot started escalating (which is how stories usually work). On a positive note, I thought the sounds were amazing. The greatest selling point of this anime would probably be the background music which fit the scenes very well. The music had a magical vibe that was perfect for the plot. It was also very innovative since it combined different kinds of sounds: modern sounds, orchestral sounds, and even some really cool vocals. I enjoyed the effects and outro too. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_881af0dfbb,1,1056
"Oh my, the time has finally come for Burn the Witch, a much-anticipated movie constantly advertised by your favorite streaming site: Crunchyroll. I can best describe this movie as average and enjoyable. In fact, I can't even call this a movie, maybe an OVA would better describe it. Let me start off with the first thing that greets you when you watch an anime, the animation. I must say Studio Colorido has done a great job at animating this movie, the fight scenes are visually pleasing and the movements are fluid, there's no sign of shoddy work done by a bunch of underpaid chumps. Although some frames felt a bit jagged and stiff, great work! I will also praise the character designs which fit perfectly into the setting. Now onto the story and let me say this again, it's nothing special. Just your average shounen anime, fights, drama, and bam that's that. Although they did a decent job explaining the backstories everything just felt a bit rushed, if this movie was maybe 30-50 minutes longer, they could've executed this a bit better. MC's are likable, nothing special, there's chemistry but at the same time it doesn't feel as fully built as it should be, the ending scene seemed completely out of place. Then there's Balgo, who is so damn bland, so boring that even some plain tart from Yogurtland had more ""spice."" I understand there wasn't much material to work with, but everything felt extremely rushed. In summation, Burn the Witch is an enjoyable movie, albeit with no depth in any way. Visually rich but falls short when you take the story into account. Nothing more than your average shounen anime as I previously stated. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 1, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_79c2b0ff16,1,1646
"Holy mother of kino. I completely expected a soulless cashgrabbing garbage to fund Bleach 2021, but I was absolutely surprised. Burn the Witch is the only anime I didn't drop at episode 1 in 2020, and not because other shows this year were absolutely horrible, they were, but Burn the Witch is so god damn good. Let's get this out of the way. I am a fan of Bleach, been one for some 12 years now. But these 3 episodes, or should I say, 1 movie, took me in way faster than anything Bleach EVER did. Interesting characters? Check. Amazing power system? Check. Amazing animation? Check. Bleach references? Check. Kubo once again showed why he is a master of character design, if not story telling at least. But BTW GENUINELY has a great premise. The series fully deserves to be completely adapted, and I can easily see it overcoming Bleach, in both quality and popularity. To keep this short, it's an amazing watch, doesn't even matter if you saw/read Bleach or not. This movie is absolute quality of the highest standard, and it is surprising it comes from a hack like Kubo, who butchered the ending of Bleach.

"What you need to know about this movie is that this is only season 1, which most people seem to not be aware of. There will be a season 2 for the manga which will more than likely be animated as well. On the production side, there is nothing to complain about. The animation is totally smooth and nowhere does it ever drop in quality. The ED theme is beautiful. The sound designer didn't do that annoying thing where they just added a ton of bass to every explosion/hit and crunched it. The comedy was on point, the character designs are all unique, the voices fit every character to a tee. Good job Studio Colorido. The plot for this first arc was very clear and concise. Every character had a unique personality nor did they seem cookie cutter. Season 1 did an excellent job of providing a foundation for the chapters to come. The viewer immediately gets a sense of the world the characters live in and its rules. Despite its short run time, I totally felt the emotions of certain characters and have become attached to quite a few that aren't the protagonists. There's just too many good things to say about Kubo's BTW and Studio Colorido. Stan Noel.",10,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_667ed46cc2,1,1153
"For those of you - like me - who have never watched Bleach, I wouldn't pay too much attention to the fans who are saying ""non-fans might not enjoy it."" Perhaps Burn The Witch makes some references that went completely over my head as a non-fan, but there wasn't a single moment that I felt like I was out of the loop. Sure, the story suffers from being so short - time constraints mean having to dump the viewer right in the middle of the action. I agree with the criticisms that say this feels like a 12 episode show and we're starting on episode 4, but I think overall they did a good job of establishing relationships, each character's personality & motivations, and a pretty significant amount of worldbuilding in just 1 hour. Everything left me wanting more, and I PRAY that one day this gets picked up as a full series, even if it gets handed off from the author to a studio for them to make their own thing out of it. (Maybe it wouldn't be as good then, maybe it would be best to keep the author on as a director/helper in the script department or whatever, I'm just hypothesising here after all...) Animation was top notch, and they really got the ""feel"" of central London down pretty well. In fact the only other show I recall getting it close to spot-on is Princess Principal. (Even Magus Bride's rendition feels kind of one-dimensional and fictional/idealized, though that one gets praised a lot. But I mean that's just my own opinion.) The OST was pretty sparse overall but what *was* there was great. I actually need to do a quick re-watch because there was one song in there somewhere that I liked a lot...

"I gotta say,Kubo sensei really did a solid job with this one. Being a Bleach fanboy,anything from Tite Kubo goes into my watchlist without me giving it a second thought. ""Burn the Witch"" was no exception in this case. When the one-shot came out,I didn’t really feel the urge to get into it. But after the serialization,I got the drive force to give the manga and the adaptation a try and it sure as hell didn’t disappoint me. In simple terms,I would say,""Burn the Witch"" felt like an anime version of J.K. Rowling's Fantastic Beasts(Hey,Harry Potter fans! Did I catch your attention with that?). But,firstly,let me clear up the confusion you’re in right now of whether this is a sequel to Bleach or is it a seperate story. It doesn’t directly involve the characters from Bleach but it does occur in the same universe. Ok.Let's get into it. The show does feel a lot like Bleach as the characters are a lot similar. But it actually works and doesn’t feel like a repetive out of place setup. The basic concepts are pretty much the same. MC is a human,he gets involved with an other worldly girl with powers and the girl is a part of a police force that supervises the control of other creatures in her reality. It does have fun characters and the story itself is interesting. Although,I would've loved to see more of the story as a one hour movie kind of felt short as it's set up in the universe of a long running anime. The animation wasn’t top notch throughout the whole thing but it's still pretty solid. The fights were perfectly done with great animation and amazing sound effects. Athough,One of the negative points this show has is that it might not be appealing to someone who's not familiar with stories from Kubo as this one attracted Bleach fans the most. If you haven’t watched it yet,step back as I'm about to spoil the story now- Earlier in the review,I did mention about this show being a lot like Fantastic Beats. So,let's look into that. Instead of the Obscurus,we have a featherless chicken that turns into a disney princess after losing contact with it's owner(I said that because it's name was Cinderella after the transformation). In case of the characters,Balgo feels like a blend of Ichigo and Kon,Noel feels like a fusion of Orihime and Unohana,Ninny feels like a combination of Hiyori and Yoruichi and Bruno is like a mixture between Grimjow and Bazz B. I liked Noel's tsundere act at the end and the Bleach logo inside the Burn the Witch logo was definitely clever. In conclusion,it's a solid and entertaining show and I would definitely recommend giving it a try.",8,Recommended,"Mar 14, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_8ee8f54288,1,2588

"I'm not the type of person who gets into every single detail and I'm also not really good at writing reviews so please don't come at me (pls). Story: It just has your usual find a problem, fix it, then there's another problem and at least one character has the desire to fix it all on their own but is backed up by the main crew later on. Also has your typical higher-up people who are like, ""We're gonna take care of it, stay out of our way!"" and one of the main characters (or just one, but we have a duo) is like, ""Nope, can't do!"" and goes all out to be a hero in the end. I think we've all seen these scenarios and the anime directors seem to can't get enough of it, so they don't wanna try to be original. If you're gonna use this scenario, I always hope it's at least interesting and unique from the others and this anime got off the hook with it, but barely passed. Art: It looks like a typical anime design (and it is), but they kept it clean and consistent, even during the fighting animations. I really like how each character looks the best rather than the scenery. The scenery barely changed throughout the movie anyway. But I like the designs and the dragon designs were nice as well. Job well done. Sound: I don't really pay attention to OSTs, but they have to be unique and good for me to notice it and even start listening to it. If I like an opening/ending, it has to be good. The ending of the first two eps were okay, but the ending on the last ep really got me jamming. So my score is a 7 just because of that ending. Character: This movie did a good job including all the typical characters: loud and determined one, reserved and follows the rules, the pervert, the one who cares about people, and the reckless with the most self confidence. I'm not gonna say who's which because I don't want to put any spoilers, but at least every character was likeable (for me, at least). Enjoyment: I actually really liked it, even though it was such a basic anime. If a basic anime goes right, it actually turns out to be really good. The plot itself was definitely not interesting, but the animation and characters made up for some of it. Overall: I'm not picky when it comes to watching anime and if you look at my list, you can tell I don't really give any bad ratings. Most of the bad ratings are in my dropped list, but when it comes to watching till the end, it shows that I enjoyed it some way.

"(This is my first review, so go easy on me...) I see a lot of people giving Burn The Witch mediocre reviews, and I think that's in-part due to the of the way the film is organized. Burn The Witch is split up into three twenty minute long ""episodes"", which ends up making it feel more like a mini-series rather than a film. As a result, it barely manages to offer up an hour of content, and viewers are left only wishing that there was more. Is that really a bad thing, though? For what content is provided, I feel as though the writers did an excellent job of answering most of the big questions, and left enough unanswered to make me wish it was a full series. In that way, this feels more like one really long pilot episode... which just happens to be split up into three episodes. Confusing, right? Is it a mini-series, a film, or a pilot episode? In any event, there seems to be a lot of meat left on the bone. The world of Burn The Witch has a lot to offer, with an interesting magic system and dragon species galore. It feels like if Harry Potter was set in the Bleach universe. That description doesn't give it enough credit though, because Burn The Witch stands alone from Bleach. It's a spin on that universe so creative that I couldn't believe it was set in the same world. The characters are endearing (albeit a little shallow on the surface), and their personalities mesh well with one-another. It's unfortunate that the run-time wasn't longer, because they didn't truly have any time to develop. This also leaves the characters being this film's weakest aspect. However, that isn't to say it detracts from the entertainment factor. I found it to be hugely entertaining, with fantastic visuals and a great score. TL;DR - It's good.

"Never have I seen an anime from a manga adapted from the author of Bleach that had turned out so good. Burn the Witch is without a doubt one of the best animated films/anime (regardless of the three-episode count) I have ever seen in 2020-2021. ---STORY--- Rating: 9 The story was set up very well with the concept on the setting of Reverse London which plays a huge part in the anime and its lore. The plot turned out to become interesting for the most part as the story advances throughout the story, though at some points may make viewers feel like the story has nothing special. However, besides the speed bumps that had underwent in the plot, I do think there are some parts in Burn the Witch that may be special in particular. The set up of Burn the Witch even reminded me of the Little Witch Academia series I watched a while back, which they are both some of the great witch anime as well. The character development here and there was evermore interesting, especially for characters Ninny Spangcole, Noel Niihashi and Macy Baljure. One scene particularly in the first act and the climax was intense and had a ton of action that is worth entertaining for many. ---ART--- Rating: 9 The art direction in Burn the Witch was pretty spectacular with the landscapes, the vastness in the environment of London/Reverse London, and the production/set design in some of the settings in the anime. There were even some scenes with amazing art in particular that help play out some of the great cinematography/layout that the film has in some sequences. ---SOUND--- Rating: 10 The sound design (mixing/editing) was incredible in Burn the Witch, alongside the fantastic original score/music composed by Keiji Inai. Though the anime has perfect voice acting and the action sequences incorporate great dragon/magic sound effects, the film orchestrates a various array of using a mix of sound effects and voice acting in some parts in a wonderful display of sound mixing/editing in anime that immerses viewers into their world. The ED song, Blowing, is no doubt harmonious. ---CHARACTERS--- Rating: 10 Along with the major and technical specs Burn the Witch had to offer as well as its imaginative character design, the characters/voice acting was the main highlight of the anime for me. Asami Tano (english dub actress Olivia Hack of Avatar: TLA and Bratz fame) has brought humor, drama and passion to her role as Ninny Spangcole, in which her character examples ambition, beauty, magical and complexion in the anime. Ninny has a tour-de-force powerhouse anime performance that I believe that she is one of the best anime girls of the year and is one of the best animated performances in my opinion this year. Yuina Yamada (english dub actress Allegra Clark) on the other hand also brought serenity, empathetic and splendor as the other main Noel Niihashi, who also brings sensitivity, courage and teamwork in every scene she's in. Saori Hayami (english dub actress Brianna Knickerbocker) apparently has one of the strongest roles/performances in the anime, exemplifying shrewdness, emotion and even humor in her role as Macy Baljure, in which, alongside Ninny, is one of the best characters in the anime and has one of the best developed character developments and backstories, showing melancholy, dignity and/or comedy in many of her scenes. Other major supporting characters in the anime, including male characters Balgo Ywain Parks (played by Shimba Tsuchiya (english dub actor Griffin Burns)) and Bruno Bangnyfe (played by Chikahiro Kobayashi (english dub actor Sean Chiplock from Re:Zero)), has shown promising and intriguing roles by playing crucial parts to the story alongside the other characters. Osushi was at least pretty cute too. ---ENJOYMENT--- Rating: 10 Hands down, I have enjoyed every minute of Burn the Witch, if its not the best anime ever (since there's also Ghibli and other anime films/series out there that are animated masterpieces). If I made my own animation awards for films and series, I'd definitely contend/nominate it for one or some awards. I know some people don't agree that Burn the Witch is great, but I for one loved it. Ninny, Noel and Macy are the best characters in Burn the Witch, in my opinion. The director, Tatsuro Kawano, has made a mesmerizing debut in his first anime direction for Burn the Witch after his commitments to key animation in various animes. ---OVERALL--- Rating: 10 (96% as a percentage) Burn the Witch was a splendorous, whimsical wonderment that's ever been adapted from a manga by the author of Bleach. I hope more of the story is told later on with a sequel in the near future, because I would love to see where their next adventures would take them next. The story was amazing with a faithful adaptation to the manga, the artwork is well done, the sound design is immersive/innovative with the use of magic/dragon sound effects, the characters along with its designs and developments absolutely shine in every scene, and the anime itself is impactful, especially for diehard Tite Kubo and Bleach fans.

"Burn the Witch is a joke. A sad, overhyped joke. I personally have not seen Bleach, so I would not understand the connections between this miniseries and Bleach, but I feel like I don't have to to be critical of this pure waste of time. While Burn the Witch is incredibly well-animated, it's so devoid of substance that I couldn't feel any emotion towards this whatsoever. All I could think was that I was glad it only lasts an hour so I wouldn't waste any more of my time on it. There are so many pieces introduced that don't end up playing any role in the show's outcome, and the pieces that do play a role are really stupid. For example, Balgo is one of the worst characters I have ever seen in an anime. His only purpose in the story is to be protected for reasons that are far beyond me, there is no indication as to what his relationships to Noel or Ninny are, and he somehow ends up as a Mary Sue in the very end. What hurts the most is that far more interesting characters get no development whatsoever. Ninny is a protagonist that simply exists, without getting nearly enough of the backstory or development she could have used to become a good protagonist. And yet somehow, Noel gets even LESS development. The show just leaves you with so many more questions than answers because it's so dedicated to the idea of doing nothing with its characters. Burn the Witch also has perhaps one of the worst climaxes I've seen in an anime. In retrospect I'm glad I felt nothing towards it because if I had somehow become invested in these characters I'm sure the final battle would have been even MORE insulting. There's no story, no satisfying combat, no genuine attempts at comedy (seriously it's almost exclusively the ""panzu"" jokes""), no good characters, and overall just nothing positive going for it aside from the animation.

But, this could lead to further reveals, and I wouldn't mind just assuming it as a premise.

"Burn the Witch was a pleasant surprise to me. It appeared really bland and mediocre on paper. Moreover, I have never read even a single chapter of Bleach, forget about being a fan of it. But still, the movie did a pretty decent job at entertaining me within its span of an hour. I'll explain why. Burn the Witch takes place in the city of London. It mainly revolves around two witches, Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, who are a part of an organization named Wing Bind. Their job is to protect and cope with dragons that are invisible to most people and cause the majority of the deaths in London. Needless to say, the premise of Burn the Witch isn't very unique. However, as I have always said, the story doesn't need to be completely unique in order to be compelling. If executed properly, even shows with the most unoriginal plots can be very entertaining to watch. Initially, Burn the Witch seems to follow that formula pretty well. Though, the problem with the plot becomes apparent as we move onto the second episode. Burn the Witch can be a bit overambitious at times. It tries to tell way too much story than it actually needs to. It wants to narrate a lot bigger story, but fails at doing so because of its short span. If the movie had run for 30 extra minutes, it could've done a much better job at world building and storytelling. But that isn't to say the plot is completely irredeemable. Despite not being particularly innovative or outstanding, it does a decent job at keeping the viewers engrossed in watching. But as I said before, just taking a little more time with the world building and storytelling could've been really efficient in making the plot even more enjoyable. Because of that exact reason, most characters don't get the chance to be fully fleshed out either. Not enough time is given to properly develop all of them, which can become a little problematic later on. They aren't unlikeable in any way, though. They all have their distinct and likeable characteristics which make them pretty entertaining. Our protagonists, Noel and Nana, are really likeable and their interactions are always amusing to watch. The backstory of Macy and Elly is also presented decently. Even Bruno, who seemed like a huge asshole, turned out to be a not-so-bad person in the end. I especially enjoyed Balgo's personality; his idiotic nature and uselessness might annoy some viewers, but I personally found it very appealing. In case of animation, Burn the Witch does a pretty decent job. Studio Colorido isn't the most renowned studio out there, but they handled the animation greatly in this case. The character designs are distinct and attractive. The dragons are decorated nicely in terms of designs as well. While some action scenes feel kinda stiff, most of them are very decently animated. The voice acting and soundtrack are also very decent. Most background tracks, despite not being very memorable, are befitting to the movie, which makes the fight scenes more dynamic and enjoyable. There isn't any opening theme, but the ending song ""Blowing"" sung by NiL is kinda catchy. To summarize, Burn the Witch is a pretty enjoyable movie. A little more runtime could've helped fix some of the issues regarding the narrative, but the movie was quite good for what it was. So if you are looking for a short but entertaining movie full of epic action and goofy characters, give Burn the Witch a try.",7,Recommended,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_4904f3675a,1,3411
"Cons: This three episodes transition and pacing isn't good, the way the episodes end aren't well done. It feels like they just wanted to squeeze some artwork with a catchy song at the end. The world building wasn't that good but not terrible, you could understand in a way what the world is in a few minutes. The main characters aren't bad, they're good characters. The supporting characters are just there, they could've played a better role in the story (specially Banx). Balgo is just annoying and useless. Pros: The world has an interesting setting Good artwork and sound Likeable main characters It's an enjoyable watch The pacing isn't that bad Overall: This one-shot has the potential to become a good anime, just fixing the pacing problem might be enough sense that's the main problem. It has a good setting, with supporting characters that can be great if they are done right, with two main characters that might become popular, sense there personalities are quite good.",7,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e047fb5fd3,2,979
"Burn The Witch is a average movie. The 3 episode format led to a unnecessary ending for two episodes when it should have just been put all together for fluidity. Story was nothing special but nothing trash. Plot twists were cool but generic. Characters were extremely average to me but Noel and Ninny got thighs so thats a plus. The interactions between the two main females are funny, sometimes. Animation once again is average and non-memorable. In conclusion, if you have a rough 1 hour of time to do anything, watch Burn The Witch if you just wanna pass time, but do not expect anything amazing.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_812eb3f85f,2,599
"Don't be mistaken: This is just a prologue. The movie adapts ""Season One"" of the Burn the Witch manga... which is only 4 chapters, with a Season Two confirmed to come at some point in the future. If you're familiar with Tite Kubo of Bleach fame, you will be able to tell that he plans on expanding this series way beyond this first movie. Story: 5/10. There are two things you need to know before jumping into this movie. The first: it's a sequel to the original Burn the Witch one-shot. Yes, not an adaptation, a sequel. The events of the one-shot still happened, but you don't get to see any of it. This is why you're just thrown into the series' world, without any real introduction to its main characters. The second: the story is incomplete. As I mentioned above, this movie, as well as the first season of the manga that it adapts, is a prologue. It serves to introduce you to Ninny, Noel, Balgo and a few other characters before the ""real story"" actually begins... Which is very weird, considering that the manga went into indefinite hiatus as soon as Season One was done, so we actually don't have that ""real story"" yet. Let's talk about the movie's story, for what it's worth. Two girls work for an agency that handles dragons, both friendly and useful, as well as aggressive and dangerous. They're currently taking care of this really annoying guy called Balgo, and if you want to know why... you have to read the one-shot. This is bad story-telling. Nothing indicates that the movie is a sequel to the one-shot, and you'll only find out about this if you do research on the series on your own, because there is NOTHING that alludes to why or how they got stuck with Balgo, which raises a lot of questions and confuses the viewer when they start throwing around terms that are explained in the one-shot... but not in the movie. You shouldn't have to do homework in order to understand the basic premise and world of your movie. Looking over this HUGE flaw, the story is... ok. Nothing special, for a prologue. It's meant to introduce you to the characters and establish the world and it does that fine enough, even if a bit clunky sometimes. Art: 8/10. It's Kubo. The man who achieved ""Big Three"" status on drawing cool shit alone. The character designs are great, which has always been his strong point, and the animation by Studio Colorido is fluid and pleasing to look at. There is a lot of flying around in this, as you'd expect from a show about witches, and it's all pretty well done. Spells look a bit boring for the most part, with the exception being the spells cast by Bruno, which are very creative in how they're cast and look different enough from the rest, which are basically just light being shaped differently. Yeah it's all a bit samey but it's not what I'd describe as bad, at all. Sound: 6/10. The voice acting is good, everyone fits their character and helps the movie sell you on who these people are. The background music was fine, if a bit unremarkable. The same could be said about the ending song, it did its job fine enough, but it's not like it's particularly memorable or something that I'd add to my anisong playlist, for example. Character: 7/10. Kubo knows how to write likable characters, even if he doesn't really know what to do with them as the series goes on. He also knows how to write insufferable characters. Case in-point: Balgo. Balgo is by far the worst thing about this series. Comic-relief characters are hard to write, I know that, and if you're not careful enough, you end up with a character like Balgo, a complete useless tag-along whose only role in the movie is to ""be funny"". I did not find him funny, I found him incredibly irritating. Everyone else is good, for what little we've seen of them. The two main characters are your typical energetic-apathetic dynamic, but what I like about them is that neither one of them is your typical hero(ine). They're both selfish, Noel is greedy and Ninny is ambitious to a fault, disregarding rules and even the safety of London citizens to prove herself worthy of a promotion. Their dynamic is nothing new but it was enough for me to want to see more of them. Other relevant characters include hot-headed, over-confident Bruno Bangnyfe, which is my favorite character thanks to a combination of great character design, cool powers and scene-stealing personality which is a Kubo classic; Macy Baljure, whose only real role in the prologue is to be cute and naive which I assume is to establish that she's going to be changing a lot throughout the series (whenever that decides to start); and Ninny and Noel's boss Billy Binx, Jr., a laid-back and lazy character who is pretty charming considering his small screen-time. The movie also introduces the Top of Horns, the rulers of the Wing Bind association, but their appearance is very brief, only serving to, again, assure the viewers that the story is only at its beginning. Honestly I would give it an 8/10 if Balgo wasn't so damn annoying. Enjoyment: 7/10. It's fun. That's all I can really say about this series so far, really. It did get me interested in seeing the rest of the story, which I guess was the purpose of the movie. It feels incomplete because well... it is. In a way this movie is just a big advertisement for Burn the Witch Season 2, whenever that decides to show its face on Weekly Shonen Jump. On its own, I'd give it a light 7/10.",7,Recommended,"Dec 4, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_506fc0782f,2,5404
"I am going to start with the positives first. The animation is amazing, to the point that I feel bad the it going to be associated with this show's everything else. Also, it had some interesting worldbuilding ideas but it didn't explore that nearly enough. Ok that's the positives, now the negatives. The story feels both rushed and stalled at all times, I'm not even sure how that's possible. Things will just happen as if it was an already established, meaning there is little no explanation why things happen, but then there will be a 10 minutes of talking about nothing with characters we never met. This entire show feels as if you started a long-running Shonen on episode 50, which just so happened to be halfway into the arc where they introduce the over-arcing villain of the story. It just tries to gaslight the viewer into believing that the characters and the world have already been set up and that there was an actual story being told. I had to check many times to see if this was a sequel or prequel or a part of a franchise or that there was some thing that tied everything together, but no there wasn't.

"It probably should be more of an 8 rather than 9 but seeing this many nagging reviews... This piece has HUGE potential. In those few episodes it manages to show the universe (like scanning codes to open portals, using phones to keep track of their progress, those areas being locked by hidden fences) a plethora or characters (that don't look or act alike), great art (with plenty of detail and without those dumb underwear shots), good music (though unfortunately rarely played), a few twists (like that fingershot at the end) and jokes, everything being mixed in overall dark (or just far from fairytale) mood. Plot overall wasn't the best but... how can all this be squeezed in 60 minutes and reasonably development? Obviously it was rushed but characters are not irritably stupid, act naturally, dialogues and situations are well above good and I wish it would not have ended so abruptly, though they just had in order to have certain closure (unlike many others) and that just ears them more respect points.

I was trying my best not to hype it up in my mind, but it managed to exceed my expectations entirely. I definitely hope, despite how unlikely it is, that this will be developed into a full fledged series, because the potential is amazing. The animation is smooth and super high quality, the choreography is amazing, and the visuals are just very pleasant and engaging. I found the two main characters very interesting, personally. Ninny is an automatic fave from me. The world building is pretty neat! Not entirely original but vague enough to be expanded on and twisted into something new. The concept of Front and Shadow London is pretty cool! I kind of want to know more about how that works! The world building and overall plot would be phenomenal for a longer show, and I really would love to have more. Like... what are the repercussions of traveling between the two? Do some of the characters have split lives based in each world, what is that like? I think this is so cool! Also, I just love dragons and girls being badass so... I'm all here for this!

"It's always upsetting to see such a good-looking show end up being all form over substance. Unfortunately, things such as stellar animation, beautiful colours, interesting looking art style, and cool character designs can't carry the overall chaotic direction and extremely rushed, poorly written plot. ""Burn the Witch"" offers a very nice and intriguing setting that serves as mere background to a story that's just half-baked. Half-baked, because how would one call a situation when viewers are supposed to care about anything and anyone, when all they learn throughout the show is that ""this place exists, this person exists as well""? Why do viewers have to learn about presumably important and strong secondary characters, see them saying a phrase or two, and afterwards not hear anymore about most of them, or just see them being somewhere in the background and saying something cryptic that's also not elaborated upon later on? Many high schoolers would write a better scenario, even for such a short animated series. It's even worse if we consider that without knowing the prequel movie, which was released 3 years (!) after the reviewed series, the viewers will have a hard time figuring out what the heck is exactly happening in the story, why do some situations occur, and why do certain characters act like they do. Yup, ""Burn the Witch"" doesn't offer any introduction, not without watching the ""Burn the Witch #0.8"" prequel movie. Speaking about its length, there are three episodes, and each one is 20 minutes long. In theory, that would be alright to tell a cute story. That is, if the writing was at least on an acceptable level. Sadly, like I mentioned earlier, the writing was mediocre at best, but most of the time it was chaotic and messy. The direction was weird as well, as if the show couldn't find balance between more static and more dynamic scenes, but preferred to just mix them up and end up with a rather convoluted mess. Some might say that it was like this in the source material. Some might say that this show fits the ""Bleach"" universe in which it is set. I'm neither familiar with the first nor the second thing, so as an anime only viewer, I can't relate to any of them. However, even if I had knowledge about one thing or another, I wouldn't treat it as something positive. If an anime is not labelled as a spin-off series, then it's not unwise to assume that one may enjoy the story without knowing the main series, no? Obviously, a shared universe is not the same as a shared story, after all. And at the end of the day, we're talking about an animated show that is loosely related to an already existing series. The fact that source material was worse or better, or that some elements might make more sense if someone is familiar with said existing series, shouldn't matter, in my opinion. I was torn between choosing ""Mixed Feelings"" or ""Negative"" as the final verdict for this review. I think the former will be more appropriate. I don't regret watching it myself. It didn't take a lot to watch the reviewed show and the aforementioned prequel movie, after all. Although, I can't recommend this show if you care about anything else than its great-looking visuals. Not with all the cons this show has, which I pointed out earlier.",4,Mixed Feelings,"Apr 9, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_531c7a3724,2,3268
"That's a nice movie to watch, don't expect a masterpiece from a hour movie, but you won't regret spend that time on this title, I wish that title will get a tv shows seasons in the future cause it definitely deserves it. First of all the movie take place in the same universe as Bleach but it's in London and as y'all seen in trailer it's different than a well known Bleach world. It also bring a little bit of nostalgia, especially that characters gives you a 100% vibes of Tite Kubo drawing style and not gonna lie Bruno Bangnyfe give Grimmjow vibes unfortunately these characters don't share the voice actor. Story: It's good, but too rushed, alot of people will disagree with my point of view, but let's be honest you don't need to know everythign about a world to enjoy the movie and that's what happens here, a short plot with introducing a little bit of the world, of the main characters and with few actions. Art: I really like the art style of Tite Kubo which is visible in this movie and I love that fact, also i want to point out something which some people like some doesn't it's the specific art of background which in my opinion is familiar to Owari no Seraph background art, for me it was great the whole Reverse London looked incredible. Sound: Well that's a too short movie to even notice anything, the sound effect during actions is quite good, there is only one soundtrack which I memorised from that movie which is the main theme of burn the witch and that's all what I can say about that, unfortunately I didn't like that much of voice acting for Bruno. Character: They are unique but not unique at the same time, the art style and their look like is something which will make you remember these characters but their personalities is something which you can definitely find in another titles and it makes you forget about the character, the example is that Noel for me is like a female version of Ishida from Bleach and as I said before Bruno is similar to Grimmjow, but to be honest I like very much his balaclava, clothing for mouth i don't know how to properly call it in english. Enjoyment: That's a short and good movie to watch in an evening, to eat some pop-corn, chips or some other snaccs and just chill out while watching it, without thinking about what's gonna happen, who is who, who will do what, who will survive, etc. Just a simple story for a chilling which I personally like. Overall : 8/10 I really hope that burn the witch manga will have more opportunities for develop and will not have to be rushed like Bleach to give time for Kubo to make and procces this title for a better score, I hope that I will oneday be watching week by week episodes of Burn the Witch if that's gonna happen, I will be positive that it will happen, when?

Since there is so little of it I don't think there is much for me to dislike in it really, the one nitpick I would say is Balgo's subs voice is a little too whiny for my liking.

"Up until this point, Bleach had always had bad luck at adapting anything outside of its main TV series, the movies, the specials, everything just had to suck one way or the other, so when I heard of Burn The Witch, Kubo Tite's new One-Shot getting an animation short series, I had my doubts, and so, I help on the hype, I gave it time, and only decide to watch it recently, maybe, anything I was fearing would not come to pass. And man, did Kubo ever slapped me this hard since the early days of Bleach. Story (7.5/10): I'm only going for what I saw on these three episodes, because had it been a tad longer and more things were explore, this would have been an easy 8 if not more. These three episodes felt like the Romance Dawn arc of One Piece, it's super short, it has the spirit, but does not tell everything, no, no way near half of everything. You feel like setting the stone into a grand world build on top of Bleach's, but which entirely new and more expressive lore that followed everything thing. This felt like if Ghibli Studio were to animate a series instead of a movie more than not. Art (9.2/10): Close to perfection. The art style is there, the color palette, also there, the animation is dynamic and fluid, and the cinematography and camera angles were not of an average Anime screening. This was the best any of Kubo Tite's animate characters looked, and I hope it's a ten that will follow with the 1000 years blood arc of Bleach, Inshallah. The characters felt really, really fresh and new, but also very familiar and nostalgic, I guess Kubo is one of the few Mangaka that persists his signature art even as he improves it. Also, more of a reminder that Kubo really did miss a promising future as a fashion designer because the clothing and customs here are a moo of their own. Sound (8.3/10): I did not notice anything out of place, audibly speaking, the voice acting was sharp and great, the emotions were delivered, the passive-aggressive commentary was there and hit the comedic effect they aimed at, such a shame that no opening song came with this, but the ending was a great pleasurable treat. The OSTs were good and felt organic and part of the scenes, however, not quite on Bleach's level, to say the least. Characters (8/10): Obviously, we saw no character development “that mattered” in these three episodes, but it's fine as the start of the story is yet to unfold. The cast however is very varying and alive, with different characters with different interactions and charisma, never a dull moment of a boring conversation. The main duo, Noelle and Nina was just the right nail to seal this story, both great in opposing ways, which keeps it interesting and fresh, with countless of Shounen that features males as the primary main characters, it's about time we saw things differently from a protagonistic female ^point of view. Enjoyment (10/10): Three episodes were never going to be enough for this great showing. I certainly I not feel like I was gonna enjoy this this much, but I'm glad I did. Overall (8.6/10): That I better than was anticipating. Kudos to Kubo sensei for this new work, and looking forward to featuring sequels.

"Burn the Witch (2020) Whilst this was released as 3 episodes and not a movie and it would be a fairly short movie over the average I must say it was actually unexpectedly good. Whilst some of it can seem crude it actually does most of what it wants to right. The story has got a few pacing issues and would have made more sense being 3 episodes as part of a larger season but then its from a one-shot manga. It is a shame because the premise of the show is really interesting. The art although it can be a bit crude is perfectly good for the show. The majority of the art is a very high standard and what I love so much is the facial expressions when such things as Star Ash get near their faces. It is hilarious and so well thought out. The soundtrack generally is excellent and the SFX it produces was also excellent. Characters develop in as much as you learn who they are as much as you can in 3 episodes without derailing the story. The two main girls Noel and Ninny are really well thought out characters. Overall, It is definitely worth a watch. Is it a shame it probably won't ever come back?

"Is it worth watching? probably yes but get ready for some unnecessary mentions of pantsu and a dumb, blond, annoying dude. The setting looks amazing, the story looks interesting, the characters are a bit cliché and the fanservice is cringe. The setting is the city of london, cool place especially considering that for obvious reasons most anime don't have europeans settings, in this case London is a magical city sort of, the world has weird and well designed dragons and they are up to no good or atleast some of them. With all these creatures and magic there had to be, as the title says, witches and they are divided in different groups sorted by their tasks. Watching the prequel makes the story better since there is 1 character that looks a bit odd in the story but if you watched the prequel it should all make sense, anyway this anime made me so upset that i had to write my first review. It looks like someone took a perfect recipe and then chose to buy expired ingredients to make it. The story is very dynamic it starts right in the middle of some action losing little to no time explaining the backgroud of the world which is fine in this case, it makes everything really engaging and it allows the spectator to learn about the backstory in a less stagnant way. The main characters are fun and boring at the same time, you have Noel and Ninny that have very different personalities and they of course get on eachother nerves from time to time. Then you have Billy the chief of these 2 little witches, he's the typical character that looks like he's almost lost in his own world just to then realize he is smart and all and was just playing the part. At this point you get Balgo a character that has a flat personality he literally doesnt seem to be able to think like a normal human being, as dumb as a rock and cringe, his main goal in life is watching some ""pantsu"" same goes for his stupid dog that keeps repeating this deside of its owner. I just started watching this anime and i haven't read anything yet so i don't know where the story is going to go but the feeling that you get once Balgo gets on screeen is enough to turn your TV off even though everything else is amazing. This really looks like a missed opportunity, could have been such a cool anime and story but as far as i've watched it doesn't seem to become anything above the usual anime that you'd watch when you are bored but nothing more especially thanks to the fact that it looks like it's written for a 13yo with all this pantsu here and pantsu there.",7,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 14, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_a74ef1ea5d,2,2540
"A fun introduction to a cool concept (that turned out later on to be something a little more), 'Burn The Witch' is simple but generally effective. It doesn't explain a huge amount about it's world (even burying the lead of what world it even is until the end), but trickles the details through well enough that I don't consider most of it confusing. There's perhaps a couple of details I'd have preferred them to be a bit more upfront about, like what the seemingly separate divisions of Wing Bind actually do, but those things don't get in the way too much. And many of the other things that are left vaguer, such as just what a Dragonclad actually is, feel more deliberate than careless; after all, with more manga on the way, there's plenty of time to open the world up more. The characters don't get time to get deep development yet, but Ninny and Noel are an enjoyable enough pairing, with a decent energy around them, and the supporting cast in the status quo the ending establishes should be enough to build a story around going forward. The story of the film itself is a strong enough pilot. Certainly, it's not especially complex, but it throws in a couple of surprising enough beats, and does its job of introducing the world and characters perfectly adequately.

"Coming from Tite Kubo, the same author as Bleach, is Burn the Witch. Although not the most impressive start to a series i’ve seen, Burn the Witch is simply charming. From its clean animation and fantastical world to its badass designs and stupid humor, it had me entertained from beginning to end. I really only have two criticisms and first would be that it needs more source material to work with. Many characters come off as pretty flat, uninspired, and maybe even annoying in the case of Balgo. My second complaint would be one that even plagued Bleach. As story-beats fly by, it becomes apparent that the world and its mechanics need more time to be fleshed out and explained. Everything in the world just happens without any real explanation, and only becomes more confusing when remembered that BTW and Bleach somehow take place in the same world. This only leads me to one final conclusion, and that is we need more Burn The Witch. You should definitely watch this if you haven’t already watched it.

"Spoiler free review: After seeing so many other negative reviews, i'm just gonna say this: THE STORY MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE IF YOU READ THE ONE-SHOT MANGA CHAPTER FIRST!!! It's just 60 pages or so, and it's totally worth it. While I wouldn't say it's required viewing/reading, the story WILL flow significantly better having read the chapter. After all, the ""movie"" adapts chapters 1 - 4 in the manga, and those all occur after the original one-shot. It helps to flesh out the characters with proper, longer introductions, including Balgo Parks, such as explaining how he obtained his ""abilities"" and Noel's relations with him. Now, finally, all of that aside, what do I actually think of the ""movie""? It was great! Obviously it wasn't flawless, and it could've used maybe another ""episode"" to flesh out the greater details (maybe adapt a little of the one-shot chapter, though that may take more than an entire ""episode""); however, in terms of adapting what they set out to adapt. they did a great job. The scenes in the manga were definitely enhanced with the music and beautiful animation. Many scenes were conveyed better to me in the animation than the manga, and the amazing dynamic ""camera angles"" really sold the fights. The voice acting is great, the story is quite decent (though the start may seem off-putting without having read the one-shot), and although it doesn't get quite enough time to flesh out the characters, they do have their own unique personalities (Osushi is the cutest thing ever, change my mind). Overall, I give Burn the Witch an 8/10. A solid experience, but please, for the love of anime, and for the thousandth time, READ THE ONE-SHOT FIRST!!!",8,Recommended,"Oct 3, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_7e036b59ef,2,1675
"I honestly think this was a pretty cool 3 episodes and I would GLADLY watch an entire anime based on this that continued this story. Also, I think that one thing people get wrong about this one-shot is that it's meant to be like a base of sorts, one guy explained it well saying it's like a pilot episode for a series. A pretty good story that would make a great anime and the story introduced could be grown upon greatly! The art was pretty great, though I can't say much cause of spoilers Sound also great, fit the scenes pretty well IMO Characters were for the most part interesting, though one thing that people keep bringing up is how flat they are and no development, but seriously guys, it's 3 episodes.

"To best summarize how I feel, it's a nice watch but it just feels too short and incomplete. It's as almost they were planning a season for the anime and then realized they only had a budget for three episodes. So the ""movie"" is three episodes of ~20 minutes or about an hour long. That's not a lot of time to make a complete and satisfactory story. There needs to be time to set up the plot, get some background and a foundation for the story, create characters and explain their quirks and relationships, etc... There just isn't enough time for that in an hour movie... Even worse, it feels like the movie drops you right into episode 6 of a season (of 13 episodes). Two minutes of a backstory isn't enough to fully nurture a good story. Even worse it tries to get to the last episode of season if the span of time equal to three episodes... which is a bit too rushed. There isn't any real growth in the characters... and characters show up but they just don't have any major importance to the movie at all. That aside, what I watched... I enjoyed. It was a fun watch and I see potential for anime series that could work and I would be down to watch that if that were the case. There needs to be more time to explain things and not to have them throw everything to the viewers in just one hour. This could have worked as a movie.. but in the end it just turned out three episodes that were treated as a movie which just doesn't work out that well. Perhaps the creators didn't have a choice in that manner... which is a shame because I do see some positives in Burn the Witch.",7,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_7c6c2355e3,2,1576
"I've never read or seen much of Bleach, but I'm certain that this show has nothing to do with the plot of it other than being in the same universe, and is perfectly enjoyable without the knowledge of Bleach. What appealed to me when scouting for something, anything to watch, was the character designs, which are pleasant enough to look at even when they're not moving. I was pleased to see that, in motion, the characters are detailed and distinct enough, as well as plenty expressive enough for me to enjoy my time watching the show even if I had the sound turned off and had no clue what was happening. I'm pretty confident you actually could watch these three episodes without any sound and interpret a general idea of what was happening anyways. That is the sign of a competently made animation is my opinion. Tite Kubo wrote the story as a one shot, and I think the concept is creative, the two central characters are at least entertaining to see interact with each other and the world around them. Ninny and Noel have distinct enough personalities and designs that fit well with Studio Colorido's interpretation of London. Kubo's character designs blend and move well with the environment thanks to the animation team's talent and, I assume, damn good budget, considering the only three episodes. The story felt to me somewhat interesting, but of course not really that impressive considering the length of the one shot. You have three episodes to decide if the characters are worth following, because really that's what drew me in and kept me watching, aside from the gratifying animation of course. If Kubo decides to expand on what he's created here, I insist he do so. I imagine he could do quite a lot given what he's already done, considering the cool magic system, entertaining characters, interesting setting, and of course a promising animation direction. Are these three episodes worth your time? I think so; there's a lot to appreciate here. And if the designs are to your liking, you'll probably get enough out of this show to feel satisfied when it's over, which will unfortunately be very quickly.",7,Recommended,"Oct 21, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e75653fa20,2,2118
"So let's get this out of the way the story for burn the witch is nonexistent. While I do love the amazing voice acting, art, and the character design that can only carry a story so far. Yes, a world of free-roaming dragons being left unchecked is a problem. But burn the witch feel way too forced when it already has a believable base to it. That followed by a lack of explanation into the actual problem make the story a wild mess to watch that is only made bearable by some really amazing main and supporting cast. Ninny and Noel are just a straight-up adorable duo they really save the story. that being said Osushi-chan obsession with Noel panties leaves me with the biggest smile.

"I thought Burn the Witch is an anime series. I never knew that it's a movie split into three episodes. Here are the high points. The world building is pretty neat with London being split into two dimensions--one of them being the magic realm. I like the way it treats its rules with nuance with the characters casually giving the audience information about how things work without looking like exposition. The magic in the story is also unique, somehow modernizing the witch motifs. The female leads are also fun to watch. The male major character is also charming and the other female character that showed up near the end is also interesting. Here are the not so high points. Burn the Witch forgot it's a movie and instead acted like the first three episodes of an ongoing anime series. Alongside its worldbuilding, it introduces new mysteries and conflicts that implies that you have to keep watching to figure them out but that won't happen because it's a movie. As a result, there's no clear narrative or conclusion. This weakness in the writing has dragged the story down significantly. That being said, the production value is pretty good. The animation and artwork is great with a pretty good OST. The character designs really pop. I never watched Bleach so it's only after the ending card and further research that I realized that this is set in the Bleach universe. Overall, Burn the Witch as a stand alone movie isn't the best. I hope there's a continuation because the story that's about to unfold has promise.",7,Recommended,"Dec 5, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_5781e3c236,3,1522
"Burn The Witch, the newest piece of fiction related to the well known Bleach series by Tite Kubo, It's been awhile since I've written a review, so apologies if it's not the best written review. Story: The Story of Burn The Witch is an interesting one and very different from that of Bleach, in this case we're not talking Soul Reapers or Hollows, as this takes place in the London or rather Front London and Reverse London, and focuses on a pair of witches working for a organization called Wing Bind, who deal with dragons, and dragons cause roughly 72% of deaths in London are caused by dragons, Wing Bind will protect dragons if necessary even raising them, other times they have to kill dragons, but the story outside of that focuses Ninny and Noel, who have to do their job for Wing Bind but also protect Balgo a Dragonclad, as dragons are attracted to him due to being a Dragonclad. I give the story an 8 (Very Good), it's interesting and distinct from others. Art: The art and animation is really good in this anime and it nails down the art style of Tite Kubo, and that for me is enough to give it a 9 (Great). Sound: The sound is good, voice acting and music were good, but I can't say it was amazing or bad, as such a 7 (Good) for the sound. Character: The characters are interesting and largely do complement eachother Ninny is a driven character with her own goals with her job at Wind Bind, and being a celebrity infront london, Noel is a character who largely follows the book to some extent, but is willing to do two person jobs in order to get the rewards for herself. Balgo may be an annoying character to some, with his head over heels feelings for Noel, but he isn't super over the top and just avoids being that one annoying character that I hated. Other characters are given brief introductions, that give you a relative decent impression of what sort of characters they are, but you do not get bombarded with information about them, for example there are multiple characters who are high ranking members and you can fully guess the type of character they would be from their designs and the way they present themselves. For the characters I give it an 8 (Very Good). Enjoyment: This is something that is very much different to the other categories, as the enjoyment for each person that watches this anime will depend on not only the previous categories but also any prior knowledge and/or enjoyment of related works, I was very much a fan of Tite Kubo's Bleach and the Burn The Witch manga one shot and series so far as well as some of his other works, the fact that the characters are different from others in his other works, the fact the anime captures Tite Kubo's art style pretty well, it was truly a 10 (Outstanding) for me, but it may very well be anywhere from 1 to a 9 for others, but to me it was truly a 10. Overall: so overall the way I do these written reviews where I go through the different things like story, art, sound, etc. I will give an average score, so summary here's the scores > Story: 8 > Art: 9 > Sound: 7 > Character: 8 > Enjoyment: 10 > Overall: 8.4 I recommend it for general anime fans, any fans of magical/fantasy shows, but personally I would say if you're a fan of Bleach or any works by Tite Kubo, this is a must watch.",8,Recommended,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0e4ac3ab86,3,3277

Have the right expectations going in; good art check, good music and sound check, good shonen level enjoyment check, good story no (hopefully its coming in the future).

"Being a long time Bleach fan(for like 10 years or so) made me really happy to hear about Kubo's next work called Burn the Witch ,but for some reason I totally forgot it for months and remembered it some days ago. So there is not much to say about the series due to the fact that it consists of 3 episodes .It's not even close to its end ,but I have to say that I'm really intrigued in it. There was something really beautiful about the artstyle in these episodes ,especially the way the enviroment around the characters is drawn.The animation was pretty cool too. Well we still have very little info about the plot ,but it really seems to have the potential to become pretty good. The characters are pretty likeable and fun to watch,unlike a large amount of new anime/manga casts that tend to make me feel like ''ah I really don't care about these guys'' I would recommend it ,it's pretty promising and a really enjoyable small pack of episodes",7,Recommended,"Jun 17, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_35c6704b84,3,944
"The good: The animation is excellent and the super stylized character design is typical of Tite kubo which is excellent if you love the art of bleach, the world and premise are imaginative, the action scenes are entertaining. The bad: the story moves very fast, it does not let you familiarize with the environment and characters, although you cannot expect much from a 50-minute movie, just don't expect a deep story and three-dimensional characters. In conclusion: Its a fun and ejoyable movie/miniseries but as i stated before the story moves at flash speed and there are so many elements not explained or expanded on, I hope and one day the creators will make a complete and proper anime series and take their time to expand on their world and how it works as well as the characters and their past, the lore of this anime have so much potential and dont want to watch it being wasted just in this movie.

"I have to say I very mush enjoyed watching this. While not finding anything very thrilling to watch this season, this was really refreshing! Something about the mood and the tone that was set in the very beginning really hooked me and urged me to keep watching. The animation and the fights was very clean. I loved the team work and fight moves the girls had together. The character dynamic between the main girls is great. It create a good balance. Now what I did not like. It felt very rushed. I had just meant the character and next time I know they where fighting the main boss? I wish it did a bit more world building and explain things more. If this ""movie"" has J.K Rolling style world building the would be top tier 10/10. Maybe if the had more eps/ movie time?? A bigger budget? source material I don’t know ? It left me with two many un answered question. What are they flying on dragons? Why are there's so small ? Who is their boss? What association are involved. Whats up with the sword? Also the one thing I hate is when they skip part of the story and flash forward like nothing happened. It really reduced the impact of the big boss fight.

Although it had potential, it didn't quite leave a strong impact in terms of story structure. I appreciate the 3 episode series for giving Ninny and Macy some human-like elements and insight into their internal struggles and morals. The episodes do give us a glimpse of Noel's vulnerable side; however, not much was explored for her character. Balgo was a fun addition to keep the show balanced with the tense moments.

"This anime was released this season in 2020 and was supposed to be an anime film, but for one reason or the other, the producers ended up making this a short three episode series. Because of the length, however, some negative aspects really seemed to stand out. But, before that, the positive. The animation was very clean, especially when a good chunk of the series had the two witches flying around, evading enemies or buildings in a stylish way. The character designs were also very well done, especially when it came to non-human aspects such as the dragons. The action scenes were not overly dramatic but they certainly had their own charm and made you excited for the battle itself. Some things, however, did not go as smoothly. The characters themselves were a little too on the nose. I understand that this was only three episodes, but they only really stuck to one generic characteristic. For now, there was not a lot of depth into their characters or personalities. This was based on a manga of the same name in 2018, which has since announced that there will be a second season of the manga. Because of this, and the relative success of the anime adaptation, it is very likely that there will be a legitimate season, not a three episode/film sort of thing. Lastly, this may be a slight spoiler so be warned. This is officially set inside of the popular Shonen Jump anime Bleach universe. This can be realized at the end of the third episode where a sign is established over the company labeled “Western Branch of Soul Society”. With a new season of Bleach coming at us sometime in 2021, Burn the Witch certainly could be involved in one way or the other, something many fans are now excited about. But, all in all, I did enjoy this anime. I certainly do not regret it, especially since it was only three episodes. If you are looking for something new to lightly binge, here you go!

"this my first review in My Animelist, so this just my personal opinion and don't take it very seriously To be Honest this movie is feels more like a pilot episode for the anime series (which is i hope is coming soon). Despite being very impresive for 3 episode Anime, this movie does'nt feel solid. The visualis good, the sound design is also good, the characther is fine, but the story is that makes this movie does'nt solid at all (at least what i feel when i watch it from non-manga reader perspective). We got a little naration for what happened here and the world of this anime, but that is nothing more. And the story is like in the middle of the series it self (we have nothing know to start the series and the ending just cliffhanger). I think the purpose of this Movie is just to show what the studio can do, and what would be like if Burn the witch is adapted to anime.

"Burn the Witch obviously at this stage some obvious flaws as a result of getting pushed into such a small time frame but despite that I still think it was a fun watch. I feel like Kubo really wanted to go in a younger more colorful direction in contrast with the edgy and angsty style of Bleach and he has done that very well. This being set in the Bleach universe also brings up a lot of questions regarding what dragons are. Since they are basically a version of hollow, what would dragons be? Hollows come from the souls of humans while dragons seem to breed and hatch from eggs. How does the power system work? Could the Chief beat Goku? I came out of this with more questions than answers.

"*Spoiler warning!* Story/Plot 6/10 - The pace was pretty good for a 3 episode anime and the plot was fairly interesting, it was also cool the anime was set in the same universe as Bleach! But, that's about where all the good for the story and plot end. The anime was way too short and they left us with more questions than things we got answered.

Bruno is downright preppy, rude, and acts better than everyone, and Balgo's entire personality is messing things up, being a simp over Noel, and barely (Or not) being able to protect himself.

"A fun little romp in a magical London with dragons and 2 charming female leads.

Keep along with ""Noel & Ninni,"" the well-known kouhai/senpai team in WB (Wing Bind), as they cope with a misfortunate pervert who can't seem to quit attracting these lethal beasts. You won't find the most brilliantly written characters or the most compelling world-building in this fantasy tale. The anime has an introduction and all the necessary elements to begin a plot, but by the time it's over, it feels like you've simply watched a bunch of episodes from the middle of a previously aired show. With the exception of that hint at the end, I'm not sure whether this has any significant connections to Bleach, but this ONA stands on its own. Even if it lacks a complete plot, the anime has the potential to be an even more enjoyable journey. The anime's aesthetic department is unquestionably its most outstanding feature. The visuals alone are worth a watch, thanks to the appealing character designs, vibrant animation, and frequently spectacular camera movement during its action scenes. Additionally, the campy credits song is a nice way to conclude each episode, except it's not really essential. The fact that this collection of ONAs is a collection rather than a film makes it one of the biggest issues with it. It turns out that it was a movie originally only released in Japan as a one-hour film. Crunchyroll, however, had the strange idea to split the movie into three parts, which not only destroys the flow of the story but also creates a needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. They had to cut out a chapter from the source material (that chapter 0 gives a backstory as to why Balgo needs special attention, aka why he's necessary to the plot). Even though the emotional plot it builds for its characters doesn't reach its utmost height, considering the timeframe, the creators did a respectable job of getting their message out loud and clear with two female protagonists carrying the show with their charm. However, there are a few pointless kinks that can cause some people to avert their gaze. Who should watch this? Unless you're finding for something complete, I see no reason to not watch this ONA.

"While Japan has Shinigami and Hollows, England has witches and dragons, on the one hand it looks like apples and pears, but the acronym SSWB, meaning ""Soul Society West Branch"" says otherwise. In short, it's Tite Kubo again, you can tell by the character models, with one of the main heroines looking like a more mature (not just in one particular body part) and taller Rukie, and the other heroine being a bit of a copy of Hijori, with a short-haired and taller Orihime, actually Marcy here, and I could go on and on like this.... What's worse is the fact that the Ichigo here, well so does Balgo, so far seems like a much more annoying and stupid character - I know at least one person who wouldn't believe that's possible... Anyway, I've seen a brief introduction to an interesting world, it's like Bleach meets the Dragon Hunter and occasionally even borrows a bit from Harry Potter, which I really like and obviously has a lot of rules and weird stuff to offer. Even animation-wise it was quite distinctive, Studio Colorido did a decent job - visually I was intrigued. I could find a few quibbles with the characters, like I've already written about Balgo, but overall I'm interested in them.

As this three part anime series opens we are told that most disappearances in London are due to dragons. Most of the inhabitants can't see them though. There is also a second City of London; Reverse London. Here people are aware of the dragons and they are controlled by 'Wing Bind'. Protagonists Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole are two witches who work for Wing Bind to protect the city. I enjoyed this short series; it is just a pity it didn't have more episodes. The setting is good and the characters are fun to watch. The scenes of them battling against dragons were suitably exciting without being too scary for older children. The plot is simple enough but effective. The character designs aren't as polished as those in most series made these days but they had a distinctive look that I liked.

"Coming into this, I didn't have much expectation at all, to be honest. Now let's all remember that this is an introduction to the series, so this was purely world-building and setting us up for what to come.

This was by no means bad at all, but won't be something I will remember. I do suggest watching this though.

"So I came to this a bit later than most which led to me not realizing this anime/movie is part of the Bleach universe. No where on Crunchyroll's app did it inform me of this nor did it state as much in the beginning. The issue with this is that I have never watched Bleach and have no interest in doing so thus I have no context for the things happening or mentioned in Burn The Witch making it a very confusing a sometimes frustrating watch. Story: This is very difficult for me to rate. As someone who has not watched Bleach I would rate this as a 1 because it felt like I was entering an anime part way through since they barely explained anything important. I'm not sure what a fan of Bleach would rate this but I'm assuming it would be significantly higher. We're introduced to concepts and characters as if we should have some additional information outside what the movie gives us - it's frustrating to watch at times. Burn The Witch feels like the beginning of a longer anime, while at the same time feeling like an arc taking place part way through a longer anime. I can see them possibly making a season 2 after this but they failed with their first season in my opinion. The first season of an anime is supposed to be used to build the characters and world, and this movie did none of that. It gave us ""mysteries"" that we are supposed to care about for some reason, and they rush through an entire arc in an hour. It doesn't feel like a movie at all, and should have been longer so they could explain things better. Also a side annoyance: There's some really bad tonal whiplash when Macy and Balgo are involved in a scene. Art: The art is fine. Nothing special. Sound: Nothing amazing but I didn't hate any of the music or voice acting so it's whatever. Characters: I don't care about any of the characters in this anime. I feel no connection to them and they barely show any personality traits outside a single one. Noel is boring and generic. She's the typical serious half of a duo and has no interesting personality traits. Ninny is the opposite of Noel. Shocker. She's like... famous I guess? She's part of a band I think but it doesn't really delve into that at all even though one of the main antagonists is linked to a former member of her band who also becomes a semi-important character toward the end. Speaking of, Macy is both sad and annoying. Her backstory and personality really shine through during the little screen time she has but holy crap is she the cause of some tonal whiplash. One moment she's pouring her heart out to Ninny, the next second it goes full comedy with her throwing shit at Noel. It's terribly paced and feels very out of place. Tonal whiplash from Macy is nothing compared to Balgo though. Balgo has no good qualities at all. He's stupid, ignorant, weak, pathetic, perverted, and happy-go-lucky. He never takes anything seriously in a ""I have no idea what's going on even though I'm going to die"" kind of way that is not at all appealing. I don't mind flippant characters if they apathetic or cocky, but Balgo is neither of those. He's just really really stupid and situationally tone deaf. He has no redeeming qualities and the way Ninny treats him is the main reason Ninny is the best character in the anime. There's a handful of other characters but most are not important, and the few that are aren't very interesting or relevant. Besides Bruno probably. He's like the big bad for 5 minutes and then he joins forces with Ninny and Noel to take down Cinderella (who just so happened to be named Elly by Macy even though she had no idea she was actually Cinderella so... that was dumb). He's brash, egotistical, and cocky. He's fine I guess? Not a highlight though. Enjoyment: As a not fan of Bleach I didn't find this enjoyable at all. Some of the art design was neat, and the magic system seems interesting if strange (and not explained at all). Some interesting concepts that don't get any real screen time or explanations. It was only an hour so it wasn't worst, and I wouldn't call it boring so it was fine. Overall I'm not sure if I would recommend this anime or not. It has some interesting concepts but is sometimes confusing and annoying. Not great. 5/10",5,Mixed Feelings,"Mar 20, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_c4f32a5962,3,4215
"Teaser for the potential to come... So Burn the Witch's ""movie"" is another of Tite Kubo's manga adaptations brought into anime and for what these 3 episodes has shown us as a ""sneak peak"" as it were LA is VERY intrigued and a bit invested into this IP. Burn the Witch's premise has most of the hallmarks of Tite Kubo's writing but heightened in some ways but still lacking in details due to the screentime of this ""teaser movie"". Burn the Witch's premise is also interesting in which there are ""Reverse"" Worlds and in London, dragon roam, Pipers eliminate them all the while humans who come into contact with them get executed, though there are humans form the ""Real World"" can go into the Reverse World and harbor dragons being ""Dragonclad"" and they are used to ""bait"" other dragons. The characters are also interesting, from the aggressively tsun Ninny Sprangcole voiced by Asami Tano a former singer turned Piper along with her partner the stoic teasing Noel Niihashi voiced by Yuina Yamada and the bumbling aloof idiot Balgo Parks voiced by Shinba Tsuchiya who's a dragonclad and has a MASSIVE crush towards Noel. The first three episodes mainly centres on Balgo for the first episode, while the last two centres on Ninny due to the other character of Macy Baljure voiced by Saori Hayami who used to be in same idol band Ninny was in and she somehow ended up in Reverse London. Though on this front, Noel seemed to be the most reactionary in the cast let laone we not knowing much about her besides her being Ninny's partner. Though to counteract this, Burn the Witch's world building was MASSIVELY interesting from how the structure of the Reverse London handles it's dragon problem to the higher ups, something Tite Kubo is adept at in writing. The world building all within the three episodes though giving us exposition but needed nonetheless, fleshed out Reverse London and it's workings all the same and made LA invested into it much more easily at that too. The animation done by Studio Colorido was done extremely well, with Tite's style pretty much shown through it's character designs off the bat to the good to great battles shown. Really not much else to say besides that the animation OOZES Tite's style and flair and Studio Colorido captured that brilliantly. The voice cast was also pretty good with some relatively new seiyuu's like Yuina Yamada to Shinba Tsuchiya to some veteran and somewhat rookie seiyuu's like Saori Hayami and Asami Tano in the voice cast, nonetheless the voice cast was REALLY good from Saori Hayami's quick changing cadence to Yuina's more stoic-ness reminding LA of Saori Oonishi. If LA had to pin LA's favoruite seiyuu in this cast..........Asami Tano, with Yuina Yamada as a close second. Nonetheless decent to almost great voice cast. LA sees massive potential in Burn the Witch and in this regard kinda makes LA want to return back into Bleach in this regard and yes Bleach and Burn the Witch does have connection which is shown near the end of the 3rd episode and to this regard, though Burn the Witch's characterization is lacking as well as the first episode's ""incident"" glossed over for plot and screentime reasons kinda rushing things, LA could see that being fleshed out from the teaser we got here. If anything if Burn The Witch manages to actually get a full series off this, LA will and would actually watch it as this teaser pretty much cemented that fact that it's something to dig into and having all the potential it can to be something HUGE if it can be, but we'll more or less see if Burn the Witch actually gets a full anime series in due time. The ""teaser movie"" has tons of potential, let's just hope for the best as this might be Tite Kubo's peak writing but for the teaser movie itself it shows promise and LA was decently invested in it and liked it more or less.

"Fair warning-This is my first review. I went into this not realizing it was a ""movie,"" so I was definitely a bit bummed when I realized I wasn't getting any more episodes, haha. However, a season 2 has been announced for the manga, and I'm hoping that will get an anime adaptation eventually. Burn The Witch has an overflowing well of potential to tap into. It did a great job of setting up the world and characters and giving a reason to be invested in them. As a complete story on its own, it's definitely a bit lacking. I feel as though the time spent on the EDs would have been better spent wrapping everything up. Each episode feels like it isn't entirely resolved, at least not on-screen. Instead, it's wrapped up at the beginning of the next episode, which is fine, but it's not entirely satisfying. I wanted to see more of the resolution. It's a bit jarring to cut from a high-intensity scene at the end to the next day where everything is fine and low-stakes again. Perhaps a more traditional movie length and structure would have benefited this series. Still though, what we *do* have is very enjoyable and absolutely gorgeous. The character designs are simple and clean yet dynamic and striking; they convey a great deal of character while not being overly complex. The simple and clean artstyle compliments the animation greatly, which is fluid, dynamic, and very creative. This is most certainly a 'spectacle' anime. If nothing else, it is absolutely worth watching for the gorgeous animation and spectacular cinematography. I'm not really well-versed enough in cinematography to explain why it's so good, but everything just flows together really well, and it feels very exciting to watch. The characters also have great chemistry and bounce off each other very well. Sometimes, the characterization can feel a bit off and out of nowhere, but overall, it's very strong. The main two girls especially have very strong personalities that are a joy to watch, especially together. Overall, while this may not be a masterpiece, I found it throughly enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who might be considering watching it. It's not a big timesink by any means, so there's not much to lose if you end up not enjoying it after all.",8,Recommended,"Oct 11, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9be55b4f4a,3,2252
"Burn the Witch is the definition of a cashgrab that relies purely on the fame of a previous work of its autor in order to sell and it otherwise offers nothing of value. It’s supposed to be some sort of spin off that takes place in the same setting as Bleach but it has absolutely nothing in common with it. I didn’t make a review of Bleach because there is no point in doing that, since everyone and their mothers already talked about it both positively and negatively, but I will make comparisons between the two. First thing to notice is how it takes place in a different country, nothing wrong in that, and it goes for a urban/contemporary fantasy and magic realism type of story, meaning the normal people is more or less aware of everything that happens (in one side), unlike in Bleach where neither the Hollows nor the Shinigami could be seen by people with weak spiritual energy…at first, something that changed completely later on. This would be pretty interesting if said normal people would get a role in the story but as of yet they don’t do nothing of importance, heck, they are not even allowed to interact with the monsters, which here are presented in different form than they had in Bleach, as dragons. Another thing where is weaker than Bleach is having a much lighthearted tone. Although Bleach has lots of silly comedic moments from beginning to end, the first episodes have a creepy atmosphere with a haunting soundtrack at times, something which was completely lost here. For something positive, the Soul Society here works completely different, it no longer follows a military logic with clear borders that separates the japanese elite from the poor and miserable foreigners (cough) but instead works as some kind of company where the Soul Reapers are some kind of employees that hunts the hollows in pairs for credits. Believe or not, this is a good thing, in Bleach, the Reapers sent on a mission could be a single soldier or both the captain and lieutenant of a squad which was kind of sily if you think about it. Why would you send a single person on a mission, or why would you do that with the two biggest authorities of a squad, leaving it behind without leadership and boy was the Gotei 13 lucky that they never received an attack at the same time. Also, I never understood why the captains have only one lieutenant and only one squad under their supervision. And the ranks were complete bullshit, with stronger people serving under weaker people at times. None of that nonsense is present here, as everyone has the chance to get a higher rank just by working a lot. Also, the Gotei 13 is presented much sooner and they already began moving in order to capture some sort of legendary weapons/creatures which are seemingly going to be important later on. What I didn’t like is how the place feels like a school, is there really a need to have a school in everything, especially if it involves magic? Anyways, the premise is more or less the same as in Bleach only less interesting because of the lack of a creepy atmosphere as I already said but also because the characters here are complete shit. The black haired girl is the only one who is completely serious about what she does and does not take bullshit from anyone, but she’s also so serious she’s just boring to watch. The blonde one is just Hiyori from the Vizards in steroids and man is she annoying. And still not as much as the guy, he’s so stupid, he ruins any attempt at seriousness. And there’s also a yandere type of antagonist who has a crush on the blonde girl and just like with the guy, I was expecting for the moment both of them die on screen, which obviously didn’t happen because they are going to be main characters later on. Another problem in the show is how the spells are totally boring, they are just light beams of different colors and that’s it, nothing like in Bleach where they had all sorts of shapes and functions and I need to point out how the characters keep pulling powers out of nowhere, in fact that is how the anime ends, leaving any sort of closure completely open for it is just a prologue which exists only to promote the manga. That is another issue it has, it’s too short and silly to make anything feel important, and on top of that, since it clearly wanted to promote the manga, it skipped the pilot chapter which shows how the main characters get together and are connected, none of that is present here, which could have worked as a bit of their backgrounds. It also feels uninspired, with the dragons flying around it just feels like you are watching something made by Hiro Mashima, and the two sides from the same city, which seem to work as some sort of parallel dimensions connected to each other (I’m only guessing, it’s never explained), is basically taken from Harry Potter, with the only difference being that the “muggles” know what happens here and can move from one side to another under certain circumstances. I like how the legendary weapons/creatures are based on classic fairy tales, I’ll give it that, but even then it’s nothing I hadn’t seen done already in Read or Die, in a much more creative and fun way. Ultimately, what everyone who watched this really cared for was the action and the visuals, and I have to admit that they are not bad, but when they are praised beyond the point they deserve, I have to point out how neither of these elements are that great either. By comparison, in the same season, Majo no Tabitabi and Akudama Drive came out and Burn the Witch just pails before them. And in the same year we got the likes of Tower of God, Deca-Dence and Fog Hill of Five Elements, all of which are also far better and more spectacular than this show in these aspects. Another thing that was praised about it are the character designs and I don’t understand why, Kubo knows how to draw his stuff but he also tends to repeat the faces of his characters a lot, in Burn the Witch, the black haired girl is basically a mix between Orihime and Bambietta from Bleach and as I said the blonde is an aged up Hiyori. The same thing can be said about every other character, they resemble the characters from Bleach a lot and the artwork lacking in details does not help them either. There is a character with a somewhat original design, but he has the same problem as Mirio from My Hero Academia, he resembles a famous character (Luigi) a lot and the chances of liking his design are gonna be divisive because of that. The special effects are not bad but for a show where they throw magic left and right, they could and arguably should be better, the best things in the visuals are the backgrounds, the city looks really good. The motions are fine but nothing really surprising, again I feel like they could have been better and at times they felt kinda sloppy. They feel consistently fluent and fast paced but it’s mostly because of the camera work, which follows every movement the girls make with and without their brooms. And as I said, Majo no Tabitabi did it better. I have nothing to say about the sound, the sound effects lack impact, the voice acting is one of the same you can hear everywhere, the music is alright but nothing really memorable. And that’s it, there isn’t really much else to comment about it, it’s short, it’s just a prologue, it’s mostly silly and nonsensical, poorly written, it has trashy characters, it feels disjoined from the series it’s supposed to be related to, it feels derivative in some elements, everything it does has been done before (for better or worse) and it’s not amazingly animated, it also had the bad luck of airing in 2020, the anti hype year, and thus it didn’t caused as much impact as expected, but I guess it served to remind the audience that Bleach will get a sequel soon, let’s see if this one still retains its audience and manages to sell once that adaptation of a somewhat hated arc is over.",3,Not Recommended,"Dec 24, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_d99b2e251d,4,7899
"In an alternate universe, there exists a ""Reverse London"", a place where people can see the dragons but that alone isn't issue. Despite their enormous size compared to humans, dragons can still infect normal humans into becoming something inhumane. Keep along with ""Noel & Ninni,"" the well-known kouhai/senpai team in WB (Wing Bind), as they cope with a misfortunate pervert who can't seem to quit attracting these lethal beasts. ""Merits"" The anime's aesthetic department is unquestionably its most outstanding feature. The visuals alone make it worth to watch, thanks to the appealing character designs, vibrant animation, and frequently spectacular camera movement during its action scenes. You won't find the most brilliantly written characters or the most compelling world-building in this fantasy tale. The anime has an introduction and all the necessary elements to begin a plot, but by the time it's over, it feels like you've simply watched a bunch of episodes from the middle of a previously aired show. But the characters make it fun, atleast. Ninni and Noel are definitely the charm of the show. The tsundere senpai and the calm kouhei dynamic is a fun to watch and there is also an often-wonderful display of their relationship in some nice emotional moments. Balgo is only important for the sake of plot. He has little emotional depth which is overshadowed by his carefree lifestyle and perverse attitude towards Noel. Like, come on, ma boy. The world is filled with magic and dragons out there, and you are still going after a girl with big breasts. Macy is a bit emotionally unstable, and the anime takes some tonally different visual choices to express her issue, but a small-time limit and a forgettable backstory makes her hard to connect with. Bruno is cool, I guess. ""Downsides"" The fact that this collection of ONAs and isn't a film is one of the biggest issues with it. It turns out it originally was a film, only released in Japan as a one-hour film. Crunchyroll, however, had this strange idea to split the movie into three episodes, which creates this needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. But the ED, however, is still a very chill song to vibe with. ""Conclusion"" Short, to the point, and Fun. The ONA stands on its own. Unless you're finding for something 'complete', I see no reason to not watch this ONA. If you are in a busy schedule but got an hour to spare or are just bored and want something entertaining, this will be a fun little jaunt you would like to take.",7,Recommended,"Feb 25, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_079a48ef0d,4,2673
"Burn the Witch is a mixed bag. The story itself is a 6/10, but it has many redeeming qualities that elevate it to a 7/10, such as the animation and some creative elements. There could be a good story here if it were a 24-episode season to further flesh it out. However, it ends just as things were getting interesting. There are hints of a larger and more interesting narrative/mystery but it is unfortunately limited by its short format.

"Let's get this straight, I had read the manga days before this had release, and comparing them, you're better off just reading it. You lose the prologue of how Balgo becomes a dragonclad and that's really it. What carried me through this ""movie"" was Noel. Waifu material, buckaroo. If you're trying to watch this to get Bleach nostalgia, then this will do it, the art style can easily be compared to that of Bleach and if you want comparison. Noel is like Rukia, Ninny is a female Renji, and Balgo is most similar to Kon.

"This anime is the best kind of ok. An ok that has fun and sometimes rises above mediocrity to deliver a fun, but forgettable experience. The story is by far the worst thing. It feels like walking into a movie at the end of act 1 and leaving said movie before the ending. The world meanwhile is really imaginative. Reverse London is an improvement in almost every way when compared to the Soul Society, from its rules to its looks. The characters are in some gray area of quality between the confusing story and the great world. The standouts are Ninny and Bruno. Their loud personality and great really made them pop out. But then you have Balgo and Macy, both underdeveloped and in the case of the former wasted as the horny comic relieve Writing-wise, this is decent, but far from the hights Bleach once reached. What this has that Bleach doesn't is budget. Kubo already designed some of the most appealing and expressive character designs, so seeing these designs moving fluidly is a treat for the eyes. The score is also really good. My favorite piece was the ending Nill, its melody and singing make you think that this will be an emotional and action packed modern fantasy and I hope it becomes that. When you watch Burn the Witch, remember that this isn't really a movie is more a pilot for a new IP. And as far as pilots go, this is not that bad. Might even watch the anime that will be released if this generates enough hype.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 13, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_abf35aedf8,4,1434
"This movie seems to pretty much just be a commercial for the manga. For me that's not necessarily a bad thing, as I did enjoy most of what it had to offer. First of all I gotta say, this movie was way too short. A movie split into 3 anime length episodes was too little and is one of the biggest setbacks this film has. The story starts way to abruptly with minimal explanation and the overall story suffers because of this. There just isn't enough time to properly introduce the character's or pull you into the plot. While the story isn't anything too special, I did find myself liking some of the character's even if they were pretty shallow. Now for the art, animation and sound I have very little complaints. The character design is well done, something Kubo Tite never seems to fail on. The animation was smooth and well done. I only noticed the 3D animation being slightly jarring once at the start, other than that I can't say I even noticed it being used much. Other then that, the art style is clean and I loved the color palette. The sound was really good and varied. I found myself liking a lot of the background music and the ending song was decent as well. All in all this series has good potential and I hope Kubo Tite is able make something great out of this. The movie did suffer quite a bit from being so short, but I'm excited to see where this goes.

"You ever anticipate an upcoming show or movie expecting to be completely entertained? Well, this isn't that. It was merely OK. The background work was great. But the character art felt flat to me. It looks like a lot of the current style of computer animation that for the sake of production speed, they sketch out the characters with minimalized details and then use a paint bucket tool to fill in the color. A stark contrast to the beautifully detailed background work. The sound work was nicely done, no complaints there and the music blended in beautifully as well. The problem is with the overall story. It felt like taking a twenty-four episode series season and condense it down into a one hour show. You learned only some bare basics about a couple of the characters and the rest are just chum for the water. And that is a huge problem as we have two lead characters with Noel and Ninny, two secondary characters with Balgo and Macy, a tertiary character with Billy, and an antagonist with Bruno. But we only learned a little about Ninny and Macy. And we learn that dragons are apparently attracted to Balgo who is the comic relief really. Spoilers below The initial premise (other than defending against dragons), is that a group puts a hit order out on Balgo. So the girls have to attempt to keep him alive. Meanwhile, Ninny's friend is dragged to Reverse London because she has a pet dragon. So Macy is dragged into the fight between the girls and Bruno, as her dragon transforms into an all-powerful dragon and starts destroying Reverse London. And just as the fight is going to have to come to a climax, Balgo somehow transforms his horn into an almightly looking sword. So you think that Balgo may end up being the hero.

"Burn the Witch, more like burn the whole series. I’m going to keep this short and simple. Keep in mind, this may contain spoilers. I personally didn’t expect this to be a so-called ‘movie’ with 3 episodes. Let’s begin on how this ‘movie’ is presented. First episode, without a doubt, must give a big impression to the viewers, in this case Burn the Witch actually does. It starts with Ninny helping her friend Noel on doing contracts(?) and developed from that. Moreover, the first episode packs quite the action with cool scenes and effects which I find very pleasant to watch. However, the second episode was probably the point where it just collapsed. I don’t want to get into details on each episode so I will only discuss the (really) main plot. Balgo, a normal human being marked as a dragonclad, was to be executed for having contact with a dragon. Why is this like this you ask? Well I really don’t know why since the 'movie' didn’t give any proper context in the first place. I can’t really tell why the 'movie' didn’t give context but it just keeps on adding new things without really explaining it properly. It’s like there are 2 things happening at once, and then another 2 followed on, and so on. However, in these action packed episodes, it made me feel that there is much more that’s going to happen, and I personally was really looking into it. Guess what, the producers slapped my cheeks so hard and said ‘no more episodes and explanations for you, here take the somewhat good animation quality and stay quiet!’ The characters were fairly interesting by itself. We have Ninny, a tsundere-styled girl; Noel, an expressionless friend of Ninny; and Balgo, the ignorant guy that’s going to be important to the story. I described these characters with only a few words because mainly the studio didn’t give any background to them, or show who they truly are and what they’re capable of. It really made me feel like the characters aren’t important to the whole series. As for the visuals and audio, it is pleasing for me. Like I said, the art was pretty nice with a nice touch of style to it. The voice acting was fine, nothing really special about it, and the soundtracks were able to fit in well with the 'movie'. To sum up, Burn the Witch was a disaster when it comes to the pacing and plot. However if you’re looking for some short movie and just want to clear your mind without using too much brain power, this ‘movie’ is probably not the one you want to go with since it may leave you disappointed in the end.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_b47bf5953e,4,2526
"I’ve been meaning to check out Burn The Witch since it was released on Crunchyroll last October. Despite its slick animation and memorable designs, as we’ve come to expect from Bleach creator Kubo Tite, this fiery fantasy unfortunately underwhelms. This could be symptomatic of the adaptation dropping so early into the manga’s run, but there was just too little character development and world-building for a setting that could have otherwise been great. Between ‘Dragonclads’, ‘Watchers’, and ‘Märchen’, there’s simply too much lore and not enough time to flesh anything out. I don’t always mind comedic subversions of dramatic moments, but this happens every single time something impactive arises, making it difficult to connect with the text. The characters, as cool as they look, are the tropiest tropes to ever trope. The clearest motivation and arc can be found in the black and blue-haired support who appears in part two, while the mains are just archetypal tsundere and kuudere, respectively. Burn the Witch felt more like a pilot episode than a feature, so if they come out with more, I’ll check it out, as I do think the overall story has potential. In the meantime, if you’re after a fantasy anime featuring dragons, I’d recommend Ancient Magus Bride instead.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 7, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_83735a53b7,4,1273
"Most of us are here for one reason, we heard that Burn The Witch was written by the author of Bleach, it peaked our interest and so we gave it a chance. But what a disappoint it was. Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" in a 3 episode format, except they're not even full-length episodes. Each episode is only about 18 minutes long after you take out the screen time used for the ending. This means that Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" that isn't even an hour long. Movies are already hard pressed for time when it comes to building an exposition, building up for a climax, and then an ending that wraps up everything nicely. Burn The Witch did none of this nicely. Art: 6 Nothing is really wrong with the art and animation. I actually fairly enjoy the art style and have no issues with it. The reason I'm giving it a 6 however is because this is supposed to be a ""MOVIE"". However the art and animation just feels like a standard anime. There are many anime that look much better than it. Sound: 5 Not much to say here. None of the songs really stuck out to me or really caught my attention. There was no song that made me go ""I want to listen to this again in my free time."" Story: 6 The format for the three episodes are as follows: Episode 1 - Introduction to Characters & World Episode 2 - Minor Backstory and Buildup to Climax Episode 3 - Climax and Conclusion. I will admit the first episode I think was very well done. It introduced the characters we would be seeing the most of us, it gave us a nice introduction to the setting and how the rules are in Reverse London when it comes to dragons. It even gave us a nice and entertaining fight with a dragon to show off what our main characters Noel and Nina can do. Episode 2 felt really rushed. I didn't really care much for Mary or the way she was introduced. It all felt sort of half ass done. This is where the 18 minute screen time really comes into play (I think. I haven't read the manga so I'm not sure how religious it is the source material). It really hurt because not much time was allowed for proper build up. While I did enjoy episode 3 I also have some big complaints. They go on to fight this ""legendary"" dragon and they even go into some dialouge where they name all the legendary dragons BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS BECAUSE AFTER THEY BEAT THIS ONE DRAGON THE SERIES JUST ENDS. The last few minutes also didn't really feel like much of a proper ending as well, it more so just felt like a normal ending for a normal episode that would be continued later on. It literally just feels like I watched the first 3 episodes of a 12 or 25 episode anime. Why waste time naming all these legendary dragons when none of that will be explored, why give me an ending that doesn't feel like a movie ending and more so just feels like there should be an episode 4? This adaptation is literally based off of only the first 4 chapters of the Burn The Witch Manga. There is no chapter 5... yet. At the end of chapter 4 it says ""Season 2 Coming Soon."" I wish they would've just not adapted this until they had enough content for a full series. These 3 episodes just feel like an introduction to the setting and the legendary dragons, it does not feel like a movie because the story isn't complete. A movie has a complete ending, Burn The Witch just makes me feel like I haven't watched the other 9 episodes of a 1-cour anime.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 6, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_3ae37efcaa,4,3364
"Hello there, as always watch something before anyone tells you anything! That being said, the mini-series was fine(don't let the other review tell you otherwise) but the feeling that there is still a hell lot more to offer was almost nauseating. If you've read any the reviews here you'll know that guys are pleased and are giving it a high score with the expectation that the manga will swoop in, sell big, explain things and more episodes will come our way. Woe unto thee who thinks the manga is going to solve any issues you may have had the show. Let me just list a few down. - The stoic stand in for Byakuya, who actually has an emotional side - The tsundere stand in for Renji, - The easy-going old-man that is far stronger than anyone else ever thought. - The references to past events that won't be covered - The references to a league of people or creatures who have some sort of power level stratification - Unexplained objects that do nothing but will somehow save the day - and many many more These are just some of the issues covered by SuperEyepatchWolf who has a great video addressing some of the issues he had with Bleach and the realization that that ugly head is rearing itself again just makes me depressed. Unfortunately, just try to think about what happens in the community when someone hasn't watched or played or read something from this split story. Stratification is what happens. There will be people who know the full story and those who don't. People will gate-keep. Some people will become outsiders. This at-least is my explanation why other reviews here start will full-fledged anime fans apologizing for not having read Bleach. Why is that a thing? We shape the industry because we are the clients, so the ugly head is not an ugly head. It's a mirror that shows me what the community is. Learn to distance oneself from the parasocial relationships one forms with characters, studios, staff, authors and artists/illustrators.

"The only thing I can say about this 'movie' ,is that its at most a meh. In reality I don't even think the anime deserves a 6, the only reason I gave that score is the animation and the sound design. Its way to short even for an actual movie, without the ending credits I don't even think the whole run time would reach the hour mark. Now don't get me wrong, if this was a full fledged 12-ep anime, it would be way way higher but as a 3ep 'movie' it just doesn't work. I think its an amazing anime with just a very short story (the manga is this short too).",6,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_45113aca97,4,556
"I'm disappointed in everything that really mattered, the story, the characters and the world. The Art and the sound: Good, nothing to complain about, there weren't any scenes that I will remember tomorrow... The story: It feels like two people who didn't communicate at all about the story, wrote and animated the first and the second part, and then made a sloppy third part that kind of ties everything together. The characters: Imagine that each character is a painting, well all the characters in this anime are basically one color canvases, with a small splash of some other colors. If I said the horny one, the cold one, the crazy one, the greedy/ambitious one and the ambitious one without any morals, anybody who has seen the show will know who I'm talking about. Also to establish the character motivations for some of them, they decided to add one line that tells the audience what they desire. The world: It's even more disappointing then the characters, unlike the characters that never showed potential to be amazing, deep and memorable, it was, From the trailers it makes you imagine that there is some kind of struggle that the average person can't see, the dragons, but can feel the impact of, streets and building getting destroyed, this might even be the case, except for the fact that we don't get to see it, do see that chunks of the ""Reverse London"" get torn up, but they never explain if this effects the normal world. Also why is it called ""Reverse London"", are dragons not a thing anywhere else? Basically the more you think about it, the more you realize that important parts of the world aren't explained.

"Burn the Witch comes across as a promotional trailer for a bigger series rather than a standalone experience. It has well-designed characters and an intriguing setting. However, it feels superficial. And with the short runtime the plot feels rushed and underdeveloped, with little room for character growth. Despite the promising premise and visually stunning art, it is difficult to recommend in its current form, as it lacks substantial content and ultimately feels incomplete.

"So let me get this straight... This was a *movie*? Not the first three episodes of a season? As a movie this is probably one of the most terrible things I've seen. You don't split a movie in 3 parts with different ending songs inbetween, and should certainly end in a way that suggests that the anime is not going to go on for another 10-20 episodes. I'm giving it a 5/10 just because it should be a 6/10 average anime of the season, it's just that it completely fails to be a movie. Should honestly give it a 2-3/10 because it's simply not a movie. It'd be like saying a 5min Youtube video is a manga, and then you rate it. Like no, that's not a manga. 2 decent enough MCs, interesting setting, fair OST (I dig the ending though), but this should've been a 12 episode show. Not a 3 episode ""movie"".

"Burn The Witch is a 2020 anime film based off of a Kubo Tite manga. That's right, the creator of Bleach. The anime version was handled by Studio Colorido. Which I've never reviewed anything by. Let's have a look. Story: Our story centres around the idea that there are two Londons. The London we know and Reverse London, where dragons roam and need to be kept under strict control. Our heroines are two witches, Ninny and Noel. They help bring a rampaging dark dragon under control only to find themselves entangled in a plot that's all about bringing down one of their friends. Here's the big problem with the narrative, there are a lot of things that aren't explained very well. The film throws out a lot of terms and concepts very quickly but never extrapolate on them all that well. For example, there are people who can come into contact with dragons but most can't and there's never a detailed explanation for why. It seems to be something to do with mana but the film never explains how mana works in its world. It's like Kubo wanted to set up a long series to follow up after Bleach, but he never got past the planning phase. This is also supposed to take place in the Bleach universe, but none of the abilities or creatures seem to operate anything like the fantasy creatures or abilities in Bleach. Which is weird. There's just no coherent reason for this and Bleach to be connected. The film also suffers a bit from a rushed climax with the big battle sequence ending with a disappointing anti-climax. To its credit, this film is full of interesting ideas that have a lot of potential. I could see this as a really good twenty six or more episode series with proper pacing and fleshed out concepts. The problem is it's an hour long film. I will also say, to its credit, it was fairly compelling throughout. Characters: My big problem with the characters was that I hated Balgo. He's one of those characters who comes across as a complete moron but he's supposed to be likeable because he's a friendly and inoffensive moron. I just really found him insipid. I do think that both Ninny and Noel are pretty interesting characters and I could see them becoming really complex given more time. But for the length, I don't think they could have been done much better. With most of the side characters you get the sense that Kubo has ideas for them but they don't really go anywhere and the characters themselves end up being a little lacklustre. Art: The artwork does look pretty good. I especially love the big dragon they face for the climax. The action is also interesting to see. There's a definite unique aesthetic to the way characters use magic in this and I'm kind of into it. Sound: The acting is pretty well done. Yamada Yuina, Tano Asami & Hayami Saori all perform strongly and there's not really anyone who does badly. Even the performances that aren't as good are still competent. The music is fine. Ho-yay: There's a little bit. The character Macy openly has a crush on Ninny. Areas of Improvement: 1. Extrapolate on how your world works. This film is full of potential that never quite gets reached and ideas that never get fleshed out properly. It would work so much better with a little time taken to flesh it out. 2. There's no reason for this and Bleach to take place in the same universe. Connecting these two is both unnecessary and doesn't make much sense. There's this sense of disconnect between the works and telling us that our heroines work in Reverse London's Soul Society just isn't an adequate connection. 3. Have a more satisfying conclusion. It's a bit disappointing that the big climactic battle just ends abruptly and far too easily. It makes the whole thing just feel unfinished. Final Thoughts: This is one of those works where there's clearly a lot of potential and some strong elements, but the potential is never fully realised and the strong elements are met with a lot of weaker aspects. Ultimately, I do think this is better than mediocre but not by a large margin. So, I'm giving it a 6/10.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 21, 2021",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0eb5242c82,4,4038
"This is my first review I've done in a long time, for good reason....I am not a good reviewer but, here it goes. Burn the Witch...while you were a animation greatness galore, your pacing was confusing and you were way too quick, hell even boring at times. In my eyes, the animation studio should have waited for more material to go off of, but instead they decided to throw this at us, I hardly knew what was going on half the time even. While I enjoyed this anime, it was rushed. I am not a Bleach fan at all, so that may have played a part in this, but even still...I am sure most Bleach fans were at least a little confused as I am.

"Burn the Witch Review What if dragons weren’t just mythical creatures but an everyday part of life—and only a select few could control them? Burn the Witch, by Bleach creator Tite Kubo, explores this thrilling premise in a stylish, action-packed fantasy set in Reverse London. About the Anime Released in October 2020, Burn the Witch is a three-episode ONA (Original Net Animation) adapted from Kubo’s manga. The manga began as a one-shot before evolving into a short serialized story. The anime currently holds a solid 7.15 rating on MyAnimeList, reflecting its balance of quality and brevity. A Quick Summary The story follows Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, witches working for Wing Bind, an organization that manages dragons in Reverse London. As they tackle dragon-related incidents, their lives are complicated by Balgo Parks, a reckless civilian entangled in their dangerous world. Why You Should Watch It 1. Fans of Tite Kubo and Bleach Will Feel Right at Home While not reliant on prior Bleach knowledge, the series offers subtle nods to the franchise, including a connection to Soul Society’s Western branch. 2. Strong Female Protagonists Noel and Ninny steal the spotlight with their contrasting personalities and teamwork. Their dynamic elevates the story, offering a refreshing focus on capable female leads. 3. Kubo’s Signature Artwork From detailed cityscapes to stunning dragon designs, Kubo’s artistry is at its peak. Taking his time with this project has allowed him to craft visuals that stand out as some of his best. 4. Perfect for Busy Viewers With its short format (originally a one-shot, then a four-chapter manga and three-episode anime), Burn the Witch is easy to get into without a huge time commitment. Where It Falls Short The story struggles with limited character development for secondary figures like Balgo, Bruno, and Macy. While intriguing, these characters feel underutilized, leaving potential untapped. Before diving into the three-episode ONA, watch the Burn the Witch special episode. It’s a prequel that provides essential context for understanding the story and its world. Burn the Witch brevity may leave some craving more, but for fans of Kubo’s work, it’s a must-watch, If expanded in the future, it has the potential.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 14, 2025",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_e86a4b2731,4,2266
"I like the gist of story itself - I feel like its an asian take on harry potter (even though it is supposedly related to Bleach). Anime/UK crossovers can be really fun if done correctly. Tying together dragons and magic, which is important in asian culture, was an interesting choice. If you read the manga and did your research, the plot is pretty cool but if you are just watching this series(?) the plot has holes in it. To briefly touch on that point... this is technically a movie? but was split into a series? It honestly has no business being considered a series imo. This doesn't happen often, but I really did not like the artistic take. The animation, sounds, etc., just did not vibe well with me. The dichotomy between the detailed (nearly realistic) London scenery and grungy vibes vs. the characters simple design was unsettling but not in a fun way. It seemed like from one scene to the next the stylization changed without reason, which really threw me off. I also thought the dragons themselves looked horribly silly. I feel like overall this is a wash. It has high hopes, but is executed poorly. It is obvious that a lot of work went into making this, but at the same time it feels incomplete.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 18, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_918dfb1b66,5,1210
"For the viewer: don't watch this now. Wait for more. I watched three episodes and was surprised to find that I had seen... a movie, apparently. Right now, while Burn the Witch is quite aesthetically appealing, it is a merchandising story so caught up in placing all the bells and whistles that it fails to be believable or likable. It contains the usual forms: girls with 'personality', throwaway cute characters, stereotype sandwiches, a quelle-meaningful MC catchphrase, thighs, and more thighs. The setting does raises interesting questions - what are dragons?, what is this new society? how does this magic work? - but it's neither well explained nor believable. In three episodes, half the city of London perishes under flames and explosions. That raises some follow-up questions: how is this city still standing? Why do people live here? The characters are also enjoyably frustrating. There is Ninny, our lovely MC, whose response to 'you destroyed half the city and killed thousands!' is 'where's my money!?', Balgo, the village idiot, stereotype gangster 1, stereotype cop 32, quirky anime council members 49-117, et cetera. The only persona who doesn't come with perennial facepalms is Noel; probably because her motives and personality are nil. Burn the Witch failed to be likable. I can't respect it; neither as a viewer expecting excitement nor as an author expecting craft. That said, the future may bring backstory and believability.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 15, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_77ee0ef44c,5,1447
"The ratings speak for itself. It has been a few minutes I finished the ""movie"" and I am still to figure out what happened, or why it happened, or why should people care? Unless there is a follow-up anime planned, or they want you to follow the manga (which at the time of writing this is exactly at the same place), this whole clearly no-a-movie does not make any sense. There is no time to connect to any of the characters, the plot is...difficult to find. And without any kind of follow up, the ending is just anti-climatic. Nothing actually encouraging you to start following the mange or wait for any anime. By the end of the third episode, you are left wanting your hour or something back.

"First of all, I loved and watched every episode of Bleach, except for 2 arcs (being the Thousand Year ""flashback"" arc which I never got back around to watching and the Fullbring arc). I can also understand that people are hyped for the momentous return of Tite Kubo and Bleach in general. However, I do not agree that this ""Burn The Witch"" release is anywhere near an 8/9/10 - out of 10, far from it. I can just about handle people rating this a 7/10, which usually means ""above average"" or ""good"". In my opinion, Burn The Witch seems like a rushed-to-release OVA, rather than an actual movie. If we can even call it a movie, what with it being 3 episodes of 20 minutes. An hour is simply not enough time for any meaningful character development or plot development. The ""story"" follows 2 main characters and one recurring side character, all of whom are one-dimensional, bland, uninteresting and have zero quirks or traits that make them memorable. Not forgetting that the characters back-stories are given about 10 seconds of screen-time, or about 2 sentences worth of dialogue on-screen: Ninny: Ex-idol (I think?) from normal London that fights dragons in reverse London and wishes to be part of the ""blades"". Aims for merit points. She is a copy-paste of Hiyori (Vizard), with her hot-headed attitude, but lacks everything else. Noel: Air-headed, sullen-looking girl who aims for monetary gains and... well, I can't even remember if anything about her past was revealed. Reminds me slightly of Yashiro (Vizard), but has about as much personality as a potato. Balgo(?): so memorable I don't even think I got the name right. Only purpose is to be a nuisance and express his love and adoration of Noel (that comes from nowhere). Also comes from normal London, but got powers from somewhere that causes dragons to be attracted to him. Balgo's pet: literally only says ""show me your panties"", in a Kon-like fashion, but does nothing else. So, there are the 3 main characters. Boring, bland, one-dimensional and have 0 appealing factors to them. If I'm being brutally honest (which I guess I have been already), the character with the most development and intrigue is the ""Chief"", who is on-screen for about 5 minutes total over the course of the hour. What about the plot then? Is that any good? Nope, not really. To avoid plot spoilers, I can say that I can resume the plot in about 3 sentences and it's incredibly cliché and doesn't really go anywhere or do anything. There's some very slight explanation on how reverse London functions and that's the most interesting part of this movie, which could be mashed together in a 10-minute video. Wow, I've been harsh but that's what happens when stuff gets hyped and then underperforms. I'm less critical of ""trash"" anime, because it's expected to be trash. Are there any redeeming factors to Burn The Witch though? Yes! The art-style, art quality, music-score and animation quality are top notch! However, as beautiful as a game/movie/anime might look, if there's nothing besides that, it still falls flat. Story: 3/10 - Poor Art: 9/10 - Great Sound: 8/10 - Very Good Character: 2/10 - Dreadful Enjoyment: 3/10 - Poor Total: 25/50 Overall: 5/10 - Mediocre If this is a one-and-done deal for Burn The Witch, with no follow-up anime series, then this is a massive disappointment and waste of time. It also raises questions about the upcoming ""end of Bleach"" anime arc. Even if this ""movie"" is meant to be a teaser for such a follow-up series, then I really don't expect much from it at this point.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Oct 10, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_0f0a37ab7c,5,3543
"Burn the Witch felt woefully incomplete, like the concept exists on its own and little effort was put in to ensure it became a polished end product. To begin with the story, there really isn't much of one to speak of, though it gives the distinct impression that there is a lot more the viewer doesn't get to see. One can only do so much with a scant 3 episodes, but even then the story felt terse, shallow, and generally uninspired. Which is a shame because the world that the story takes place in is unique, characteristic, and has a lot of potential. The art, meanwhile, is this anime's strongest point, hands-down. The art style impacts every level of this anime's visual language, from the detailed and striking backgrounds, to the fun and well-constructed character designs, and even down to the sheer fluidity with which they move through their world by way of very high-quality animation. The only artistic decision I take issue with is in the design of the 'witch gear' gun things used by our main two characters, Ninny and Noel. They don't don't really fit the rest of their aesthetic, and seem almost jarringly silly as a result. The sound was a very mixed bag. One the one hand The sounds of life, like shattering glass and explosions, are very good, and the music has the ability to be pretty impactful at certain moments. However, to begin my problems with the sound, I watched the English dub because this anime is supposed to take place in the UK, and I thought I'd immerse myself. What a mistake, as the dub is garbage, and features some really questionable translations. The voice actors, while I can tell have some talent on their own, aren't being utilized correctly here, and everybody's delivery is so stiff and unconvincing that I was unable to immerse myself at all, in fact. Also, the music, while fine half the time, lapses into this weird techno bass guitar fusion thing the other half of the time, and it just doesn't fit. That's it, it's a bad musical decision. The characters, thankfully, are pretty good, and the audience is presented with a cast of colorful, visually appealing, and easily memorable characters that each fill their own niche well and interact in vibrant and believable ways. In many ways, the characters pull the weight that the story should be pulling. Overall, Burn the Witch is a beautiful bite-sized adventure that, while not the worst thing I've ever seen, left me feeling grateful there were only 3 episodes.",6,Mixed Feelings,"Aug 28, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_f4c7ed0cdf,5,2463
"I really want to give this a better score, but I'm on the collective side of critics. I felt like I was part way into an anime, and had no idea what I was watching was a movie. I'm not sure if they have plans to make more of this, I know there's an on-going manga being published, but seeing a 3-part episodic Movie had me tilting my head: Was this it? Why did it feel like they set up 2 vast worlds for us, and then delivered... Basically nothing but bits and pieces of story. Story: 7/10 Solid 7 at that, because while it's fun, unique, creative, and leaves open a world of exploration and inventive creative ideas... At the end of the day, what we got was. 2 worlds, hundreds of questions, and no answers in sight for most of them. It's like they showed us this click-bait Youtube title, and then in side of it, we only got a small taste, and they said ""that's all you get."" I'm yearning for more, it's made me want to read the manga, so that's a plus in its favor, but beyond that... Man what an underwhelming performance on something that felt like it could be insanely awesome. Art: 8/10 It's always good when I'm trying to find a way to start a critique on art, and I'm finding myself rewriting, deleting, and rethinking what I'd like to post here. So this is what you get instead. It was beautiful, it gave me these great Bleach vibes (I enjoyed the Bleach artwork very much.) The animation was smooth, I had very little issues with any of it, aside from their 'witch kits'.. Being horns? Guns? Wands? I'm split on that at the moment. TL;DR wow, it was enjoyable to watch this art style. Sound: 6/10 I'm very harsh on sound tracks, and audio. If you have a lot to work with, a good studio backing, or scenes that have potential to blow up with the right tracks, and effects, I'm going to hold it against your show if it fails to deliver. At no point did I ever go ""wait what is this track called? Wow I need to check this artist out to follow more of their work"" It failed to stand out. But it wasn't unbearable. Characters: 6.5/10 I enjoyed the sassy, mixed with the stoic, the charming male character who just seems to be the air head of the group. There was some fun chemistry, but that's where the line mostly stops. You have no background for these characters, you're given the most shallow information on people that we're made to watch over an hour of. What's worse is they dangle small tid bits of information in front of you face, where you expect them to come out and elaborate on. Like my qualms with most shows in this filed... Potential wasted. Enjoyment: 6.5/10 I enjoyed it almost 60% of the way through, and then the other 40% I was left sitting around wondering... And?! ... Please give me something more... Did you just show me an array of characters and do jack with all? Overall a solid 6.5/10 for this one. I summarized all I'd like to say in my points above for those looking for a serious TL;DR: Wasted potential, no character presence, just chemistry. The story was lacking even though I had such high hopes. The artwork is it's biggest saving grace in my personal opinion, and ...

"To be frank, I didn't hate the series. I was just irritated... Although the premise of the story was good, the fatal flaw that the series had is the way it literally bombarded us with information. It gave the series a sense of messiness and the delivery of the information was JUST. SO. RANDOM. The exposition is terrible. That's all I have to say about it. Everything that happened in the series happened so fast, and it's hard to watch it and enjoy it because of the fact that we're trying to keep up. The characters were BARELY developed too.

It somehow has too many exposition and lore dumps, while also leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening at any given time. Each subsequent scene is a disparate mashup of half baked ideas at best, and incomprehensible nonsense at worst. Many characters are introduced and suddenly whisked away, never to be seen again. And the handful of characters that do stick around are bland and grating. However despite this, something about it all continues to stick in my mind. The animation during fight scenes is stunning, and the visual effects for the magic system are some of the best in the industry. The character designs of the two protagonists are top-notch, and even a few background characters are visually striking. The show hints at a greater and more interesting world (and it wasn't until the ending that I realized this was a Bleach spin-off). While the show doesn't give time to care about the characters, they're still quite enjoyable. Truly the protagonists stand out as being the most interesting characters worth paying any attention to. For this series, every great decision is preceded by two mediocre decisions and a bad one. With all this, I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the show that keeps me coming back. Throughout the day I find myself trying to piece it all together despite knowing it's an incomplete and defective puzzle. It's truly a mess of a show, but there's some potential there under all the rubble. If a sequel is ever released, I will definitely watch it, either for closure and clarity, or to see it all crumble. I truly hope it's the former.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Jan 30, 2023",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_20f334f3b2,5,1735
"7/10 (Will this ever be continued?) Over all this was a good watch and I am looking forward to what is next. The show is a bit too ""anime"" for my taste with the obsession over 'panties', arguments over first name/last name, In school? For some reason and the mc being an... idol? Maybe? Other then these small basic quoms about the show, it was beautifully animated, had a compelling world and interesting enough power/magic system. I really just hope this is just in the world of bleach but has nothing to do with it. I personally think bleaches story is atrocious and terribly written and very convoluted for no reason. Hopefully the writter learned from that and doesn't make the same mistake twice.",7,Recommended,"Jun 29, 2024",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_55d2b4eb6d,5,702
"Okay so the short 3 episode animation of Burn the Witch had so much potential from a perspective of someone who's never read the manga. However it's falling so flat that it hurts. The animation and character design? Amazing. But I can't get past the fact that the story is as dry as a saltine cracker, it's not long enough for me to feel connected to the characters but it's also not short enough that I'm not loosing focus on the show. The action scenes don't make me lurch with excitement and the lack of character development that the show gives is rather disappointing. Overall I'd give it a 4.5/10. I'd recommend it but there is so much lost potential. [9:14 PM] Also the way the world building is just there? Gross. I hate everything about it. It feels like I'm reading a Wiki article. I give it essentially a 3 for art, 1 for Balgo, and .5 for potential...",4,Not Recommended,"Oct 8, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_3ad19300f2,5,863
"This review is spoiler-free. First off, this isn't what I'd call a movie, but rather a mini-series or something of the sort. It consists of 3 poorly-linked Anime episodes of 20ish minutes (standard, if you will). Story - 3 There's barely any introduction to the MCs (only a little bit of backstory that's mostly left out to the viewers' interpretation rather than being expanded on or explained). There isn't much to the story honestly, besides meaningless encounters and fight scenes that escalate too quickly and weirdly to be taken seriously. Trying to fit all of it in 3 20-minutes episodes was probably a mistake, since the many roughly touched-on parts of the story couldn't be explained or further explored and developed. To the viewer, it's like the story is simply filled with holes and appears to make no sense (at least to me, that's what it felt like). Also, the transitions between the 3 episodes don't make sense at all to me. That's probably the main reason it didn't feel like a movie when watching them back to back. Art - 6 The Art itself isn't that bad, but it really isn't movie quality (if you compare it to popular and well-ranked movies like Your Name, Weathering with You and such). It's also not a complete and utter dreadful experience for the viewer since there's a consistency - the characters, the environments, the colors used, etc. are always the same and keep the flow steady and natural for the viewer. Sound - 6 I found that one of the supporting characters was truly bugging me and part of it was because of its voice. I simply found it annoying and it sort of ruined the experience for me. Everytime that character was involved in a situation and talked, I'd just roll my eyes in exasperation (yes, it was that bad for me). Otherwise, the music and sound effects were okay, nothing worthy of mention or anything very powerful or too emotional. Just plain decent and basic sounds/music that help the viewer understand what's happening. Characters - 3 As I said in the Story part, there's barely any introduction to the MCs. Whilst watching, I felt like they had no depth since there wasn't any backstory shown or explained. There were little pieces of information left here and there, stuff that the viewer could deduce or interpret their way, but no real background story or anything of the sort. This resulted in pretty bland/generic and boring/annoying characters. I couldn't care less if any of them were to get into a relationship, lose something valuable or whatever. I couldn't find anything to relate to or get attached to. They felt empty to me, void of any substance. Enjoyment - 2 Pretty dull. I didn't really enjoy watching this ""movie"". It kinda felt like a chore to me, just to add it to my Completed Animes list. After seeing it advertised and looking up this Anime, I had high expectations but sadly, they weren't met at all. Most of the action was pointless and provided no character development, if any at all. The show brought up so many unanswered questions in my mind (and didn't answer them) that I didn't understand the point of watching it. Nothing joyful happened, nothing saddening nor heartbreaking happened, it's just the same-old bland and boring meaningless story of stuff happening to the MCs for absolutely no reason other than to make something happen to fill the 60ish total minutes of the show (""movie""). Overall - 4 Yeah, that's just the average of the scores I've given this show. I've got nothing more to say about this so-called ""movie"", except go watch it if you want, but lower your expectations for it first. It's not deserving of a score as high as it is right now. As the score of 4 indicates, it is in my opinion a ""Decent"" show, no more, no less.",4,Not Recommended,"Dec 13, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_c935078cc6,5,3727
"In which dimension was this a good idea to realease this not as a pilot for a full series but as a 3 episode film (if it aired like this in japan and its not just a decision made by crunchyroll). The generall setting of this Anime/Film, a magical second London with dragons, could make a good Anime/Film but After watching these 3 episodes you just ask yourself, where the next episode is or even a conclusion of that Film/Anime, because it just felt like it was like a start to some interesting series but no ist just ends abruptly just like it started. The story revolves around two Girls who aparently work for a company who does things with(like catch?) Dragons or some mythical animals, where the protagonists get money and fame points from that. One of them is a Idol(in the real london) (and is getting catched by paparazzi becasue aparently tabliods press is one of the main story points?) sundere(Spangcole, Ninny), who likes fame, and the other one is a kuudere who likes money(Niihashi, Noel). The only kind of personality which is explored is that Ninny has a friend in the ""normal"" London from their idol band and Noel likes that one boy they meet. The thing is even this seems very shallow it could had potential because the setting could be interessting if its explored in greater detail. This magical london with its conection to dragons the conection between normal humans from this london and dragons and whiches (male and female aparently), the magic from these, the secretary council with their(could be) intereseting powers and names, the boss of their organisation and and and. The whole story just seems lackluster in comparison to other series and just bad if you compare it to a well written film. One good point i have to add is the art it reminds me of the art in bleach(its both written by kubo), combined witch this series/films unique interesting design. Like, that the second London has smaler houses and everything is covered in some moss. In addition the sound design and music is quite interesting. By all means this film/series isn't bad or cheap or just low quality, the art is cool its an interesting setting and the sound isnt that bad but after watching it you just feel like you watched like the 10./11./12. episode of a 25 episode series. Its just sad that its so short it could be so much more. In conclusion its mediocre.

"I don't have all that much to say. I didn't expect much of a story considering it was never Kubo's strong suit in Bleach. However, it seems either Kubo himself was trying to overcompensate for that in this project, or there was no direction in the studio's adaptation (I have not read the source material mind you) Kubo's art and the animation steals the show, no question about it. There are some fun moments here and there, hell I caught myself chuckling once or twice. And the world that is built doesn't seem too original, but distinct enough to intrigue me nonetheless. Otherwise there isn't much to say to praise it. I hope that there is more to come as I do think that if there is more time for the story to come into its own, it can be something good. However for now I find this to be anime junk food. A quick watch that catches the eye, but nothing substantial for it to be remembered as it is.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Feb 26, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9f87be90ac,5,904
"Initial Thoughts: Alright, so this is my first review. I hope to write it somewhat well! I did like this movie. It wasn’t mind-blowing to me, but I do find the concept of it pretty fun. The movie is set in two versions of London: Front London (the London that appears in our world) and Reverse London (the London full of magic, witches, and dragons). The world of “Burn the Witch” gives me many Harry Potter vibes, which I am not at all opposed to seeing. The whole movie sort of feels like a nod towards that franchise. However, it doesn’t appear to be as fleshed out as Harry Potter. There is still a lot left to the imagination on how magic in this universe works, what the different organizations in the world of Reverse London are, and how it interacts with Front London. It's not even clear on who the villains are. Are they the dragons themselves, or are they the shady council people trying to capture Balgo? Who’s to say?! But perhaps that’s the point of the movie-it’s meant to throw you, the viewer, into this fantastical world of dark dragons and spunky witches. You’re meant to experience the world on a joyride, not analyze it. Story: The story was fine. Not something that blew me away, but it also didn’t bore me half to death. As I stated above, there are still plenty of questions about how the world of this movie works that are left unanswered. That’s a bit frustrating, but again maybe that was international. The story itself is also quite fast-paced. It’s as if the movie cobbled together three episodes from the middle of an anime and tried to condense it into an hour-long window. It’s not so fast-paced that the viewer is confused about what is happening, but it still leaves a lot to be desired. The story's main conflict appears to be whether or not Dragon Clads should be protected or killed. That’s all fine and good conflict...but as the movie progresses, it appears the problem is less with the Dragon Clads and more with the dragons themselves? The Dragon Clads are sort of just...there. Attracting dragons, I guess, but the movie never really goes into a lot of depth on just how dangerous a Dragon Clad could be...especially since Balgo and Macy aren’t dangerous characters. You could call Macy unhinged, but she doesn’t have malicious intent. Burn the Witch’s story isn’t all bad, though. I like all of the references to fairy tales and seeing how Ninny thinks they’re all a load of bull. Although the movie never really goes into detail about why Ninny thinks this way either. The fights scenes and learning about the lore of the dragons and world itself are quite fun. That sentence could sum up the story, I suppose. Fun, but it doesn’t appear that the movie will go into more depth than that. Rating: 3/5 Characters: The characters were ok. Not much to write home about. We have Ninny, who lives a dual life as a celebrity in Front London and a witch in Reverse London. She hates fairy tales, is spunky, wants recognition for defeating dragons...and that’s her character. The majority of characters are fairly surface-level without going into a lot of depth about them. Noel is the quiet side-kick, Balgo is the goofy but lovable Dragon Clad, Bangnyfe is the cool but intense wizard who wants to kill Balgo for his own gain, and Macy is a girl who’s in love with Ninny and is clueless in a magical world. I blame the movie's running time for not giving the audience a chance to get to know the characters more. Maybe they appear surface-level now, but a proper series could expand on their potential for being great and memorable characters. The character designs aren’t too bad, though. In fact, they’re quite good! Bangnyfe looks the coolest out of everyone, in my personal opinion, haha. Rating: 2/5 Animation: The animation was really, really good! Probably the best part of the whole movie, if I’m quite honest. It was fluid and vivid, and the action scenes flowed splendidly. There wasn’t anything done that was too experimental. It was just a good shonen animation. There was some CGI animation that was implemented too. I always get nervous seeing CGI animation in anime, but this honestly didn’t bother me much. In fact, it was well-executed for once! If there were animation mistakes or awkward stills, I didn’t really see them myself. Rating: 4/5 Voice Acting: Again, also very good. All of the voice actors conveyed their character’s personalities well and were all pleasant to listen to. I absolutely adored Balgo’s VA. He did such a good job striking a balance between “awkward” and “adorable” in his performance. It’s such a shame that Balgo’s character writing was just so...well, bad. Rating: 5/5 Music: I’m a bit reluctant to write about music since I don’t tend to pay attention to it much. Unless it’s something really unique, but the music for Burn the Witch was fine-nothing particularly stood out, but it did do its job carrying the scenes along. Rating: 2/5 Closing Thoughts: While there are still many questions left unanswered about the movie's world, I would recommend giving this a watch. In my personal opinion, I would like to see this fleshed out a bit more as a regular anime series than as a movie. If there ever will be a show, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for that. But for now, check this out if you’re interested and scratch that itch for Harry Potter in an anime world.

"I can safely say I regret buying into the hype for this ""movie"". It seemed like it tried to keep the plot ""mysterious"" but all it succeeded in doing was confusing my partner and I more. We asked multiple times what something was only to never get an answer. The ""movie"" introduces multiple things in the beginning episodes with no explanation. Another user mentioned it feels like you're watching episode 6 out of 12 without having watched any of the other episodes and I couldn't agree more. It almost seems like the storyboard workers expected you to know the foundation of the story despite never explaining it. The characters are decent, somewhat predictable, but decent. However, with such little time and such little background and development on them, I had no attachment and thus in the final episode could not care less how they felt. The only thing saving this ""movie"" from a horrible review in my opinion is the quality of the art in the anime and the character design. Otherwise, there's no point in watching. I'd be happy to change my mind if they come out with a full in-depth anime or perhaps multiple movies to a series, but until then I'll see this as an overhyped project that doesn't deserve the recognition it's recieving.",5,Mixed Feelings,"Nov 2, 2020",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_9c480e9482,5,1242
"Such an oddly put together anime, I believe I should've read the manga before having this been my introduction to Burn the Witch. The anime starts you off in what feels like the middle of the series in an extremely vague setting and only gets more comboggled; with vague implications of these character's relationships, their power systems, and their motivations. At the very least, Kubos character design is more than amazing. There were so many instances where I found myself pausing to admire the design of certain character's outfits ie, Sullivan Squire. And some where I began to question how boring and odd some of the choices for these character's designs were ie. Bruno and Balgo. It doesn't help that backgrounds/scenery of the anime, like a lot of modern animes, looks so artificial. Really scratching my head after this one. A lot of squandered potential here.",4,Not Recommended,"Apr 16, 2022",Bleach,Bleach TYBW Part 2,41468,bleach_tybw_part_2_5a90483471,5,871
